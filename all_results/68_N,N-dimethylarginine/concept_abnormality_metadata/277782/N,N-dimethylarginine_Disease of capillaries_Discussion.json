    "context": "4.2.2 Diabetic cerebral microangiopathy The underlying pathological condition of diabetic cerebral microangiopathy is arteriosclerosis, which increases the resistance of cerebral vessels. ADMA may increase vascular stiffness and decrease cerebral perfusion in diabetic patients (Faraci, Brian, & Heistad, 1995). Plasma ADMA levels are directly involved in the microangiopathy-related cerebral damage in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients (Iadecola, Pelligrino, Moskowitz, & Lassen, 1994; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011). The PI and RI reflect vascular resistance distal to the artery examined. Impairment in the small intracerebral perforating arteries mainly involved in diabetic cerebral microangiopathy may be evaluated by assessment of the PI and RI in the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries, and MCA (Lee, Young, Baik, Kim, & Kim, 2000; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011; Xiong et al., 2005). In our study, the PI and RI in the ICA and MCA correlated with plasma ADMA, plasma AGE, hsCRP, DM duration, HbA1c, cystatin C, and eGFR, data consistent with previous studies (Petrica, Petrica, Munteanu, et al., 2007; Petrica, Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2007; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011; Xiong et al., 2005).

        "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is implicated in diabetic cerebral microangiopathy, a disease affecting capillaries. Elevated plasma ADMA levels are associated with increased vascular stiffness and decreased cerebral perfusion in diabetic patients, contributing to microangiopathy-related cerebral damage. The study highlights a direct correlation between plasma ADMA and vascular resistance metrics, indicating its role in capillary disease pathology.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between N,N-dimethylarginine and diseases of capillaries, particularly in the context of diabetic cerebral microangiopathy. The evidence presented shows a clear relationship between elevated ADMA levels and vascular dysfunction, supported by quantitative data.",
