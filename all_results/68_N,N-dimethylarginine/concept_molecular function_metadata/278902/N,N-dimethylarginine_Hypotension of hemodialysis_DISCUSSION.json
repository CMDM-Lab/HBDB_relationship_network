    "context": "Cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) did not change significantly during the dialysis and was comparable between the three groups Figure 4 . DISCUSSION Nitric oxide and ET-1 contribute to the complex regulation of local and systemic vascular resistance, distribution of blood flow and oxygen delivery, sodium balance and arterial pressure 18 , 19 . Excessive NO can result in systemic hypotension as in septic shock; conversely, impaired NO synthesis may lead to pathologic vasoconstriction, tissue ischemia with organ dysfunction, and to the genesis or perpetuation of hypertension 18 . We found that the pre-dialysis FENO was elevated in patients prone for intra-dialytic hypotension, but serum NT, L-Arg and ADMA levels were not significantly different in patients with and without hypotension. Concentrations of NT, ADMA and L-Arg decreased post-dialysis, but FENO increased compared to pre-dialysis values in all the patients. However, the intradialytic change in ET-1 levels did not follow a uniform pattern. Compared to the pre-dialysis value, the post-dialysis ET-1 level increased in patients with rebound hypertension, decreased in patients with dialysis induced hypotension, but remained unchanged in the hemodynamically stable group.

        "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed in relation to its role in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, which is crucial for regulating vascular resistance and blood pressure. The study indicates that while ADMA levels did not significantly differ between patients with and without intra-dialytic hypotension, the overall dynamics of NO and other related factors like endothelin-1 (ET-1) are implicated in the development of hypotension during hemodialysis. This suggests a complex interplay where ADMA may influence hypotension indirectly through its effects on NO synthesis.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ADMA is linked to nitric oxide synthesis, which is crucial for blood pressure regulation. However, the lack of significant differences in ADMA levels between groups limits the strength of the relationship with hypotension during hemodialysis.",
