    "context": "CO2 vasoreactivity of the cerebral vasculature is impaired in patients with endothelial dysfunction and may serve as a surrogate of cerebrovascular endothelial function (Lavi et al., 2006). Because ADMA is produced in relatively high amounts in the brain, it may be an important endogenous modulator of cerebral vasculature tone under resting conditions and in response to vasoreactive stimuli, including hypercapnia (Faraci et al., 1995). Our present study reveals decreased levels of basal flow velocity in both MCA and an inappropriate increase in MFV during hypercapnia induced by the BHT in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM, as described previously (Petrica et al., 2009; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011). The BHI in the MCA correlated with ADMA, thus confirming the involvement of ADMA in impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilatation of cerebral vessels during hypercapnia. In addition, the BHI correlated with DM duration, HbA1c, plasma ADMA, plasma AGE, hsCRP, cystatin C, and eGFR, which is in agreement with previous results in patients with type 2 DM (F\u00fclesdi et al., 1999; Petrica, Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2007; Petrica et al., 2009; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011). Although impaired CVR has been described in patients with DN and type 1 DM (Kozera et al., 2009) and type 2 DM (Petrica, Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2007), in our study impaired CVR occurred even in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM, thus showing that endothelial response in cerebral vessels changes early in the course of DM, as compared to the response of the glomerular endothelium (Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011). In our study, plasma AGE were increased in patients with CVR impairment, even in the normoalbuminuria stage. ",

        "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is highlighted as a significant endogenous modulator of cerebral vasculature tone, particularly in patients with endothelial dysfunction. The study indicates that elevated levels of ADMA correlate with impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation in cerebral vessels during hypercapnia, suggesting a direct relationship between ADMA and vasodilation disorders, especially in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ADMA and vasodilation disorders, supported by evidence of correlation with impaired endothelial function and specific patient conditions. The context provides quantitative data linking ADMA levels to vasodilation impairment, indicating a significant relationship.",
