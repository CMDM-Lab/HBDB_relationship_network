    "context": "Circulating ADMA is elevated in patients with overt DN, even when the GFR is still within normal range (Hanai et al., 2009). It has been stated that in both normo- and microalbuminuric diabetic patients, plasma ADMA levels have prognostic implications for the transition to a more advanced stage of albuminuria (Krzyzanowska et al., 2007). In our study, ADMA levels were increased in a small number of the normoalbuminuric patients and did not correlate with UACR. Plasma ADMA correlated with inflammation, plasma AGE, serum cystatin C, eGFR, and DM duration. These results revealed in our normoalbuminuric patients are close to the data found in microalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM (Shibata et al., 2009), thus giving rise to the speculation that an inflammatory state at the glomerular level may be found in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM. This inflammatory state could represent a stage of endothelial impairment preceding the expression of glomerular endothelial dysfunction. In previous studies we demonstrated that in early DN, PT dysfunction precedes glomerular endothelial dysfunction, and could explain the steady decline in renal function (as assessed by cystatin C and eGFR) in type 2 DM patients while remaining normoalbuminuric.

        "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is associated with inflammation in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Elevated plasma ADMA levels correlate with inflammatory markers and suggest an inflammatory state at the glomerular level, potentially indicating early endothelial impairment in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetes patients. This relationship highlights ADMA's role as a prognostic marker for renal function decline linked to inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ADMA and inflammation, supported by correlational data indicating that elevated ADMA levels are associated with inflammatory states in diabetic patients. This suggests a critical role of ADMA in the pathophysiology of inflammation related to renal impairment.",
