    "context": "It has been demonstrated that NO is a critical regulator of brain perfusion, a fact supported by the presence of NO-synthase in the brain and cerebral arteries (Iadecola et al., 1994). Long-term DM is associated with endothelial dysfunction, which results in a decreased release of endothelial NO and consequently affects the ability of cerebral vessels to relax efficiently (Faraci et al., 1995; Lavi, Gaitini, Milloul, & Jacob, 2006; Oizumi et al., 2006). CO2 vasoreactivity of the cerebral vasculature is impaired in patients with endothelial dysfunction and may serve as a surrogate of cerebrovascular endothelial function (Lavi et al., 2006). Because ADMA is produced in relatively high amounts in the brain, it may be an important endogenous modulator of cerebral vasculature tone under resting conditions and in response to vasoreactive stimuli, including hypercapnia (Faraci et al., 1995). Our present study reveals decreased levels of basal flow velocity in both MCA and an inappropriate increase in MFV during hypercapnia induced by the BHT in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM, as described previously (Petrica et al., 2009; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011). The BHI in the MCA correlated with ADMA, thus confirming the involvement of ADMA in impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilatation of cerebral vessels during hypercapnia. In addition, the BHI correlated with DM duration, HbA1c, plasma ADMA, plasma AGE, hsCRP, cystatin C, and eGFR, which is in agreement with previous results in patients with type 2 DM (F\u00fclesdi et al., 1999; Petrica, Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2007; Petrica et al., 2009; Petrica, Petrica, et al., 2011; Petrica, Vlad, et al., 2011).

        "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed as an endogenous modulator of cerebral vascular tone, particularly in response to vasoreactive stimuli such as hypercapnia. The study indicates that ADMA levels correlate with impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation during these stimuli, suggesting its role in regulating cerebral blood flow under conditions of increased carbon dioxide. Thus, ADMA's relationship with stimuli is significant in understanding its impact on cerebral perfusion, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ADMA and vasoreactive stimuli, as the context provides evidence of ADMA's role in modulating cerebral vascular responses to hypercapnia, indicating a clear physiological relationship.",
