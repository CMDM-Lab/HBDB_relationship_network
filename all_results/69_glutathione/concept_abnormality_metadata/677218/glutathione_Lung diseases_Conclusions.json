    "context": "The developed CE method is characterized by short separation time (<3min) and high sensitivity (LOD 0.18nM) and is suitable for analysis of low concentrations of GSH in EBC samples. To the best of our knowledge this is the first CE\u2013LIF method in which GSH in EBC was analyzed. The method is applicable also for other types of samples (saliva). A larger study in cooperation with department of pulmonary diseases and tuberculosis at Brno Faculty Hospital to evaluate the GSH levels in EBC of patients with various pulmonary diseases is currently underway. [1] Protectins are newly identified natural chemical mediators that counter leukocyte activation to promote resolution of inflammation. [2] In this study, we provide the first evidence for protectin D1 (PD1, 10R,17S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid) formation from docosahexaenoic acid in human asthma in vivo and PD1 counterregulatory actions in allergic airway inflammation. [3] PD1 and 17S-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid were present in exhaled breath condensates from healthy subjects. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensates (EBC) from patients with various pulmonary diseases, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for lung health. The study aims to evaluate GSH levels in patients with lung diseases, suggesting a significant relationship between glutathione and respiratory conditions, particularly in the context of inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between glutathione and lung diseases, as the study focuses on measuring GSH levels in patients with pulmonary conditions, indicating its relevance in assessing lung health and inflammation.",
        "score": 4
