    "context": "The developed CE method is characterized by short separation time (<3min) and high sensitivity (LOD 0.18nM) and is suitable for analysis of low concentrations of GSH in EBC samples. To the best of our knowledge this is the first CE\u2013LIF method in which GSH in EBC was analyzed. The method is applicable also for other types of samples (saliva). A larger study in cooperation with department of pulmonary diseases and tuberculosis at Brno Faculty Hospital to evaluate the GSH levels in EBC of patients with various pulmonary diseases is currently underway. [1] Protectins are newly identified natural chemical mediators that counter leukocyte activation to promote resolution of inflammation. [2] In this study, we provide the first evidence for protectin D1 (PD1, 10R,17S-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z,11E,13E,15Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid) formation from docosahexaenoic acid in human asthma in vivo and PD1 counterregulatory actions in allergic airway inflammation. [3] PD1 and 17S-hydroxy-docosahexaenoic acid were present in exhaled breath condensates from healthy subjects. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensates (EBC) of patients with various pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. The study aims to evaluate GSH levels, which are important for antioxidant defense and may play a role in the inflammatory response associated with tuberculosis. However, the specific relationship between GSH and tuberculosis is not detailed, indicating a potential area of investigation rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as glutathione is being studied in the context of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis, suggesting a potential link. However, the relationship is not explicitly defined or supported by strong evidence in the provided context.",
        "score": 3
