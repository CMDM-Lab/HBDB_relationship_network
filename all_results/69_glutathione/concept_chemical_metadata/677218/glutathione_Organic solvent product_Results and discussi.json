    "context": "A large variation (as high as 50%) in the biological replicates was observed, but such variation is typical for the analysis of EBC samples in general. The developed method has an importance for other types of samples as well. For instance, although the concentration of GSH in saliva and blood serum/plasma samples is in the \u03bcM range, such samples cannot be directly injected into CE. The protein precipitation by acidification or addition of organic solvents, and subsequent readjustments of pH has been shown to significantly influence the measured GSH content. We have shown that the detrimental effect of proteins on the CE separation and capillary fouling can be reduced by significant dilution of the blood serum samples prior CE analysis. The dilution factors of 25:1 to 100:1 are typically used. This in turn requires about 25\u2013100-fold increase in the sensitivity of the analytical method that can be reached by the developed CE\u2013LIF method. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its measurement in biological samples, particularly in the presence of organic solvents. The method developed for capillary electrophoresis (CE) highlights how organic solvents can influence the protein precipitation process, which in turn affects the accurate measurement of GSH levels. While organic solvents are used to facilitate the analysis, the relationship is more about the methodological challenges rather than a direct biochemical interaction between glutathione and organic solvent products.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as glutathione is involved in the analytical process that utilizes organic solvents, but the context does not establish a significant biochemical relationship between them beyond methodological implications.",
