    "context": "Not so much for capillary electrophoresis (CE) that is less prone to matrix effects, has high resolution and is amenable for low sample volumes (advantageous for most biological samples). The low sensitivity of UV [24\u201326] and conductivity detection in GSH analysis, however, applies also for CE. Use of electrochemical detection methods has also been reported for analysis of GSH and related compounds, but laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection is much more widespread in CE, because very low LODs can be achieved. Numerous CE methods have been reported for determination of GSH in biological samples after derivatization with monobromobimane, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein [32\u201337], 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein [38\u201340], 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxaldehyde [41\u201345], 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, 5-bromomethylfluorescein, fluorescein-5-maleimide, 4-(aminosulfonyl)-7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole, and o-phthaldialdehyde. Majority of the CE\u2013LIF methods have been developed for Ar-ion lasers and excitation wavelength of 488nm with commercially available CE\u2013LIF instruments (Beckmann Coulter Inc., CA, USA) or CE detectors (Picometrics Technologies SAS, Toulouse, France). CE\u2013LIF can benefit from latest technological advances, as many off-the-shelf laser modules with various wavelengths are available. Semiconductor lasers emitting at wavelengths in the visible range (for instance 515, 520, 532, 635nm, etc.) are becoming widely available, they are inexpensive, durable, small in size, and operate at low voltages.
