        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is mentioned in relation to its sulfur atom and its interaction with the NBDHEX molecule. Carbon is referenced in the context of the molecular structure, specifically in the depiction of GSH and its active site architecture. However, there is no direct discussion of the functional relationship between glutathione and carbon beyond their presence in the molecular structure, indicating a lack of significant interaction or relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as glutathione and carbon are both part of the molecular structure discussed, but their relationship is not elaborated upon in terms of function or interaction.",
