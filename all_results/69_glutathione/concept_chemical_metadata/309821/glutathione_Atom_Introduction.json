        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its sulfur atom, which is highlighted for its electron density and conformation. The focus is on the structural aspects of GSH, particularly the sulfur atom's role in the active site architecture. However, the relationship is primarily structural and does not delve into broader biochemical implications or interactions involving glutathione beyond its atomic representation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as glutathione is mentioned in the context of its sulfur atom's conformation, but there is no detailed discussion of its biochemical significance or interactions with other molecules.",
