    "context": "[2] The rms deviation among equivalent atoms of the two NBDHEX benzoxadiazole rings is 4.25 \u00c3\u2026 in the superimposed structures, and a major shift plus a rotation are required to superpose the free NBDHEX of GSTP1-1 to the one covalently bound to GSH in the GSTM2-2 \u00cf\u0192-complex (\n\nFig. 3C). [3] This movement, however, is unrealistic because the hydrophobic side chain of Ile104 is only 3.4 \u00c3\u2026 apart from the benzoxadiazole nitro group in the GSTP1-1 complex and provides steric hindrance (\n\nFigs. 1B and \n\n3C). [4] Taken together, our data suggests that the GSH/NBDHEX \u00cf\u0192-complex in the GSTP1-1 structure would occupy a different position from the one experimentally observed in the GSTM2-2 cocrystal. [5] This is confirmed by the observation that a simple rotation of the GSH cysteine side chain in GSTP1-1 is sufficient to place the sulfur atom in a position competent for addition to the benzoxadiazole C4 (\n\nFig. 1B). [1] A Ile104Val allelic variation of GSTP1-1 increases the isozyme's affinity for NBDHEX. [2] Residue Ile104 of GSTP1-1 faces the benzoxadiazole nitro group and constitutes a physical obstacle to its movement towards the positive charges at the H-site bottom (\n\nFigs. 1C and \n\n3C). [3] This finding immediately captured our attention because mutation of Ile104 into valine is a common polymorphism of human GSTP1-1 and is frequent in tumors . ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its interaction with the GSTP1-1 enzyme and the NBDHEX compound. The sulfur atom of the cysteine side chain in GSH is positioned to facilitate a reaction with the benzoxadiazole C4 group. However, the term 'Atom' is mentioned in a general sense, referring to the sulfur atom specifically, without establishing a broader or significant relationship with glutathione beyond this specific interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as glutathione is involved in a specific reaction where its sulfur atom is relevant, but the relationship lacks broader significance or detailed exploration in the context provided.",
