    "context": "The best retardation effect was obtained by applying alternate on-line dynamic infiltration and static mode infiltration. This can effectively bring a growing fatigue crack to arrest in a short growth increment even at a loading frequency of 10 Hz. Reduced glutathione (GSH) is a major tripeptide occurring in animal and human tissues and fluids. The biologically active site of GSH is represented by the reactive thiol group of the cysteine residue, which is highly nucleophilic and facilitates the role of GSH as a free radical scavenger both under normal physiological conditions and in deactivation and elimination of xenobiotics. By reacting with radicals and oxygen-reactive species, it fulfills a major role in protecting the cells and tissue structures. GSH is believed to be involved in various diseases, such as atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or adult respiratory distress syndrome, in which its normal concentration usually decreases and on the other hand the concentration of the oxidized form (GSSG) increases. The concentration of GSH in biological fluids covers several orders of magnitude, typically from nM to mM. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is highlighted as a crucial tripeptide that functions as a free radical scavenger, protecting cells and tissues from oxidative damage. Its reactive thiol group allows GSH to react with free radicals and reactive oxygen species, playing a significant role in cellular defense mechanisms. The text emphasizes GSH's importance in maintaining normal physiological conditions and its involvement in various diseases where its levels are altered.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between glutathione and free radical scavengers, as GSH is explicitly described as a major free radical scavenger with significant protective roles in biological systems.",
        "score": 5
