    "context": "Therefore, mainly fluorescence detection has been used in the analysis of GSH by HPLC and other separation techniques, such as CE. Sample preparation is often mentioned as one of the most critical steps in the GSH determination because GSH is easily oxidized during the sample preparation. For instance in the analysis of blood samples, the most important source of artifacts associated with sample preparation that may influence the results of GSH and GSSG assays is the hemolysis of the red blood cells and improper sample storage. Hemolysis can cause either overestimation of GSH in the plasma because the GSH level in erythrocytes is about 500-fold higher than that in plasma, or, without refrigeration, lead to the underestimation of GSH and overestimation of GSSG when autoxidation and proteolysis of GSH in the plasma are not repressed [18\u201320]. The protein removal prior to the analysis by acidification or by addition of an organic solvent, such as ACN, acetone, or methanol, can also cause autoxidation of GSH, unless the thiol group is protected. Rossi et al. revealed that the restoration of neutral\u2013alkaline pH in acidified samples also leads to a rapid decrease of thiol concentration if no previous treatment with thiol-masking agents has been performed. The use of filters excluding macromolecules on the basis of their pore dimensions is an alternative method to remove proteins, but large volume of sample is required. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its stability during sample preparation for analysis, particularly highlighting the impact of proteolysis. The text indicates that proteolysis can lead to the degradation of GSH in plasma samples, affecting the accuracy of GSH and GSSG assays. This suggests a significant relationship where proteolysis can influence the measurement and interpretation of glutathione levels in biological samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between glutathione and proteolysis, as the context discusses how proteolysis can affect the stability and measurement of glutathione, indicating a clear relationship in the context of biochemical analysis.",
