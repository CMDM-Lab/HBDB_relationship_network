    "context": "Therefore, mainly fluorescence detection has been used in the analysis of GSH by HPLC and other separation techniques, such as CE. Sample preparation is often mentioned as one of the most critical steps in the GSH determination because GSH is easily oxidized during the sample preparation. For instance in the analysis of blood samples, the most important source of artifacts associated with sample preparation that may influence the results of GSH and GSSG assays is the hemolysis of the red blood cells and improper sample storage. Hemolysis can cause either overestimation of GSH in the plasma because the GSH level in erythrocytes is about 500-fold higher than that in plasma, or, without refrigeration, lead to the underestimation of GSH and overestimation of GSSG when autoxidation and proteolysis of GSH in the plasma are not repressed [18\u201320]. The protein removal prior to the analysis by acidification or by addition of an organic solvent, such as ACN, acetone, or methanol, can also cause autoxidation of GSH, unless the thiol group is protected. Rossi et al. revealed that the restoration of neutral\u2013alkaline pH in acidified samples also leads to a rapid decrease of thiol concentration if no previous treatment with thiol-masking agents has been performed. The use of filters excluding macromolecules on the basis of their pore dimensions is an alternative method to remove proteins, but large volume of sample is required. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) and hemolysis are related through the analysis of blood samples where hemolysis can significantly affect GSH measurement. Hemolysis can lead to an overestimation of GSH levels in plasma due to the high concentration of GSH in erythrocytes, complicating accurate assessments of oxidative stress and redox status. Proper sample handling is crucial to avoid these artifacts.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between glutathione and hemolysis, as hemolysis directly impacts the accuracy of GSH measurements in blood samples. The context provides evidence of how hemolysis can alter GSH levels, indicating a clear relationship in biochemical analysis.",
