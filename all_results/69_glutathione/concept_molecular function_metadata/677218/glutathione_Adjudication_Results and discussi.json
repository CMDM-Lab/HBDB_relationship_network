    "context": "We have shown that the detrimental effect of proteins on the CE separation and capillary fouling can be reduced by significant dilution of the blood serum samples prior CE analysis. The dilution factors of 25:1 to 100:1 are typically used. This in turn requires about 25\u2013100-fold increase in the sensitivity of the analytical method that can be reached by the developed CE\u2013LIF method. In an example on Fig. 5 , a separation and determination of GSH in saliva sample diluted 25:1 without and with standard addition is shown. Note that there is still a significant matrix effect of the saliva sample and slight shifts in migration time of the analyte and the reagent peaks were observed. A thorough study will be required to assess the suitability of the developed method for this kind of sample, and therefore, the content of GSH in saliva was not quantified. The estimate concentration in the original saliva sample was approximately 14\u03bcM. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is mentioned in relation to its analysis in saliva samples using a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method. However, there is no direct connection to 'Adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. The mention of GSH does not imply any evaluative or decision-making process related to adjudication, indicating a lack of relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as glutathione is discussed in the context of analytical methods without any connection to adjudication, which is unrelated to the biochemical analysis presented.",
