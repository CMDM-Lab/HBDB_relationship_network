    "context": "Semiconductor lasers emitting at wavelengths in the visible range (for instance 515, 520, 532, 635nm, etc.) are becoming widely available, they are inexpensive, durable, small in size, and operate at low voltages. More flexible choice of excitation wavelength allows better matching to absorption maxima of existing and newly synthesized fluorescent tags. Higher laser wavelengths are beneficial in analysis of biological samples due to the potential lower fluorescence interference of the unwanted matrix compounds. In this article, we describe the use of 515nm green laser module and CE\u2013LIF for sensitive determination of GSH in various biological samples: exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and saliva. Eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) is used as a fluorescent tag for GSH derivatization. This novel reagent that has not been previously used in CE\u2013LIF studies of GSH has a maximum of the excitation spectra exactly at 515nm matching the employed laser module, and thus, yielding limits of detection in the subnanomolar range. We demonstrate, for the first time, that GSH can be quantified in as little as 20\u03bcl of EBC sample. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed using a 515nm green laser module for sensitive determination in biological samples like exhaled breath condensate and saliva. However, the term 'Adjudication' is not directly related to the analysis or measurement of GSH, indicating no significant connection between the two terms in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between glutathione and adjudication, as adjudication is not discussed or connected to the analysis of GSH in the provided context.",
