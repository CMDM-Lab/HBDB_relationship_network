    "context": "[4] The quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein (excitation at 295 nm and emission at 340 nm) was measured in a single photon counting spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer LS50B) at 25\u00c2\u00b0C after the addition of variable amounts of NBDHEX to 4 \u00ce\u00bcmol/L GST in 0.1 mol/L of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), containing 1 mmol/L of GSH. [5] Fluorescence data were corrected for inner filter effects and fitted to Eq. A, which yields the apparent dissociation constant (KD) for the NBDHEX bound to GST,where \u00ce\u201dF is the protein fluorescence change observed in the presence of a given amount of NBDHEX, \u00ce\u201dFmax is the maximum fluorescence change observed at saturating NBDHEX concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient. [1] Spectrophotometric analysis. [2] The interaction of NBDHEX with GSTs and GSH was analyzed as previously reported . [3] The UV-visible spectrum of NBDHEX (50 \u00ce\u00bcmol/L) in 0.1 mol/L of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), containing 1 mmol/L of GSH was recorded at 25\u00c2\u00b0C before and after the addition of GSTP1-1/Ile104, GSTP1-1/Val104, or GSTP1-1/Ala104 (100 \u00ce\u00bcmol/L). [1] Structure of the GSTP1-1/GSH/NBDHEX complex. [2] We obtained the crystal structure of the GSTP1-1/GSH/NBDHEX complex at 1.55 \u00c3\u2026 resolution from a crystal that was grown in the presence of protein and GSH only, and subsequently soaked with NBDHEX, because cocrystallization experiments with both NBDHEX and GSH did not lead to well-diffracting crystals.

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is involved in the analysis of drug interactions, specifically with the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST). The study examines how NBDHEX interacts with GST in the presence of GSH, indicating that glutathione plays a crucial role in mediating the binding and activity of drugs like NBDHEX. This suggests that GSH is significant in understanding drug interactions, particularly in the context of detoxification and metabolism.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between glutathione and drug interactions, as GSH is directly involved in the binding and activity of the drug NBDHEX through GST. The context provides evidence of this interaction, highlighting the importance of GSH in drug metabolism.",
        "score": 4
