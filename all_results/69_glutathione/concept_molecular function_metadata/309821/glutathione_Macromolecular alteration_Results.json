    "context": "[2] This finding prompted us to exclude the presence of a GSH/NBDHEX \u00cf\u0192-complex in this crystal (\n\nFig. 1B). [3] Therefore, in our structure, we observe a bound but not conjugated NBDHEX. [4] This was quite surprising because the formation of a GSH/NBDHEX \u00cf\u0192-complex in the GSTP1-1 active site can be easily monitored in solution by absorption spectra . [5] However, it was previously suggested by kinetic studies that, in the reaction between GSH and either CDNB  or 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl; ref. \n\n), a physical event, i.e., a conformational change in GSTP1-1 structure, follows the binding of the substrates and is crucial for the \u00cf\u0192-complex formation. [6] This conformational transition is strongly dependent on diffusion-controlled motion of active site regions. [7] Because NBDHEX retains the same benzoxadiazole ring as NBD-Cl, a similar conformational change might also be necessary in this case to enable the \u00cf\u0192-complex formation, and this might be prevented by a lack of structural flexibility in the crystalline environment. [1] Nonetheless, the position of NBDHEX with respect to GSH is very interesting. ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its interaction with NBDHEX and the formation of a \u00cf\u0192-complex within the GSTP1-1 enzyme. The study highlights that a conformational change in the enzyme's structure, which is a macromolecular alteration, is essential for the binding and complex formation with GSH. This suggests that the flexibility and structural dynamics of macromolecules are crucial for the biochemical interactions involving glutathione.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between glutathione and macromolecular alteration, as the context discusses how conformational changes in the GSTP1-1 enzyme are necessary for GSH's interaction, indicating a clear relationship supported by biochemical evidence.",
