    "context": "[6] This conformational transition is strongly dependent on diffusion-controlled motion of active site regions. [7] Because NBDHEX retains the same benzoxadiazole ring as NBD-Cl, a similar conformational change might also be necessary in this case to enable the \u00cf\u0192-complex formation, and this might be prevented by a lack of structural flexibility in the crystalline environment. [1] Nonetheless, the position of NBDHEX with respect to GSH is very interesting. [2] In fact, it has been hypothesized, on the basis of kinetics data, that the formation of the \u00cf\u0192-complex, in which the GSH sulfur is bound to the benzoxadiazole C4 (the same carbon that binds the 6-mercapto-hexanol moiety sulfur) is the rate-limiting step of a reaction that first involves the nucleophilic addition of the GSH sulfur to the C6 atom of the benzoxadiazole ring; this covalent complex then evolves to the more stable \u00cf\u0192-complex (\n\nFig. 1A; ref. \n\n). [3] Indeed, in our structure, we observe that the GSH sulfur adopts two distinct conformations (\n\nFig. 1B). [4] In the main one, which accounts for 75% of total occupancy, the GSH sulfur is at 3.1 \u00c3\u2026 distance from the NBDHEX C6, whereas it is at 4.9 \u00c3\u2026 distance from the C4. [5] In the second conformation, which accounts for the remaining 25% of occupancy, the GSH sulfur is closer to the NBDHEX C4 (3.1 \u00c3\u2026). ",

        "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is directly involved in a nucleophilic addition reaction with the benzoxadiazole compound NBDHEX. The formation of a covalent complex, where the sulfur atom of GSH adds to a specific carbon atom of the benzoxadiazole ring, is identified as the rate-limiting step in the reaction. This highlights the critical role of GSH as a nucleophile in the reaction mechanism, emphasizing its importance in biochemical processes involving nucleophilic addition.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between glutathione and nucleophilic addition, as GSH is explicitly described as participating in a nucleophilic addition reaction, forming a significant covalent complex with NBDHEX, which is central to the reaction's mechanism.",
