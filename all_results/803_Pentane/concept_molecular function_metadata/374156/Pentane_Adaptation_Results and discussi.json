    "context": "The mineralization result lays within the range of what was found in Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al. (2011a) for the elimination of n-hexane in a biofilter inoculated with Fusarium solani during the growth period of biomass, from their results, a 70% n-hexane mineralization can be calculated.Continuous culture operation The three bioreactors showed a very reproducible performance in terms of n-pentane removal and CO2 production. The three bioreactors reached an EC of 250(\u00b120) g m\u22123\u00a0h\u22121 by the second day of operation, rapidly increasing up to an EC of 650(\u00b150) g m\u22123\u00a0h\u22121 after 11 days of operation (Fig.\u00a03b). This rapid increase in EC was likely due to the previous adaptation of the fungal biomass to the biodegradation of n-pentane and to the high density of the aerial biomass present in the bioreactors. Biomass increases only 2\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121 from the onset of the continuous gas fed, reaching 89.3(\u00b13.5) g L\u22121 dry support. This low growth is a consequence of the limited amount of nutrients supplied at the end of the batch culture, a condition purposely selected to promote carbon mineralization rather than its incorporation to biomass.

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is linked to the adaptation of fungal biomass in a biofilter system for its biodegradation. The study indicates that the fungal biomass adapted to effectively remove n-pentane, as evidenced by a significant increase in elimination capacity (EC) over time. This adaptation is crucial for optimizing the biodegradation process, highlighting the relationship between pentane and the biological adaptation of the microorganisms involved.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between pentane and adaptation, as the context provides evidence of the fungal biomass's adaptation leading to improved biodegradation performance. The quantitative data on elimination capacity supports this relationship, indicating a clear interaction.",
