    "context": "Counting considered the cells present in the four corner squares plus the centre one. Cell mean values were calculated and expressed in number of cells per ml. Working with totally artificial culture media starting with double distilled water and culture grade of chemicals ruled out the presence of VOCs which may have been present in natural seawater solutions and their concentrated homologues.Determination of volatile organic compounds Standard preparation. A compressed gas mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane (Scotty II mixture, Alltech, CA, USA) was used as a primary standard. A secondary standard was prepared by passing the outlet pipe into a vial containing 5 ml of double distilled water and incubated at 40 \u00b0C. A gas sample of 100 \u03bcl was taken from the head space with a gas tight syringe and analysed by GC-FID. The results were processed by Varian Star 5.31 software. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as part of a compressed gas mixture used as a primary standard for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The term 'pentane' appears twice, indicating it is the same compound being referenced. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or interactions within the study, merely its inclusion in a standard preparation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 'Pentane' and 'pentane' refer to the same chemical compound without any additional context or interaction described. They are mentioned coincidentally in the context of a standard preparation.",
