    "context": "Counting considered the cells present in the four corner squares plus the centre one. Cell mean values were calculated and expressed in number of cells per ml. Working with totally artificial culture media starting with double distilled water and culture grade of chemicals ruled out the presence of VOCs which may have been present in natural seawater solutions and their concentrated homologues.Determination of volatile organic compounds Standard preparation. A compressed gas mixture of methane, ethane, propane, butane and pentane (Scotty II mixture, Alltech, CA, USA) was used as a primary standard. A secondary standard was prepared by passing the outlet pipe into a vial containing 5 ml of double distilled water and incubated at 40 \u00b0C. A gas sample of 100 \u03bcl was taken from the head space with a gas tight syringe and analysed by GC-FID. The results were processed by Varian Star 5.31 software. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane and propane are both mentioned as components of a compressed gas mixture used as a primary standard for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are part of a standard preparation process involving gas chromatography analysis. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their inclusion in the same gas mixture.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as pentane and propane are connected through their presence in a gas mixture for analytical purposes, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed in the context.",
