    "context": "[3] Concentrations of 8-isoprostane are increased in expired condensates of patients with asthma and its level correlates with disease severity and exhaled CO level . [4] Levels of 8-isoprostane are also increased in cigarette smokers, in patients with COPD and in CF . [1] The volatile gases, ethane and pentane, can also be detected in the breath and have been used to measure lipid peroxidation to reflect oxidative stress. [2] Exhaled pentane is increased during asthma exacerbations and decreases during recovery . [3] Exhaled ethane level is increased in cigarette smokers  and is reduced by high doses of antioxidant vitamins C and E, but not by vitamin E alone , . [4] Exhaled ethane levels are increased in CF and COPD, where there is a correlation with disease severity and with other markers of oxidative stress, such as exhaled CO. [5] Exhaled ethane is also increased in asthma, and the levels are lower in patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids . ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as a volatile gas detected in the breath, used to measure lipid peroxidation and reflect oxidative stress. The text indicates that exhaled pentane levels increase during asthma exacerbations and decrease during recovery, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress in respiratory conditions. However, the relationship is primarily observational without detailed mechanistic insights.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as pentane is discussed in relation to its role in measuring oxidative stress in respiratory diseases, indicating some significance in the context of asthma and other conditions, but lacking deeper exploration of its biochemical interactions.",
        "score": 3
