    "context": "Removal of the aerial biomass in the FB decreases the EC up to 3.4 times. The mathematical model proposed herein closely follows the experimental values, as long as in the stage without aerial biomass the partition coefficient is assumed to be equal to the one used in a bacterial biofilter. The largest EC value of the FB inoculated with filamentous fungi can be explained by the existence of a greater transport surface area as a result of the aerial growth and the greater solubility of the hydrophobic VOCs, given by a smaller partition coefficient. The configuration of FB used in this work promotes the growth of aerial biomass to a larger extent when compared to a conventional packed-bed biofilter, thus allowing higher EC for n-pentane, a hydrophobic contaminant. It is commonly known that mould growth in indoor environment can be associated with adverse health effects. Beyond the fact that spores of mould may cause allergies and asthma (Zureik et al., 2002; Benndorf et al., 2008) fungi produce plenty of volatile organic compounds (MVOCs). MVOCs are suspected of being responsible for a wide range of specific and non-specific symptoms and discomfort (Wessen and Schoeps, 1996; Elke et al., 1999). ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as a hydrophobic volatile organic compound (VOC) whose removal efficiency (EC) is influenced by the configuration of a fungal biofilter (FB). The study highlights that the presence of aerial biomass enhances the transport surface area, leading to improved solubility and removal of n-pentane. The relationship emphasizes the role of pentane in the context of biofiltration and its environmental impact, particularly regarding health effects associated with mold growth and MVOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between pentane and its removal efficiency in a biofilter context, supported by experimental observations. The relationship is clear, showing how pentane's properties affect its treatment in biofiltration systems, although it lacks detailed quantitative data.",
