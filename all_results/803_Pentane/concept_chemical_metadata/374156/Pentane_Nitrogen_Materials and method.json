    "context": "Pentane inlet concentration, was set at 1.0(\u00b10.21) g m\u22123, corresponding to an inlet load of 880\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0h\u22121. The results from the continuous n-pentane removal experiments were expressed in terms of CO2 production (P, g m\u22123\u00a0h\u22121) and n-pentane elimination capacity (EC, g m\u22123\u00a0h\u22121) according to: (12) P = Q V r S C O 2 ( o u t ) (13) E C = Q V r ( C A G 0 \u2212 C A G ( o u t ) ) where Q and V r represent the n-pentane polluted air flow and bioreactor volume, respectively, S CO2 the outlet CO2 concentration, and C AGO and C AG(out) the inlet and outlet n-pentane concentrations, respectively.Analytical methods The gas n-pentane and CO2 concentrations were measured in triplicate in a GC-FID and a GC-TCD, respectively (Shimadzu, 2014, Japan) equipped with a capillary column Rtx-5 Restex UE (30\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.32 mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.25\u00a0\u03bcm) and a Carbomex 1000 column. Pentane was determined at a FID detector temperature of 220\u00a0\u00b0C, an injection temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C and a column temperature of 200\u00a0\u00b0C using nitrogen as gas carrier. CO2 was determined at an injection temperature of 65\u00a0\u00b0C, an oven temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C and a TCD detector temperature of 100\u00a0\u00b0C. The fungal biomass in the vermiculite was measured as volatile solids using a thermogravimetric analyzer according to Arriaga and Revah (2005). The total suspended solid concentration in the inoculum was determined in triplicate by taking dry weight measurements at 105\u00a0\u00b0C during 24\u00a0h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is analyzed in terms of its concentration and removal capacity in a bioreactor, while nitrogen is utilized as a carrier gas in the analytical methods for measuring pentane and CO2 concentrations. The relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the role of nitrogen in facilitating the detection of pentane rather than any direct chemical or biological interaction between the two substances.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as pentane and nitrogen are related through the analytical process, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond their roles in the experiment.",
