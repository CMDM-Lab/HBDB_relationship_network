    "context": "[2] The regulation of haemoxygenase-1 and haemoxygenase-2 activity, mechanisms of haemoxygenase-1 induction by inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species, and the multiple effects and role of the end-products of haemoxygenase activity under physiological and pathophysiological conditions were discussed in detail. [3] Table\u00e2\u20ac\u20262\u00e2\u2021\u201c summarizes the references on the most studied exhaled biomarkers in different lung conditions (exhaled nitric oxide is not included). The low solubility of hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in bacterial biofilms, which hinders both their mass transfer and biodegradation, represents one of the main limitations of the performance of gas-phase biofilters (Davison et\u00a0al., 2000; Arriaga and Revah, 2005; Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2006, 2011a). In this context, the use of filamentous fungi as biocatalysts in packed bed biofilters has been consistently shown to reduce these mass transfer limitations during the treatment of n-hexane, n-pentane or methane (Kennes and Veiga, 2004; Lebrero et\u00a0al., 2016; Spigno and De Faveri, 2005; Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2011a). Despite the recent advances conducted in fungal biofiltration over the past decade and the key role of the aerial mycelia on VOC biodegradation, the contribution of fungal hyphae to the enhancement in the abatement of hydrophobic VOCs has not been quantitatively assessed yet. In this context, multiple mathematical models have been developed to describe the higher elimination capacities recorded in fungal biofilters during the abatement of hydrophobic VOCs (Arriaga and Revah, 2009; Spigno et\u00a0al., 2003; Spigno and De Faveri, 2005; Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2008). Conventional fungal biofilter models often describe microbial biofilms as a monolayer (pseudo-homogeneous phase), an approach that might hold for bacteria but that underestimates the contribution of the aerial fungal hyphae to the overall gas-cell mass transfer (Fig.\u00a01 ).

        "summary": "In this context, pentane and methane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are treated in gas-phase biofilters, particularly using filamentous fungi as biocatalysts. The discussion highlights the challenges of mass transfer and biodegradation of hydrophobic VOCs, including pentane and methane, in biofiltration systems. However, the relationship between pentane and methane is not explicitly detailed beyond their shared categorization as VOCs addressed in similar treatment processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as pentane and methane are both identified as VOCs in the context of biofiltration, but their specific interactions or comparative significance are not elaborated upon.",
