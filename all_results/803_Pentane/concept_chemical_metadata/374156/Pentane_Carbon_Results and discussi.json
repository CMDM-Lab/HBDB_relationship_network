    "context": "Even without the contribution of fungal hyphae, flat fungal biofilms supported ECs one order of magnitude larger than the 12\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0h\u22121 reported by Dupasquier et\u00a0al. (2002), during n-pentane biodegradation in a biofilter inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 30\u00a0\u00b0C co-metabolically degrading methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Therefore, based on the low fungal growth during stage II (visual observation), it can be concluded that the aerial biomass was responsible for at least 71.6(\u00b14)% of the EC in the bioreactor during stage I. This finding can be explained by the large surface area provided by the aerial fungal hyphae together with the occurrence of hydrophobic proteins on their surface triggered as a response to the presence of a hydrophobic carbon source such as n-pentane (Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2011a). At the end of the experiment, the biomass present in the solid support (non-aerial biomass) was 60.3(\u00b15.8) gmonolayer biomass L\u22121 dry support. Finally, the mineralization of n-pentane during stage II accounted for 69.2(\u00b17.3)%, ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is identified as a hydrophobic carbon source that is being biodegraded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a biofilter. The study highlights the role of aerial fungal biomass in enhancing the efficiency of pentane degradation, indicating a direct relationship between pentane as a carbon source and the microbial activity involved in its breakdown. The presence of hydrophobic proteins on fungal hyphae is also noted, which are triggered by the hydrophobic nature of pentane, further emphasizing the connection between pentane and carbon in the context of biodegradation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between pentane and carbon, as pentane serves as a hydrophobic carbon source for microbial degradation. The context provides evidence of this relationship through the discussion of biodegradation processes and the role of fungal biomass, indicating a clear interaction.",
