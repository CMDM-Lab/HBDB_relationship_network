    "context": "Finally, considering \u03b1 as the fraction of the total biomass corresponding to the aerial biomass, the superficial area available for n-pentane mass transfer can be defined as: (11) a V = a m + a a \u22c5 \u03b1 Microorganisms and inoculum Fusarium sp. was isolated as described by Arriaga and Revah (2005) and identified as F.\u00a0solani CBS 117476 by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (The Netherlands). Its preservation, cultivation conditions and spore production were similar to that reported by Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1a et\u00a0al. (2001).Carbon source and mineral medium Pentane (Merck, 99%) was used as a model hydrophobic VOC. The mineral salt medium (MSM) used throughout the entire experimentation was prepared in a buffered phosphate solution (pH 4) and contained (g L\u22121): 18 NaNO3; 1.3 KH2PO4; 0.38 MgSO4\u00b77H2O; 0.25 CaSO4\u00b72H2O; 0.055 CaCl2; 0.015 FeSO4\u00b77H2O; 0.012 MnSO4\u00b7H2O; 0.013 ZnSO4\u00b77H2O; 0.0023 CuSO4\u00b77H2O; 0.0015 CoCl2\u00b76H2O; 0.0015H3BO3. The MSM was supplemented in all experiments with gentamicin (40\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121) and chloramphenicol (50\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121) to prevent bacterial growth and favor the fungal population (Arriaga and Revah, 2005). In this way, the study can be focused to the sole contribution of fungi to compound degradation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is utilized as a model hydrophobic volatile organic compound (VOC) in a mineral salt medium (MSM) that contains various minerals essential for microbial growth and degradation processes. The minerals listed, such as NaNO3, MgSO4, and CaSO4, provide necessary nutrients for the fungi involved in the degradation of pentane, indicating a supportive relationship where minerals facilitate the biological activity related to pentane degradation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between pentane and minerals, as the minerals in the MSM are crucial for the microbial processes that degrade pentane. The context provides specific details about the mineral composition and its role in the experiment, indicating a clear relationship.",
