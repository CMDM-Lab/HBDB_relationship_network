    "context": "Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al. (2008) successfully modeled mycelium growth in biofilters treating n-hexane, but this mathematical approach neglected the contribution of the non-aerial biomass. This work aims at developing an innovative experimental methodology to quantify the contribution of the aerial and non-aerial fungal biomass to n-pentane biodegradation. This information was used to construct a predictive mathematical model describing fungal growth and the continuous biodegradation of n-pentane using Fusarium solani as a model fungus. The model was further validated using an independent set of experiments. System definition The mathematical model developed aimed at describing the biodegradation of n-pentane by the filamentous fungus Fusarium solani and to quantify, for the first time, the contribution of the aerial and non-aerial biofilm. For this purpose, both the mass transfer of n-pentane from the bulk gas to the biomass and the biological consumption of this VOC by the fungal biomass were considered. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is specifically referred to as n-pentane, which is the target compound for biodegradation by the filamentous fungus Fusarium solani. The study focuses on modeling the growth of mycelium and quantifying the contributions of both aerial and non-aerial fungal biomass in the biodegradation process of n-pentane. The relationship is clear as the research aims to understand how effectively this fungus can degrade n-pentane, highlighting its significance in bioremediation efforts.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between pentane and n-pentane, as the study is centered on the biodegradation of n-pentane by a specific fungus, indicating a strong relevance in the context of biochemistry and environmental science.",
        "score": 5
