    "context": "3.2\u00a0g of dry solid media were confined in wire-mesh boxes made of stainless steel 316 (dimension 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.5\u00a0cm) located in the center of the bioreactor (Fig.\u00a02 ). Vermiculite exhibited a particle size distribution between 4.8 and 3.4\u00a0mm, with a water retention capacity of 68(\u00b15) %, initial pH of 4.29(\u00b11.1) and a bed porosity of 60(\u00b15) %. In order to validate the assumption of negligible n-pentane adsorption on vermiculite (assumption 3 in the Mathematical Model section), an n-pentane adsorption isotherm was experimentally determined by contacting a known mass of vermiculite with gas with a known n-pentane concentration in a tight gas container for a period of 24\u00a0h, enough to reach equilibrium at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. The amount of n-pentane adsorbed was calculated as the difference between initial and final n-pentane concentration (measured by gas chromatography, see section Analytical Methods).Experimental fungal bioreactor description Experiments were performed in three 1-L glass gas-tight bioreactors containing 100\u00a0mL of sterile distilled water at the bottom, for moisture control. The wire-mesh boxes containing the solid support were suspended (Fig.\u00a02) inside each reactor. The temperature of the experimental set-up was maintained at 30(\u00b13)\u00b0C using a thermoregulated chamber. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane and vermiculite are related through an experimental setup designed to assess the adsorption characteristics of n-pentane on vermiculite. The study aims to validate the assumption of negligible pentane adsorption by determining the adsorption isotherm, indicating a direct investigation of their interaction in a controlled environment. The results are crucial for understanding the behavior of pentane in relation to vermiculite's properties.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between pentane and vermiculite, as the study provides experimental data on the adsorption behavior of pentane on vermiculite, indicating a clear relationship within the context of adsorption studies.",
