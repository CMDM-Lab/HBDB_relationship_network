The biomass volume (total biomass), V biomass , was obtained from the experimental total dry biomass and its water content (82%, Vergara-Fern\u00e1ndez et\u00a0al., 2006) assuming a biofilm density of 1.0\u00a0g\u00a0cm\u22123 (Deshusses et\u00a0al., 1995). a a was calculated according to Arriaga and Revah (2009) considering the total hyphal length, L hyphae , as follows: (9) L h y p h a e = V b i o m a s s \u03c0 ( d h y p h a e / 2 ) 2 The total fungal interfacial area per reactor volume, a a , can be calculated as: (10) a a = ( d h y p h a e ) ( L h y p h a e ) \u03c0 V r e a c t o r On the other hand, the surface area corresponding to nonaerial biomass was approximated to the surface area available from the porous support (not a function of the generated aerial biomass), since only the outer biomass of the monolayer is available for transport. Finally, considering \u03b1 as the fraction of the total biomass corresponding to the aerial biomass, the superficial area available for n-pentane mass transfer can be defined as: (11) a V = a m + a a \u22c5 \u03b1 Microorganisms and inoculum Fusarium sp. was isolated as described by Arriaga and Revah (2005) and identified as F.\u00a0solani CBS 117476 by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (The Netherlands). Its preservation, cultivation conditions and spore production were similar to that reported by Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1a et\u00a0al. (2001).Carbon source and mineral medium Pentane (Merck, 99%) was used as a model hydrophobic VOC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as a model hydrophobic volatile organic compound (VOC) used in experiments involving the biomass of Fusarium sp. The term 'Pentane' and 'pentane' refer to the same chemical compound, indicating its role in the study. However, there is no additional discussion of its specific interactions or significance beyond its identification as a VOC for mass transfer calculations.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both terms refer to the same compound, but the context does not elaborate on their relationship or specific interactions. They are mentioned in a general sense without detailed discussion.",
