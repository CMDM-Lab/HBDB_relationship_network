    "context": "Vermiculite exhibited a particle size distribution between 4.8 and 3.4\u00a0mm, with a water retention capacity of 68(\u00b15) %, initial pH of 4.29(\u00b11.1) and a bed porosity of 60(\u00b15) %. In order to validate the assumption of negligible n-pentane adsorption on vermiculite (assumption 3 in the Mathematical Model section), an n-pentane adsorption isotherm was experimentally determined by contacting a known mass of vermiculite with gas with a known n-pentane concentration in a tight gas container for a period of 24\u00a0h, enough to reach equilibrium at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. The amount of n-pentane adsorbed was calculated as the difference between initial and final n-pentane concentration (measured by gas chromatography, see section Analytical Methods).Experimental fungal bioreactor description Experiments were performed in three 1-L glass gas-tight bioreactors containing 100\u00a0mL of sterile distilled water at the bottom, for moisture control. The wire-mesh boxes containing the solid support were suspended (Fig.\u00a02) inside each reactor. The temperature of the experimental set-up was maintained at 30(\u00b13)\u00b0C using a thermoregulated chamber. Experiments were performed in triplicate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, pentane and distilled water are mentioned in relation to an experimental setup involving vermiculite and gas adsorption studies. Distilled water is used for moisture control in the bioreactor, while pentane is the volatile organic compound being adsorbed. Their relationship is indirect, as they serve different roles in the experiment\u2014pentane as the adsorbate and distilled water as a medium for maintaining moisture conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as pentane and distilled water are connected through their roles in the experimental setup, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between them.",
