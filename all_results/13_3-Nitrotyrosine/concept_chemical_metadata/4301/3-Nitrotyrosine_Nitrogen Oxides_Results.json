    "context": "A trend towards higher protein levels in subjects with DPT was observed but did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant correlation between EBC protein and lung function, nor with FeNO or eCO in any group. EBC protein levels directly correlated with NOx (r =0.50, p <0.0001), 8-isoprostane and hydrogen peroxide as above. EBC nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 3-nitrotyrosine EBC NOx was measurable in all groups. A trend towards increasing EBC NOx concentrations in patients with DPT and asbestosis compared with normal controls was observed but did not reach statistical significance. EBC levels of NOx did not correlate with 3-nitrotyrosine or hydrogen ion (H+) concentration in EBC. However, NOx correlated directly with protein (r =0.64, p <0.0001), 8-isoprostane (r =0.59, p <0.0001) and H2O2 (r =0.61, p <0.0001) in EBC in all groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are both measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of subjects. While NOx levels correlated significantly with other markers such as protein and 8-isoprostane, there was no direct correlation between NOx and 3-nitrotyrosine levels. This suggests that while both are present in EBC, their relationship is not strongly defined within the study's findings.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both 3-Nitrotyrosine and nitrogen oxides are analyzed in the same context of EBC, but their direct relationship is not established, indicating some level of interaction without strong evidence.",
        "score": 3
