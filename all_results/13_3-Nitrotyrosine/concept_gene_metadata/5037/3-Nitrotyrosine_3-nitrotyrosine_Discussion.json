    "context": "The results for healthy subjects demonstrate the necessity of a highly sensitive method for the determination of nitrotyrosine in EBC. Moreover, these results confirm the problems of the immunochemical technique to generate accurate results, as mentioned by other authors [11,16\u201317]. Due to the proven reliability the new LC\u2013MS/MS method, this is the method of choice for the accurate quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine in EBC. Due to individual day-to-day variance of the parameters, an improved standardization of sampling conditions is recommended if 3-nitrotyrosine should be used for biological monitoring of inflammatory reactions in the airways. Materials and methods Chemicals and reagents Analytical-grade water was supplied by an Elix/Synergy Water Purification System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). High purity grade organic solvents, hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), disodium hydrogenphosphate, Triton X-100, and sodium acetate trihydrate were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. 3-Nitro-l-tyrosine, l-tyrosine (>99%), heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA), trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD, 2.0M in hexane), tetranitromethane (TNM), and pronase (Streptomyces griseus, EC 3.4.24.31) were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine refer to the same compound, with the former being a more formal representation of the name. The text discusses the quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and emphasizes the need for accurate measurement methods. The relationship is purely semantic, as both terms denote the same biochemical marker relevant to inflammatory reactions in the airways.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine, as they are two representations of the same compound, essential for the context of measuring inflammatory markers.",
        "score": 5
