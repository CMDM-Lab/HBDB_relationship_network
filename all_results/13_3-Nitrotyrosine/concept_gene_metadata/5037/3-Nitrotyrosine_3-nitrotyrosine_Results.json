    "context": "On the basis of ISO 11843 the limit of quantification was determined to be 3.9pg/mL for the described procedure and detection system. Table 4 shows the 3-NT concentration found in the EBC of healthy subjects. In 94% of these EBC samples, nitrotyrosine was found to exceed the limit of quantification. No significant difference was found between the nitrotyrosine concentrations in EBC of smokers and non-smokers. The SB Phenyl column was selected as stationary phase for the chromatographic separation of the analyte because of its well-balanced retention abilities for aromatic substances. Thus, the elution of the analytes was performed by a low share of organic solvent and without gradient. As seen in the chromatogram, the signals of 3-NT and internal standards are free of interference. ",
