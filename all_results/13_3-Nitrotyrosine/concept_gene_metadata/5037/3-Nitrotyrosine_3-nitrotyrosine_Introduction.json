    "context": "In subjects with lung diseases free and protein-bonded nitrotyrosine was detected in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue [4\u20137]. First investigations on 3-NT in exhaled breath condensate were performed by the group of Kharitonov and co-workers for smoking and non-smoking healthy subjects, for patients with asthma and patients with cystic fibrosis. Using a specific enzyme immunoassay, they verified a mean 3-NT concentration of 6.3ng/mL in exhaled breath condensates of healthy subjects and significant higher concentrations in patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the studies of L\u00e4rstad et al. and Rothe et al., which were performed with GC\u2013tandem-MS and HPLC\u2013MS techniques, suggested much lower concentrations of free nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate. Our goal was the development of a reliable and sensitive analytical procedure for the quantitative detection of free 3-NT in exhaled breath condensate by using high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Chemicals 3-Nitro-l-tyrosine was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). l-Tyrosine was purchased in biochemical grade from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine refer to the same compound, with the former being a more specific nomenclature. The text discusses its detection in various biological samples, particularly in relation to lung diseases, highlighting its significance as a biomarker. The studies mentioned focus on measuring its concentration in exhaled breath condensate, indicating its relevance in respiratory conditions like cystic fibrosis.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine, as they are essentially the same compound discussed in the context of lung disease biomarkers, with strong contextual support for their relevance.",
        "score": 5
