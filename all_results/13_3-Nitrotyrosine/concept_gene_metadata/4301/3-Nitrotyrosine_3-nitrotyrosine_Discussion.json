    "context": "EBC NOx are in general unstable and have been well documented to be affected by several other factors e.g. oral bacteria, diet, NOx contamination from the collection device. 39,43 3-Nitrotyrosine proved difficult to measure and did not add to our findings. Overall, our results indicate that NOx and 3-nitrotyrosine are currently not useful for assessing asbestos-related disease. The stability and bioactivities of many RNS and ROS are pH dependent, and thus airway pH is likely to be relevant to the effects of asbestos on the lung. Airway pH changes in a variety of different lung diseases including asthma, 32 COPD 44 and also with gastro-oesophageal reflux, 45 but has not been previously assessed in asbestos related disorders. We found that subjects with asbestosis had a significantly lower EBC pH than individuals with DPT, but no differences were observed between other groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine is mentioned as a compound that proved difficult to measure and did not contribute to the findings regarding asbestos-related disease. The text indicates that both 3-Nitrotyrosine and NOx are not useful for assessing such diseases, suggesting a lack of significant relevance or interaction between them in this specific study. The mention of 3-Nitrotyrosine appears to be more about its measurement challenges rather than a direct relationship with the disease or other factors.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine are essentially the same compound, but their mention in the context does not establish any functional or significant relationship. They are referenced in a discussion about measurement difficulties without further exploration of their relevance.",
