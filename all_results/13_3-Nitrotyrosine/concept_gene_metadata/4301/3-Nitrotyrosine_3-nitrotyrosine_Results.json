    "context": "However, NOx correlated directly with protein (r =0.64, p <0.0001), 8-isoprostane (r =0.59, p <0.0001) and H2O2 (r =0.61, p <0.0001) in EBC in all groups. 3-Nitrotyrosine was difficult to detect in EBC of normal subjects. Most of the results were close to the limit of detection of the assay and below this in 20 patients. However, there was no significant difference in EBC 3-nitrotyrosine between normal subjects and patients with asbestos-related diseases, and no significant correlation between 3-nitrotyrosine and either FeNO levels, other EBC biomarkers or lung function. EBC pH (H+ concentration) Subjects with asbestosis had significantly lower EBC pH than individuals with DPT (7.26\u00b10.31 versus 7.53\u00b10.24, p <0.05; Fig.\u00a02B). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine refer to the same compound, indicating a potential issue with nomenclature consistency. The study discusses the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and its correlation with other biomarkers, but does not differentiate between the two terms. The lack of significant findings regarding 3-nitrotyrosine levels in normal subjects versus patients suggests limited relevance in this specific context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine are essentially the same entity, mentioned without any distinct relationship or functional interaction in the context. Their mention does not contribute to a deeper understanding of the study's findings.",
