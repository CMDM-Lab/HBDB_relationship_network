    "context": "The formation of peroxynitrite may be responsible for the cytotoxicity commonly attributed to nitric oxide. Peroxynitrite is considered by some authors to be the major reactive form of NO in vivo, especially under condition of inflammation where the production of oxygen free radicals is prominent. Peroxynitrite, as well as myeloperoxidase generated nitrogen dioxide, reacts with free or protein bond tyrosine residues producing 3-nitro-l-tyrosine (3-NT), a stable end product (Fig. 1 ). In subjects with lung diseases free and protein-bonded nitrotyrosine was detected in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue [4\u20137]. First investigations on 3-NT in exhaled breath condensate were performed by the group of Kharitonov and co-workers for smoking and non-smoking healthy subjects, for patients with asthma and patients with cystic fibrosis. Using a specific enzyme immunoassay, they verified a mean 3-NT concentration of 6.3ng/mL in exhaled breath condensates of healthy subjects and significant higher concentrations in patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the studies of L\u00e4rstad et al. and Rothe et al., which were performed with GC\u2013tandem-MS and HPLC\u2013MS techniques, suggested much lower concentrations of free nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate.

        "summary": "In this context, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) is linked to lung diseases through its formation from the reaction of peroxynitrite with tyrosine residues, particularly under inflammatory conditions. The presence of 3-NT has been detected in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue of subjects with lung diseases, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for inflammation in conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis. Studies have shown significantly higher concentrations of 3-NT in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy individuals, suggesting a direct association between 3-NT levels and lung disease severity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 3-nitrotyrosine and lung diseases, supported by evidence of elevated 3-NT levels in patients with lung conditions. This indicates a clear relationship, particularly in the context of inflammation and potential diagnostic relevance.",
        "score": 4
