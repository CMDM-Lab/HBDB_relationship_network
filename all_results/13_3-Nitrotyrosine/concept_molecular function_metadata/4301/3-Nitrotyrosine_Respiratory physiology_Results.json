    "context": "However, NOx correlated directly with protein (r =0.64, p <0.0001), 8-isoprostane (r =0.59, p <0.0001) and H2O2 (r =0.61, p <0.0001) in EBC in all groups. 3-Nitrotyrosine was difficult to detect in EBC of normal subjects. Most of the results were close to the limit of detection of the assay and below this in 20 patients. However, there was no significant difference in EBC 3-nitrotyrosine between normal subjects and patients with asbestos-related diseases, and no significant correlation between 3-nitrotyrosine and either FeNO levels, other EBC biomarkers or lung function. EBC pH (H+ concentration) Subjects with asbestosis had significantly lower EBC pH than individuals with DPT (7.26\u00b10.31 versus 7.53\u00b10.24, p <0.05; Fig.\u00a02B). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine is mentioned as a biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) related to respiratory physiology. However, the study found no significant differences in 3-Nitrotyrosine levels between normal subjects and patients with asbestos-related diseases, nor any correlation with lung function or other biomarkers. This suggests limited relevance of 3-Nitrotyrosine as a marker in respiratory physiology under the conditions studied.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 3-Nitrotyrosine is discussed in the context of respiratory physiology but lacks significant correlation or impact on lung function or disease markers, indicating a general association without detailed interaction.",
