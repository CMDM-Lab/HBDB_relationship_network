    "context": "The results for healthy subjects demonstrate the necessity of a highly sensitive method for the determination of nitrotyrosine in EBC. Moreover, these results confirm the problems of the immunochemical technique to generate accurate results, as mentioned by other authors [11,16\u201317]. Due to the proven reliability the new LC\u2013MS/MS method, this is the method of choice for the accurate quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine in EBC. Due to individual day-to-day variance of the parameters, an improved standardization of sampling conditions is recommended if 3-nitrotyrosine should be used for biological monitoring of inflammatory reactions in the airways. Materials and methods Chemicals and reagents Analytical-grade water was supplied by an Elix/Synergy Water Purification System (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). High purity grade organic solvents, hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4), disodium hydrogenphosphate, Triton X-100, and sodium acetate trihydrate were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. 3-Nitro-l-tyrosine, l-tyrosine (>99%), heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA), trimethylsilyldiazomethane (TMSD, 2.0M in hexane), tetranitromethane (TNM), and pronase (Streptomyces griseus, EC 3.4.24.31) were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, 3-nitrotyrosine is highlighted as a biomarker for monitoring inflammatory reactions in the airways. The study emphasizes the need for accurate quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine using a reliable LC\u2013MS/MS method, suggesting its relevance in assessing inflammation. Improved standardization of sampling conditions is recommended for effective biological monitoring, indicating a direct link between 3-nitrotyrosine levels and inflammatory processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 3-nitrotyrosine and inflammation, as the context discusses its use as a biomarker for monitoring inflammatory reactions, supported by the need for accurate measurement methods.",
        "score": 4
