    "context": "Because EBC represents a highly diluted matrix, similar or lower concentration should be expected for EBC. On the other hand our NT levels are in agreement with the NT concentration presented by L\u00e4rstadt and co-workers in their presentation. They mentioned a mean value of 149\u00b193pg/mL for four healthy, non-smoking volunteers, which corresponds with the range of our results. In conclusion, the new procedure on the basis of clean-up and preconcentration by SPE, liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was proved to be reliable and sensitive for the determination of free 3-nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate. The results for healthy subjects demonstrate the necessity of a highly sensitive method for the determination of nitrotyrosine in EBC. Moreover, these results confirm the problems of the immunochemical technique to generate accurate results, as mentioned by other authors [11,16\u201317]. Due to the proven reliability the new LC\u2013MS/MS method, this is the method of choice for the accurate quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine in EBC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (NT) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess its concentration levels in healthy individuals. The study emphasizes the importance of a reliable method for accurately quantifying NT in EBC, highlighting the challenges faced by immunochemical techniques. The findings suggest that NT levels in exhaled breath can serve as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress, reinforcing the relevance of exhalation as a medium for measuring this compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 3-Nitrotyrosine and exhalation, as the study focuses on quantifying NT in exhaled breath condensate, providing evidence of its relevance as a biomarker. The methodological advancements discussed further support this relationship.",
