    "context": "In subjects with lung diseases free and protein-bonded nitrotyrosine was detected in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung tissue [4\u20137]. First investigations on 3-NT in exhaled breath condensate were performed by the group of Kharitonov and co-workers for smoking and non-smoking healthy subjects, for patients with asthma and patients with cystic fibrosis. Using a specific enzyme immunoassay, they verified a mean 3-NT concentration of 6.3ng/mL in exhaled breath condensates of healthy subjects and significant higher concentrations in patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the studies of L\u00e4rstad et al. and Rothe et al., which were performed with GC\u2013tandem-MS and HPLC\u2013MS techniques, suggested much lower concentrations of free nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate. Our goal was the development of a reliable and sensitive analytical procedure for the quantitative detection of free 3-NT in exhaled breath condensate by using high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Chemicals 3-Nitro-l-tyrosine was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). l-Tyrosine was purchased in biochemical grade from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) is analyzed as a biomarker in exhaled breath condensate from subjects with lung diseases, including asthma and cystic fibrosis. The studies indicate that 3-NT concentrations are significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy subjects, suggesting a potential link between elevated 3-NT levels in exhalation and lung disease severity. The research aims to develop a reliable method for quantifying 3-NT in exhaled breath, highlighting its relevance as a noninvasive diagnostic tool.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 3-Nitrotyrosine and exhalation, as the context discusses the detection of 3-NT in exhaled breath as a potential biomarker for lung diseases, supported by quantitative findings and implications for diagnosis.",
