    "context": "The target substance was removed from the reaction solution by adsorption onto a C18 POLAR RP cartridge (500mg) and elution by a solution of 2mM NH4Ac buffer and methanol (60/40, v/v) adjusted to pH 4.35. The purity of the reaction product in the eluent was proofed by LC\u2013MS/MS and was found to be 99.7%.Preconcentration and clean-up For clean-up and preconcentration of the analytes solid phase extraction (SPE) was performed using reverse phase material. The C18 POLAR RP cartridges (100mg) were preconditioned first by 4mL of a solution of 2mM NH4Ac buffer (pH 4.35) and methanol (60/40, v/v) and second by 1mL 2mM NH4Ac buffer (pH 4.35). Hundred microlitres internal standard solution (13C9-3-nitrotyrosine in 2mM NH4Ac, 2ng/mL) and 50\u03bcL 3N acetic acid were added to 500\u03bcL of exhaled breath condensate and the solution was transferred onto the cardridge. The cardridges were washed by 1mL 2mM NH4Ac buffer (pH 4.35) and sucked to dryness. For elution 1.5mL of a solution of 2mM NH4Ac buffer (pH 4.35) and methanol (60/40, v/v) were used. The eluate was concentrated to dryness by a stream of nitrogen and the residue was redissolved in 50\u03bcL of a solution of 2.4mM NH4Ac buffer and methanol (85/15, v/v; adjusted at pH 3.4 with acetic acid).
