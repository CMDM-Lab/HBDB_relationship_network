    "context": "On the other hand our NT levels are in agreement with the NT concentration presented by L\u00e4rstadt and co-workers in their presentation. They mentioned a mean value of 149\u00b193pg/mL for four healthy, non-smoking volunteers, which corresponds with the range of our results. In conclusion, the new procedure on the basis of clean-up and preconcentration by SPE, liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry was proved to be reliable and sensitive for the determination of free 3-nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate. The results for healthy subjects demonstrate the necessity of a highly sensitive method for the determination of nitrotyrosine in EBC. Moreover, these results confirm the problems of the immunochemical technique to generate accurate results, as mentioned by other authors [11,16\u201317]. Due to the proven reliability the new LC\u2013MS/MS method, this is the method of choice for the accurate quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine in EBC. Due to individual day-to-day variance of the parameters, an improved standardization of sampling conditions is recommended if 3-nitrotyrosine should be used for biological monitoring of inflammatory reactions in the airways.

        "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (NT) is analyzed as a biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for monitoring inflammatory reactions. The discussion focuses on the reliability and sensitivity of a new LC\u2013MS/MS method for quantifying NT levels. However, 'adjudication' is not explicitly defined or discussed in relation to NT, indicating a lack of direct connection between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the context of measuring NT levels, but there is no detailed discussion of how adjudication relates to the measurement or significance of 3-Nitrotyrosine.",
