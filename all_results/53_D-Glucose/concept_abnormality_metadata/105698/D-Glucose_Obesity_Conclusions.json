    "context": "[6] Bioelectric impedance analysis may not be an accurate measure of body fat content in morbidly obese subjects. [7] The weight of the patient was not fully stabilized at 6 months of follow-up. [1] In conclusion, our study confirms the metabolic variations in different fat compartments in obese patients. [2] Bariatric surgery improves insulin-stimulated glucose in skeletal muscle and in all fat compartments of obese subjects independent of diabetes status. [1] Acknowledgments.

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and obesity are related through the metabolic variations observed in obese patients. The study highlights that bariatric surgery enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and fat compartments, indicating a significant interaction between glucose metabolism and obesity. This suggests that managing glucose levels may be crucial in addressing obesity-related metabolic issues.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between D-Glucose and obesity, as the context discusses how bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism in obese patients, indicating a significant relationship supported by metabolic evidence.",
        "score": 4
