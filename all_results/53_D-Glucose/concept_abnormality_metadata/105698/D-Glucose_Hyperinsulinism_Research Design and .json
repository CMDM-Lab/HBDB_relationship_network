    "context": "[9] All studies were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital District of the Southwestern Finland. [1] Whole-body GU rate was determined using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique as previously described . [2] Insulin infusion rate was 1 mU \u00e2\u2039\u2026 min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 \u00e2\u2039\u2026 kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark). [3] During hyperinsulinemia, plasma glucose levels were maintained at 5 mmol/L using a variable infusion of 20% glucose based on arterialized glucose measurements every 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 min. [4] The rate of whole-body GU was calculated over the same time period that the measurements of adipose tissue GU were made and expressed both in total amount (mmol/min) and normalized by kilogram of fat-free mass (Mffm) (in \u00c2\u00b5mol \u00e2\u2039\u2026 min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 \u00e2\u2039\u2026 kgffm\u00e2\u02c6\u20191). [1] The PET studies were conducted both in the fasting condition and during the clamp  on separate days <2 weeks apart using the GE advanced PET camera (General Electric Medica Systems, Milwaukee, WI). [2] Subjects were in a supine position, and two catheters, one for infusion of glucose and insulin and for tracer injection and the other for arterialized blood sampling, were inserted into an antecubital vein of each arm.

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and hyperinsulinism are closely related through the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, which is used to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. During hyperinsulinemia, plasma glucose levels are maintained at a specific concentration, indicating a direct interaction where insulin regulates glucose levels in the bloodstream. This relationship is critical for understanding metabolic responses in conditions like hyperinsulinism.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly describes how D-Glucose is administered and regulated during hyperinsulinism, highlighting their critical interaction in metabolic studies.",
        "score": 5
