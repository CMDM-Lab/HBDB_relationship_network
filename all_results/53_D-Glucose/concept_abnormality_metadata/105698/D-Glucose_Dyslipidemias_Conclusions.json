    "context": "[4] In any event, as a combined result of less compromised insulin sensitivity and the expanded VF pool size, the contribution of VF to whole-body glucose disposal under insulinized conditions was twice as much in ND obese and four times as much in T2D obese patients as in control subjects (Fig. 1B). [5] Moreover, SC fat GU averaged 15% of whole-body glucose disposal in obese patients versus 4% in control subjects (Fig. 1D). [6] Therefore, despite the insulin resistance, fat expansion in the obese provides a sink for glucose, which would otherwise accumulate in the bloodstream and further impair glucose tolerance. [7] The converse problem, namely, the inability of adipose tissue to expand, is also conducive to reduced glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia . [1] Surgically induced major weight loss brought about improved insulin sensitivity and, in the T2D group, improved glucose tolerance, as expected. [2] However, skeletal muscle insulin-mediated GU was still subnormal in the obese group, especially in T2D patients, and VF insulin sensitivity was still impaired in the T2D group (Fig. 1B). [3] Whether insulin action would eventually normalize with further weight loss cannot be determined from the current data because these very obese patients rarely regain lean body weight. ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to dyslipidemias through the discussion of insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal in obese patients. The text highlights that impaired glucose tolerance and the inability of adipose tissue to expand contribute to dyslipidemia. Thus, while D-Glucose levels are affected by insulin resistance, the relationship with dyslipidemias is more about the metabolic consequences of glucose handling in obesity rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as D-Glucose is discussed in relation to insulin sensitivity and its impact on dyslipidemias in obese patients. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, focusing more on the broader metabolic context rather than a direct link.",
