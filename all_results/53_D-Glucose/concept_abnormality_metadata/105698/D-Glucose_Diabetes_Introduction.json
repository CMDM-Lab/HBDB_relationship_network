    "context": "[2] Combined PET/MRI thus provides anatomical and functional information on specific tissue compartments. [3] Bariatric surgery leads to major, sustained weight loss and improves metabolic and lipid profiles in obese individuals with or without T2D . [4] We hypothesized that bariatric surgery may have differential effects on metabolism in different adipose tissue compartments in severely obese patients. [5] We therefore combined PET/MRI to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on fat distribution and glucose uptake (GU) in different fat compartments in severely obese patients with or without diabetes.  [1] Patient population and study design have previously been described .  [2] Briefly, a total of 23 morbidly obese patients (BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a540 kg/m2 or \u00e2\u2030\u00a536 kg/m2 with an additional obesity-related comorbid condition) were recruited from the SLEEVEPASS study, a larger randomized controlled clinical trial comparing different surgical techniques for the treatment of morbid obesity (ClinicalTrials.gov,  [3] NCT00793143).

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to diabetes through the assessment of glucose uptake in different fat compartments post-bariatric surgery in severely obese patients, some of whom have diabetes. The study aims to understand how bariatric surgery affects metabolism and glucose utilization, which is crucial for managing diabetes. However, the specific relationship between D-Glucose and diabetes is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as D-Glucose is involved in the metabolic processes being studied in relation to diabetes, but the context does not provide a direct or detailed discussion of their relationship.",
