    "context": "[2] Combined PET/MRI thus provides anatomical and functional information on specific tissue compartments. [3] Bariatric surgery leads to major, sustained weight loss and improves metabolic and lipid profiles in obese individuals with or without T2D . [4] We hypothesized that bariatric surgery may have differential effects on metabolism in different adipose tissue compartments in severely obese patients. [5] We therefore combined PET/MRI to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on fat distribution and glucose uptake (GU) in different fat compartments in severely obese patients with or without diabetes.  [1] Patient population and study design have previously been described .  [2] Briefly, a total of 23 morbidly obese patients (BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a540 kg/m2 or \u00e2\u2030\u00a536 kg/m2 with an additional obesity-related comorbid condition) were recruited from the SLEEVEPASS study, a larger randomized controlled clinical trial comparing different surgical techniques for the treatment of morbid obesity (ClinicalTrials.gov,  [3] NCT00793143).

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and obesity are interconnected through the study of metabolic changes following bariatric surgery in severely obese patients. The research aims to assess how bariatric surgery affects glucose uptake in different adipose tissue compartments, highlighting the role of glucose metabolism in obesity management and the potential for improved metabolic profiles post-surgery. This suggests a significant relationship between glucose metabolism and obesity, particularly in the context of surgical interventions aimed at weight loss.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between D-Glucose and obesity, as the study investigates the effects of bariatric surgery on glucose uptake in obese patients, indicating a clear relationship between glucose metabolism and obesity management.",
        "score": 4
