    "context": "[2] We have recently reported a 31% incidence of large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants, defined as birth weight (BW) >2 SD above the mean, adjusted for gestational age (GA) and sex, in a national cohort of more than 5,000 offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers in Sweden between 1991 and 2003 . [3] Compared with data from 1982 to 1985 , the prevalence of LGA infants born to mothers with type 1 diabetes has increased by 50%. [4] High rates of fetal macrosomia in type 1 diabetic pregnancies have also been reported from other European countries . [1] High BW in offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers is associated with increased risks of obstetric and perinatal complications (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c) as well as with future risk of overweight, impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c). [2] The increasing incidence of fetal macrosomia in type 1 diabetic pregnancies is therefore worrying and warrants an explanation. [3] The high incidence of fetal macrosomia cannot only be attributed to poor metabolic control . [4] In fact, the rate of fetal macrosomia seems to remain high, despite apparently good metabolic control . ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to diabetes through its role in gestational diabetes and the impact of maternal glucose levels on fetal growth. The study highlights the increased incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants born to mothers with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that elevated glucose levels during pregnancy contribute to fetal macrosomia and associated health risks, including future diabetes in offspring. This indicates a significant connection between glucose metabolism and diabetes outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong relationship, as the context discusses how maternal diabetes and glucose levels affect fetal growth and future diabetes risk, supported by statistical data on LGA infants. However, it does not delve deeply into the biochemical mechanisms linking D-Glucose directly to diabetes.",
