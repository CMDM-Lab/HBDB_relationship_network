    "context": "[1] The first major finding of the current study is that prior to surgery, obese T2D patients had more VF mass than did ND patients (13 \u00c2\u00b1 7% vs. 8 \u00c2\u00b1 3% of total fat mass, P < 0.02) despite having virtually identical total fat mass (57 \u00c2\u00b1 4 vs. 58 \u00c2\u00b1 2 kg, P = nonsignificant). [2] Furthermore, insulin-stimulated GU in VF tissues was more impaired in T2D than in ND (Table 2). [3] Therefore, the presence of T2D (and \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc10-year older age) was associated with a selective visceral deposition of extra adipose tissue more resistant to insulin action. [4] In addition to the endogenous glucose overproduction and \u00ce\u00b2-cell dysfunction typical of T2D, the metabolic impact of this abnormal adipose tissue phenotype is reflected in the reciprocal relation of VF GU to both 2-h glucose levels and circulating FFA concentrations (Fig. 2). [1] The second major finding is that VF GU was 30 \u00c2\u00b1 7% of skeletal muscle GU in control subjects but twice that (57 \u00c2\u00b1 5%) in obese patients, whether T2D or ND. [2] Thus, the presence of severe obesity compromises skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity more than adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. [3] The cellular basis of this discrepancy, which to our knowledge has not been reported before, remains to be investigated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to functional disorders through its association with insulin sensitivity and metabolic dysfunction in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study highlights how impaired glucose utilization (GU) in visceral fat (VF) tissues correlates with elevated glucose levels and functional impairments in insulin action, indicating a link between glucose metabolism and functional disorders in obesity and T2D.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and functional disorders, as the context discusses how glucose levels and metabolism are affected by obesity and T2D, impacting insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic function.",
