    "context": "[2] Combined PET/MRI thus provides anatomical and functional information on specific tissue compartments. [3] Bariatric surgery leads to major, sustained weight loss and improves metabolic and lipid profiles in obese individuals with or without T2D . [4] We hypothesized that bariatric surgery may have differential effects on metabolism in different adipose tissue compartments in severely obese patients. [5] We therefore combined PET/MRI to assess the effect of bariatric surgery on fat distribution and glucose uptake (GU) in different fat compartments in severely obese patients with or without diabetes.  [1] Patient population and study design have previously been described .  [2] Briefly, a total of 23 morbidly obese patients (BMI \u00e2\u2030\u00a540 kg/m2 or \u00e2\u2030\u00a536 kg/m2 with an additional obesity-related comorbid condition) were recruited from the SLEEVEPASS study, a larger randomized controlled clinical trial comparing different surgical techniques for the treatment of morbid obesity (ClinicalTrials.gov,  [3] NCT00793143).

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to glucose uptake (GU) as the study investigates the effects of bariatric surgery on metabolism, specifically focusing on how it influences GU in different adipose tissue compartments in severely obese patients. The assessment of glucose uptake is crucial for understanding metabolic changes post-surgery, particularly in relation to D-Glucose levels, although the specific mechanisms or direct interactions are not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as D-Glucose is part of the metabolic assessment related to glucose uptake in the study, indicating a connection, but lacking detailed exploration of their direct relationship.",
