    "context": "[3] The cellular basis of this discrepancy, which to our knowledge has not been reported before, remains to be investigated. [4] In any event, as a combined result of less compromised insulin sensitivity and the expanded VF pool size, the contribution of VF to whole-body glucose disposal under insulinized conditions was twice as much in ND obese and four times as much in T2D obese patients as in control subjects (Fig. 1B). [5] Moreover, SC fat GU averaged 15% of whole-body glucose disposal in obese patients versus 4% in control subjects (Fig. 1D). [6] Therefore, despite the insulin resistance, fat expansion in the obese provides a sink for glucose, which would otherwise accumulate in the bloodstream and further impair glucose tolerance. [7] The converse problem, namely, the inability of adipose tissue to expand, is also conducive to reduced glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia . [1] Surgically induced major weight loss brought about improved insulin sensitivity and, in the T2D group, improved glucose tolerance, as expected. [2] However, skeletal muscle insulin-mediated GU was still subnormal in the obese group, especially in T2D patients, and VF insulin sensitivity was still impaired in the T2D group (Fig. 1B). ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin resistance are interconnected through the discussion of glucose disposal mechanisms in obese patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite insulin resistance, the expansion of visceral fat (VF) in obese individuals allows for increased glucose disposal, preventing further accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream. This suggests that while insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism, the body's compensatory mechanisms, such as fat expansion, play a crucial role in managing glucose levels.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and insulin resistance, as the context discusses how insulin resistance affects glucose disposal and the compensatory role of fat expansion in obese patients. The relationship is supported by evidence of altered glucose metabolism in the presence of insulin resistance.",
