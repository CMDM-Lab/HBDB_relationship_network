    "context": "[5] Moreover, SC fat GU averaged 15% of whole-body glucose disposal in obese patients versus 4% in control subjects (Fig. 1D). [6] Therefore, despite the insulin resistance, fat expansion in the obese provides a sink for glucose, which would otherwise accumulate in the bloodstream and further impair glucose tolerance. [7] The converse problem, namely, the inability of adipose tissue to expand, is also conducive to reduced glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia . [1] Surgically induced major weight loss brought about improved insulin sensitivity and, in the T2D group, improved glucose tolerance, as expected. [2] However, skeletal muscle insulin-mediated GU was still subnormal in the obese group, especially in T2D patients, and VF insulin sensitivity was still impaired in the T2D group (Fig. 1B). [3] Whether insulin action would eventually normalize with further weight loss cannot be determined from the current data because these very obese patients rarely regain lean body weight. [4] What is remarkable is that despite the massive reduction in fat mass, SC depots continued to make a threefold greater contribution to total insulin-mediated glucose disposal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcompared with lean control subjects\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a result of more efficient glucose utilization.

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to glucose tolerance, as the discussion revolves around glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity in obese patients. The text highlights how fat expansion in obesity affects glucose levels and tolerance, indicating that D-Glucose levels can influence glucose tolerance through mechanisms involving insulin resistance and adipose tissue function. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the broader implications of glucose metabolism in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as D-Glucose is part of the discussion on glucose tolerance, particularly in the context of insulin resistance and obesity. While the relationship is acknowledged, it lacks detailed exploration of how D-Glucose specifically impacts glucose tolerance.",
