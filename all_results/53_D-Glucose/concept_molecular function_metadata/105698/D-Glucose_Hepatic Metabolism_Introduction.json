    "context": "[1] Accumulation of abdominal VF is an independent risk factor for obesity-related metabolic abnormalities . [2] VF can be partitioned into intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal compartments using anatomical reference points such as the kidneys and ascending and descending colon . [3] The release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from the intraperitoneal depot drains into the portal system, interfering with hepatic glucose metabolism , leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. [4] Extraperitoneal fat, on the other hand, drains into the systemic circulation and thus is not directly involved in hepatic glucose metabolism . [1] Absolute quantification of fat mass is achieved by MRI, whereas tissue-specific glucose metabolism can be noninvasively assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) . [2] Combined PET/MRI thus provides anatomical and functional information on specific tissue compartments. [3] Bariatric surgery leads to major, sustained weight loss and improves metabolic and lipid profiles in obese individuals with or without T2D . ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to hepatic metabolism through the discussion of how free fatty acids (FFAs) from visceral fat (VF) affect glucose metabolism in the liver. The release of FFAs interferes with hepatic glucose metabolism, leading to conditions such as hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are critical in understanding metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity. While D-Glucose is not explicitly mentioned as being metabolized, its metabolism is implied to be affected by the hepatic processes discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as D-Glucose is connected to hepatic metabolism through the impact of FFAs on glucose metabolism in the liver, indicating a significant interaction in the context of obesity-related metabolic issues.",
        "score": 3
