    "context": "[3] The cellular basis of this discrepancy, which to our knowledge has not been reported before, remains to be investigated. [4] In any event, as a combined result of less compromised insulin sensitivity and the expanded VF pool size, the contribution of VF to whole-body glucose disposal under insulinized conditions was twice as much in ND obese and four times as much in T2D obese patients as in control subjects (Fig. 1B). [5] Moreover, SC fat GU averaged 15% of whole-body glucose disposal in obese patients versus 4% in control subjects (Fig. 1D). [6] Therefore, despite the insulin resistance, fat expansion in the obese provides a sink for glucose, which would otherwise accumulate in the bloodstream and further impair glucose tolerance. [7] The converse problem, namely, the inability of adipose tissue to expand, is also conducive to reduced glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia . [1] Surgically induced major weight loss brought about improved insulin sensitivity and, in the T2D group, improved glucose tolerance, as expected. [2] However, skeletal muscle insulin-mediated GU was still subnormal in the obese group, especially in T2D patients, and VF insulin sensitivity was still impaired in the T2D group (Fig. 1B). ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to blood circulation through its role in glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity. The text discusses how fat expansion in obese individuals serves as a sink for glucose, preventing its accumulation in the bloodstream, which is crucial for maintaining proper blood circulation and glucose tolerance. The relationship highlights the importance of glucose metabolism in the context of obesity and its effects on blood circulation, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and blood circulation, as the context discusses how glucose disposal impacts blood glucose levels and circulation, particularly in obese and T2D patients. The relationship is supported by evidence of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.",
