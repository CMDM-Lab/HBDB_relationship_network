    "context": "[1] T2D patients were classified as remitters if they achieved 2-h glucose levels <7.8 mmol/L on the OGTT and fasting glucose levels <7.0 mmol/L without diabetes medication . [2] Based on this criterion, five of the nine T2D subjects achieved remission at 6 months postsurgery. [1] Six months after surgery, T2D and ND patients had lost similar amounts of body weight (30 \u00c2\u00b1 3 and 27 \u00c2\u00b1 2 kg, respectively), and fat depots and fat-free mass were all reduced in size, although they were still larger than in control subjects. [2] At this time, metabolic parameters had improved significantly in both groups; HbA1c and glucose levels declined more in the T2D group, while whole-body insulin sensitivity remained subnormal in both groups. [1] At baseline, extraperitoneal fat mass was significantly larger in T2D than in ND (2.8 \u00c2\u00b1 1.2 vs. 1.8 \u00c2\u00b1 0.6 kg, P = 0.02). [2] Similarly, T2D patients had increased amounts of intraperitoneal fat than ND (4.5 \u00c2\u00b1 0.8 vs. 2.9 \u00c2\u00b1 0.7 kg, P < 0.001). [3] After surgery, total VF mass remained higher in T2D than in ND (4.7 \u00c2\u00b1 0.9 vs. 2.8 \u00c2\u00b1 0.3 kg, P = 0.02), while abdominal deep SC was higher in ND than T2D (6.3 \u00c2\u00b1 2.1 vs. 4.5 \u00c2\u00b1 0.8 kg, P = 0.03).

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin sensitivity are related through their roles in the metabolic parameters of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients. Although glucose levels improved post-surgery, whole-body insulin sensitivity remained subnormal in both T2D and non-diabetic (ND) groups. This suggests that while glucose control is essential, it does not fully restore insulin sensitivity, indicating a complex relationship between glucose metabolism and insulin action in T2D.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and insulin sensitivity, as the context discusses their interrelationship in the metabolic response of T2D patients. The evidence of improved glucose levels alongside persistent insulin sensitivity issues indicates a critical relationship in diabetes management.",
