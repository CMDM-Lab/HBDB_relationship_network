    "context": "[4] The concentration of saturated fatty acids in the deep layer is higher compared with the superficial layer, providing additional evidence of its higher metabolic activity . [1] Accumulation of abdominal VF is an independent risk factor for obesity-related metabolic abnormalities . [2] VF can be partitioned into intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal compartments using anatomical reference points such as the kidneys and ascending and descending colon . [3] The release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from the intraperitoneal depot drains into the portal system, interfering with hepatic glucose metabolism , leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. [4] Extraperitoneal fat, on the other hand, drains into the systemic circulation and thus is not directly involved in hepatic glucose metabolism . [1] Absolute quantification of fat mass is achieved by MRI, whereas tissue-specific glucose metabolism can be noninvasively assessed using positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) . [2] Combined PET/MRI thus provides anatomical and functional information on specific tissue compartments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin resistance are related through the metabolic effects of visceral fat (VF) accumulation. The release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from intraperitoneal fat interferes with hepatic glucose metabolism, leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This suggests that disturbances in glucose metabolism are closely linked to the presence of insulin resistance, particularly in the context of obesity-related metabolic abnormalities.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and insulin resistance, as the context discusses how FFAs impact glucose metabolism and contribute to insulin resistance, indicating a clear relationship supported by metabolic evidence.",
        "score": 4
