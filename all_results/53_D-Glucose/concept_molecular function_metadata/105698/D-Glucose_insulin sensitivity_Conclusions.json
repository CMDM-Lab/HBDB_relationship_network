    "context": "[5] Moreover, SC fat GU averaged 15% of whole-body glucose disposal in obese patients versus 4% in control subjects (Fig. 1D). [6] Therefore, despite the insulin resistance, fat expansion in the obese provides a sink for glucose, which would otherwise accumulate in the bloodstream and further impair glucose tolerance. [7] The converse problem, namely, the inability of adipose tissue to expand, is also conducive to reduced glucose tolerance and dyslipidemia . [1] Surgically induced major weight loss brought about improved insulin sensitivity and, in the T2D group, improved glucose tolerance, as expected. [2] However, skeletal muscle insulin-mediated GU was still subnormal in the obese group, especially in T2D patients, and VF insulin sensitivity was still impaired in the T2D group (Fig. 1B). [3] Whether insulin action would eventually normalize with further weight loss cannot be determined from the current data because these very obese patients rarely regain lean body weight. [4] What is remarkable is that despite the massive reduction in fat mass, SC depots continued to make a threefold greater contribution to total insulin-mediated glucose disposal\u00e2\u20ac\u201dcompared with lean control subjects\u00e2\u20ac\u201das a result of more efficient glucose utilization.

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin sensitivity are interconnected through the discussion of glucose disposal in obese patients. Despite insulin resistance, the expansion of subcutaneous (SC) fat allows for glucose uptake, which helps prevent further glucose accumulation in the bloodstream. The study highlights that weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, indicating a direct relationship between D-Glucose levels and the body's ability to respond to insulin effectively.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and insulin sensitivity, as the context discusses how glucose disposal is affected by insulin sensitivity in obese patients, supported by evidence of improved insulin sensitivity with weight loss.",
