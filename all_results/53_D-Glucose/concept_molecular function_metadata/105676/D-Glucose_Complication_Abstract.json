    "context": "[2] We have recently reported a 31% incidence of large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants, defined as birth weight (BW) >2 SD above the mean, adjusted for gestational age (GA) and sex, in a national cohort of more than 5,000 offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers in Sweden between 1991 and 2003 . [3] Compared with data from 1982 to 1985 , the prevalence of LGA infants born to mothers with type 1 diabetes has increased by 50%. [4] High rates of fetal macrosomia in type 1 diabetic pregnancies have also been reported from other European countries . [1] High BW in offspring of type 1 diabetic mothers is associated with increased risks of obstetric and perinatal complications (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c) as well as with future risk of overweight, impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c). [2] The increasing incidence of fetal macrosomia in type 1 diabetic pregnancies is therefore worrying and warrants an explanation. [3] The high incidence of fetal macrosomia cannot only be attributed to poor metabolic control . [4] In fact, the rate of fetal macrosomia seems to remain high, despite apparently good metabolic control . ",

        "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to complications arising from pregnancies in type 1 diabetic mothers. The high levels of D-Glucose associated with poor metabolic control can lead to fetal macrosomia, which is linked to increased risks of obstetric and perinatal complications. The study highlights the worrying trend of rising fetal macrosomia rates despite good metabolic control, indicating a complex relationship between glucose levels and pregnancy complications.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between D-Glucose and complications, as elevated glucose levels in diabetic pregnancies are associated with increased risks of fetal macrosomia and related complications. The context provides evidence of this relationship, although it does not delve deeply into the mechanisms.",
