    "context": " [7] Thus, the sensitivity of VSCCs as well as the other channel types is within the brain concentration range associated with impairments.  [8] Similarly, the TCE levels used in the present experiments (24\u00e2\u20ac\u201c260 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml; IC50 = 196 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) are consistent with brain levels associated with visual evoked potential impairment in rodents (20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c120 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml; ).  [9] Finally, the relative potencies for VOC effects on VSCCs agree with in vivo data, where PERC and TCE are the most and least potent, respectively. [10] Using a swimming protocol that induced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behavioral despair immobility\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, De Ceaurriz et al.  demonstrated that PERC was a more potent inhibitor of immobility than was TOL after inhalation exposure. [11] Furthermore, PERC was the most potent and TCE was the least potent of these VOCs at increasing motor activity after inhalation exposure . [12] Thus, the concentrations and relative potencies for VOC effects on VSCCs are consistent with those for in vivo exposures. [1] Although acute exposure to TOL and other VOCs causes effects similar to ethanol and CNS depressants , the roles of specific receptors mediating VOC effects in vivo have not yet been thoroughly examined.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its effects on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) and its potency as an inhibitor compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights that TCE has a lower potency as an inhibitor of behavioral despair compared to PERC, indicating that TCE's inhibitory effects are less significant. However, the specific mechanisms by which TCE acts as an inhibitor are not thoroughly examined, leaving the relationship somewhat vague.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TCE is mentioned in the context of its inhibitory effects on VSCCs and behavioral responses, but the details of its interaction with specific inhibitors or mechanisms are not fully explored.",
