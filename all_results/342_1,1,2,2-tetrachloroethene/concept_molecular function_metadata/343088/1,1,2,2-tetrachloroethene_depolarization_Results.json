    "context": "[2] The calculated concentration-equivalence curve for concentrations of PERC and TCE (solid lines) that are equivalent (produce the same degree of inhibition) as a range of TOL concentrations. [3] The 95% confidence limits (broken lines) were computed by a Monte-Carlo method. [1] I/V relationships in the presence and absence of VOCs. [2] A, peak current amplitude obtained from a step depolarization to the indicated test potentials from a holding potential of \u00e2\u20ac\u201c70 mV is plotted in the presence and absence of 857 \u00ce\u00bcM TOL (top; n = 6), 2.1 mM TCE (middle; n = 7), and 152 \u00ce\u00bcM PERC (bottom; n = 5). [3] The arrows indicate current amplitudes that are greater in the presence of VOC. [4] A three-way ANOVA indicated significant effects of treatment, solvent, and voltage and significant interactions between treatment and voltage and voltage and solvent. [5] Step-down two-way ANOVAs indicated significant differences in effects of TOL at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c10-, 10-, 20-, and 30-mV test potentials [as indicated by the asterisk (*)]. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is evaluated alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for its effects on peak current amplitude during step depolarization experiments. The data suggests that the presence of PERC, along with TCE and TOL, influences the current responses at various test potentials, indicating a relationship between these VOCs and the depolarization process in the studied system. However, the specific role of PERC in the depolarization mechanism is not detailed, leaving the relationship somewhat ambiguous.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as PERC is involved in the depolarization experiments, showing some interaction with the current responses. However, the lack of detailed discussion on how PERC specifically affects depolarization limits the strength of their relationship.",
