    "context": "lx. All illumination in the chambers was measured using a photometer with cosine probe attachment (models DR2000 and D2000, respectively, EG&G, Inc., Salem MA). The cosine probe was mounted in the center of the chamber floor prior to taking measurements. MED PC software (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) controlled all behavioral testing, signal stimuli, and vapor concentration monitoring (see below).Apparatus \u2014 perchloroethylene exposures Perchloroethylene (PCE, 99.9% purity, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) vapor was generated within each operant-inhalation chamber and monitored as previously described. Inlet air was cleaned with carbon and HEPA filters and conditioned to 22\u00b12\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00b110% relative humidity; air flow rates through these exposure chambers were approximately 20\u00a0L/min. The rise time (t 95) of PCE vapor concentrations was 6\u00a0min. Each rat was always tested and exposed in the same chamber. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned as a vapor generated for exposure testing in operant-inhalation chambers. However, there is no direct discussion regarding its impact on inspiration function or respiratory effects. The focus is primarily on the measurement and control of vapor concentrations rather than any physiological implications related to inspiration function.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and inspiration function, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
