    "context": "1,1,2-Trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, chloromethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,2-dicloroethane and vinyl chloride were found in only a very few points while hexachlorobutadiene was never found. In conclusion, the presence of VOCs in Sicilian groundwaters is influenced by anthropogenic activity. In fact, the concentration of the VOCs measured with the proposed monitoring, SPME based method, exceeded the guideline values proposed by the EC in only three aquifers, all three of which are located close to industrial and intense agricultural areas. Perchloroethylene (PCE) is an aliphatic, halogenated hydrocarbon used commercially in dry cleaning, textile processing, and metal cleaning operations. Due to its wide variety of uses and prevalence in air and in ground water near industrial sites, exposure can occur through inhalation as well as through ingestion from contaminated water sources. PCE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) primarily affect the central nervous system due to their high lipophilicity. Thus, information regarding the neurotoxicity of PCE is important to risk assessors and agencies regulating this and other VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in relation to their presence in groundwater influenced by anthropogenic activities. The term 'Process' refers to the monitoring and assessment of VOCs, including 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene, in industrial and agricultural settings. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the processes of monitoring or assessing its impact is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the monitoring of VOCs in environmental contexts, but there is no detailed discussion of how 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene specifically interacts with or influences the processes mentioned.",
