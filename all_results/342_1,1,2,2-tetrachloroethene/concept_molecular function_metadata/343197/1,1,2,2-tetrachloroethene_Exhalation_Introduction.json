    "context": "In this work, the applicability of SPME to accomplish the biological monitoring of organic compounds in end-exhaled air has been studied. We have focused the study on tetrachloroethylene as a model compound\u2014a solvent used in dry-cleaning shops and in metal cleaning operations. The capacity of humans to metabolize tetrachloroethylene is limited. It is known that only 1\u20133% of the amount of tetrachloroethylene absorbed is metabolized to trichloroacetic acid by humans, the remaining being excreted unchanged in exhaled air. This fact turns tetrachloroethylene into a good model of respiratory elimination. This compound is also interesting because is one of the compounds that have a biological limit value. Studies in controlled atmosphere The determination of the calibration curve includes the preparation of standard gas mixtures of organic vapour in air. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is highlighted as a model compound for studying biological monitoring through exhalation. The text indicates that a significant portion of tetrachloroethene absorbed by humans is exhaled unchanged, making it an effective marker for respiratory elimination. This relationship underscores the compound's relevance in assessing exposure through breath analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and exhalation, as the context discusses its limited metabolism and high exhalation rate, indicating its utility in biological monitoring. The relationship is supported by the compound's characteristics as a model for respiratory elimination.",
        "score": 4
