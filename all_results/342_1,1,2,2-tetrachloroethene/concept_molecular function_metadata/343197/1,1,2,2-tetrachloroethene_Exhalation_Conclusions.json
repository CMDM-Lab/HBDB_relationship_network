    "context": "Future research needs to concentrate on this topic. SPME can be very useful for the biological monitoring of organic compounds in exhaled breath of occupationally exposed people. The method proposed in this study combines the sampling of alveolar breath using a glass tube with SPME, thus, allowing the quantification of volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath. The extraction of tetrachloroethylene in exhaled breath samples shows good repeatability and the calibration curve also shows good linearity. The analytical procedure described here is simple, fast and highly reproducible. The proposed method could also be applied to other volatile organic compounds. Obviously, a calibration curve must be obtained for every compound to be checked. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is analyzed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be monitored through exhalation. The study discusses the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for sampling and quantifying this compound in the exhaled breath of individuals exposed occupationally. The method demonstrates good repeatability and linearity in calibration, indicating its effectiveness for biological monitoring of VOCs in breath samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and exhalation, as the study focuses on the quantification of this compound in exhaled breath, supported by evidence of method reliability and applicability to other VOCs.",
        "score": 4
