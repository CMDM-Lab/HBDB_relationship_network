    "context": "The results for assessment of exposure to PCE are shown in Table 3. This study was designed to develop a needle trap microextraction technique as a new and in-progress method that can be used for the sampling and analysis of different compounds in air. NTD is an inexpensive microextraction technique which can be used for the sampling and determination of a wide range of compounds in a single-step. This is the first report on the use of graphene nanoplatelets used with a NTD for determination of perchloroethylene in air. The study consisted of a laboratory and field phase. In the laboratory phase sampling and analytical performances of NTD-contained nanostructured sorbent was compared to the SPME technique. In the field NTDs were used for the environmental and occupational monitoring of PCE in dry cleaning and compared with the NIOSH 1003 method for HVOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned in relation to a study focused on developing a needle trap microextraction technique for sampling and analyzing various compounds in air, including PCE. However, the term 'Adjudication' does not appear to have a direct connection or relevance to the analysis or monitoring of PCE exposure, as it is not discussed in the context of the study's findings or methods.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
