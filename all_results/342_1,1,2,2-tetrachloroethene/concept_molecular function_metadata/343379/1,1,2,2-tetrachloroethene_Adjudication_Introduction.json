    "context": "In this paper we describe the application of needle trap microextraction devices packed with graphene nano-platelets for sampling and analysis of perchloroethylene in the laboratory and the field. This study was carried out in two phases. In the first the laboratory parameters for sampling and analysis of perchloroethylene by NTD sampler were evaluated and optimized. Then the sampler was used for determination of perchloroethylene in dry cleaning. Reagents and standards Multi-layer graphene nanoplatelets ( Fig. 1) with fewer than 30 layers, a purity higher than 95.5wt%, a thickness of 4\u201320nm, and a particle diameter 5\u201310\u00b5m were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Chengdu Organic Chemicals, Chengdu, China). Perchloroethylene in analytical grade was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany).Instrumentation Chromatography was performed using a Varian 3800 GC with a capillary column (VOCOL with 60m\u00d70.25mm\u00d70.25\u00b5m) equipped with a Saturn 2200 MS system and a split-splitless injector.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a chemical analyzed using needle trap microextraction devices for sampling and analysis, particularly in dry cleaning applications. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears without any clear connection to the chemical analysis or its implications, indicating no direct relationship between the two terms in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
