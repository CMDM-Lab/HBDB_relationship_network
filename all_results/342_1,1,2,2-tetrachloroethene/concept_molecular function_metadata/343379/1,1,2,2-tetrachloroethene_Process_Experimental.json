    "context": "For each desorption time and temperature, the lowest levels that caused the highest peak responses were selected as the preferred values. The percentage of carryover also depends on desorption time and temperature therefore these GC parameters should be selected so that quantitative desorption occurs with the least amount of carryover. To select the optimum desorption time and temperature, carryover and possible memory effect were investigated in a second desorption cycle two minutes after the first. For desorption times ranging from 1 to 4min, the peak area acquired in the second desorption process was plotted as the amount of carryover accrued and the resulting graph was used to determine the optimum time required for conditioning the NTD between sampling cycles.Field sampling by NTDs packed with nanoplatelets graphene After optimizing all aspects of NTD sampling in the laboratory, NTDs packed with graphene nanoplatelets were used to determine the concentration of perchloroethylene in a dry-cleaning shop. This was done by connecting NTDs to calibrated low-volume personal sampling pumps. Sampling flow rates of 3mL/min and sampling volumes of 30mL were used. These sampling sets were attached to workers in the respiratory zone of the dry-cleaning shop to estimate their exposure to PCE.Method validation and comparative study Validation of the NTD technique was performed under the optimized conditions determined previously in this study for the quantitative analysis of the target compound in a standard chamber.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned as a target compound for exposure assessment in a dry-cleaning shop, where a specific sampling process using nanoplatelets graphene was optimized for its detection. The relationship between PCE and the sampling process is indirect, as the focus is on the methodology for quantifying PCE exposure rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship between the two.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is part of the sampling process being evaluated, but there is no detailed discussion of how the process specifically relates to the properties or effects of PCE.",
