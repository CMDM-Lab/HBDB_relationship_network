    "context": "For these measurements, the sampling locations were much closer to the upper layer of waste than those of the other measurements, thereby explaining the high concentration measurements. The results are synthesised in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. A continuous layout was selected to connect distinct points as it highlights variations of VOC concentrations more clearly. Fig. 3 (measurements of April 7) shows the evolution of VOC concentrations which appear close for all compounds, with three high peaks of concentrations at about 11 p.m. and 11:50 p.m. for tetrachloroethylene, heptane and toluene. These concentrations can be explained by the arrival of trucks loaded with waste containing these compounds and by intensive compaction vehicles activity which stirred up the waste. The VOC emissions (type and quantity) vary as a function of the origin of the waste, especially in the case of a dump taking in household waste as well as standard industrial and commercial waste, as in the case of the site studied. Since the temperatures on April 7 were low with constant atmospheric pressure, the main parameters liable to influence the evolution of concentrations of VOCs and the diffusion of the latter into the atmosphere were the activities of the trucks unloading and waste compaction vehicles and the wind speed.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose concentrations were measured over time, indicating its presence in the environment. The term 'evolution' refers to the changes in VOC concentrations observed during the sampling period, influenced by factors such as waste truck activity and atmospheric conditions. However, there is no direct biological or chemical relationship established between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the concept of evolution in a biological sense.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the study of VOC concentrations over time, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or significance beyond their co-occurrence in the context.",
