    "context": "These findings are not consistent with either the PERC meta-analysis (Guth et al., 1997) where results predicted that humans were two times more sensitive to this compound in comparison to rats, or with the TOL meta-analysis (Benignus et al., 1998) which found that humans were five times more sensitive to TOL than rats. Thus, the species differences observed in the meta-analyses are unlikely to arise from species differences in nAChR susceptibility at the toxicodynamic level. Many factors could contribute to possible species differences to VOC effects. For example, there are differences in human and rat sensitivity and toxicokinetics to both TOL (Benignus et al., 1998) and PERC (Guth et al., 1997). Although no differences in VOC sensitivity and current responses were present between the human and rat nACh receptors, perhaps other receptors or ion channels may be also associated with changes in VOC sensitivity between species. VOCs act at many receptors in the central nervous system. For example, in addition to the effects on the nAChRs, VOCs inhibit NMDA receptors (Cruz et al., 1998, 2000), potentiate GABAA and glycine receptors (Beckstead et al., 2000, 2001), increase in serotonin receptor activity (Lopreato et al., 2003), and alter calcium channel activity (Tillar et al., 2002).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed in relation to toxicokinetics, particularly regarding species sensitivity differences between humans and rats. The text highlights that toxicokinetic factors may contribute to the observed differences in sensitivity to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene, suggesting that understanding these differences is crucial for assessing human health risks associated with exposure to such compounds. However, the specific toxicokinetic properties of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene are not detailed, limiting the depth of the relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the toxicokinetics of VOCs, including 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene, in terms of species sensitivity. While there is a connection, the lack of specific details about 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene's toxicokinetics limits the strength of the relationship.",
