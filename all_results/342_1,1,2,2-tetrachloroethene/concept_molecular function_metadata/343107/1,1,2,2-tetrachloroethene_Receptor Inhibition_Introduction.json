    "context": "The \u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b17 receptors were chosen due to their global receptor expression patterns in the CNS. The \u03b13\u03b22 nAChR was also selected because of its high expression in the autonomic ganglia, although there is also some expression in the CNS (for a review, see Leonard and Bertrand, 2001). Recombinant receptors of each type were expressed in Xenopus oocytes for all studies. The effects of PERC on nAChRs were compared to those of TOL to determine whether the similar qualitative behavioral effects are reflected in similar profiles of receptor inhibition in vitro. Furthermore, comparisons were made between human and rat nAChRs to determine whether differences in toxicodynamic sensitivity of the receptors could contribute to differences in behavioral sensitivity to VOCs. Methods Chemicals TOL (99.0% pure, HPLC-grade), PERC (99.0% ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is being studied for its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically \u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b17 subtypes, which are important in the central nervous system (CNS). The research aims to compare the receptor inhibition profiles of PERC with those of toluene (TOL) to understand their behavioral effects and toxicodynamic sensitivity. This indicates a direct relationship between PERC and receptor inhibition, as the study focuses on how PERC influences nAChR activity, which is crucial for understanding its neurotoxic effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and receptor inhibition, as the study provides evidence of PERC's effects on nAChRs, indicating a clear relationship within the context of neurotoxicity and receptor dynamics.",
        "score": 4
