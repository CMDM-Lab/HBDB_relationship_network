    "context": "[2] The present data support the hypothesis that effects on VSCC could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of VOCs. [3] By incorporating such information into models for solvent neurotoxicity , the scientific basis for predicting the risks associated with exposure to these and possibly other VOCs will be improved. Introduction Toluene (TOL) and perchloroethylene (PERC) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) widely used in industrial products and processes. Briefly, PERC has been used in dry cleaning and metal degreasing processes and TOL is commonly found in paints, paint thinners, and gasoline sources. Effects of these VOCs on function of the central nervous system (CNS) are of great interest due to their widespread use and exposure potential. For both compounds, inhalation is the typical route of human exposure, although they can be absorbed dermally and in some cases ingested (for reviews, see Arlien-Soborg, 1992; \u00d8stergaard, 2000). Based on similarities in their adverse behavioral effects, it is hypothesized that VOCs disrupt nervous system function via common mechanisms (for a review, see Balster, 1998). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like toluene and perchloroethylene, which are used in various industrial processes. The discussion focuses on the neurotoxic effects of these VOCs and their common mechanisms of action, suggesting that 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is part of a broader category of substances that impact central nervous system function through similar processes. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the term 'Process' is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is included in a discussion about VOCs used in industrial processes, but there is no specific information on how it relates to the term 'Process' beyond being part of a general category.",
