    "context": "At low concentrations, PERC is more potent than TOL by nearly an order of magnitude. However, as the concentrations increase, the potency differences diminish between the solvents (at theoretical ranges). Both human and rat nAChRs were more sensitive to PERC than TOL at the tested concentrations in this study. At the lower VOC concentrations, this effect was not surprising because in comparative studies (PERC and TOL), PERC causes adverse behavioral effects at lower exposure concentrations (Echeverria et al., 1991, 1995; Kjellstrand et al., 1985). Several laboratories have demonstrated that single amino acid changes in the transmembrane domains (TMD) of a receptor subunit, particularly in the second or third TMD, can change the sensitivity of the entire receptor to ethanol or general anesthetics (GABAA/glycine receptors: Beckstead et al., 2001; Mihic et al., 1997; NMDA receptor: Ronald et al., 2001; nicotinic receptor: Yamakura et al., 2000). Yamakura et al. (2000) found that single amino acid changes in the second TMD of nAChRs \u03b2 subunits conferred changes in general anesthetic sensitivity. It is possible that sensitivities of the heteromeric receptors to VOCs were not significantly different between the species because potential VOC sites on\u00a0\u03b14\u03b22 and \u03b13\u03b22 receptors were unchanged between rat and human receptors.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is highlighted for its adverse behavioral effects at lower exposure concentrations compared to toluene (TOL). The study indicates that PERC is more potent than TOL, particularly at low concentrations, leading to significant adverse effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This suggests a direct relationship between PERC exposure and negative behavioral outcomes, emphasizing the importance of understanding its toxicological impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between PERC and adverse effects, supported by evidence of behavioral impacts at varying concentrations. The context provides a clear link between the chemical's potency and its adverse effects, indicating a strong relevance in toxicological studies.",
        "score": 4
