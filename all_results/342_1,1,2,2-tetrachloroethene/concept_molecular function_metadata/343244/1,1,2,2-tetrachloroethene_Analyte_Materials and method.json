    "context": "Measurements were grouped into two multivariate data sets, one labeled as \u201cNorth Sea\u201d, the other as \u201cScheldt estuary\u201d. Each variable was censored at the decision limit and reported as \u201c<x det\u201d, with x det the numerical value of the detection limit. A single censoring value was used for each compound throughout the study. Censoring intensities for each analyte in both data sets are given in Fig. 1 .Approach Three compounds remained uncensored: 1,1,2-trichloroethane and tetrachloroethene (\u201cScheldt estuary\u201d), and o-xylene (\u201cNorth Sea\u201d). Each of these data sets was artificially censored by gradually discarding the lowest uncensored measurement from the ranked set of values. At each degree of censoring, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median and interquartile range (IQR) were estimated by several statistical procedures described below. Method performance was assessed by a relative error- or bias-term, calculated as 100 ( \u03b8 \u0302 censor \u2212 \u03b8 \u0302 uncensor ) \u03b8 \u0302 uncensor , with  \u03b8 \u0302 censor and  \u03b8 \u0302 uncensor sample parameter estimates computed from censored and uncensored data sets, respectively.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the compounds analyzed within two multivariate data sets, specifically in relation to the Scheldt estuary. The term 'analyte' refers to any substance being analyzed or measured, which includes 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene as part of the study's focus on environmental contaminants. However, there is no detailed discussion of the specific relationship or significance of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene as an analyte beyond its inclusion in the data sets.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is categorized as an analyte in the study, but there is no detailed exploration of its specific interactions or implications within the context.",
