    "context": "Relative error then decreases, and between 60% and 80% of censoring becomes even smaller than the BRML estimator. Unlike the estimation of moments, little or no improvement is noticed when the robust imputation method is implemented for computation of the median. Also for the interquartile range, except for Cohen\u2019s maximum likelihood method at the low censoring levels, bias is not significantly reduced when censored observations are imputed. This is true for all three analytes and is shown for tetrachloroethene in Fig. 5. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, percentiles can be transformed back to original scale units without transformation bias. Secondly, since they are more robust towards the presence of outliers, they are less influenced by lack of fit to the lognormal distribution. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the analytes being evaluated for statistical estimation methods. The discussion focuses on the performance of various estimation techniques in the presence of censored data, highlighting that the robust imputation method shows little improvement for this analyte. However, the relationship is primarily statistical rather than chemical or biological, indicating that 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is simply one of several analytes under consideration in the analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is included among analytes in a statistical context, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific properties or interactions beyond its role in the analysis.",
