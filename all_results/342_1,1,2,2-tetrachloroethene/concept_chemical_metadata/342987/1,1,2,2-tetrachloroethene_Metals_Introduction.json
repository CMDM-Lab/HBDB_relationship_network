    "context": "1,1,2-Trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, chloromethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 1,2-dicloroethane and vinyl chloride were found in only a very few points while hexachlorobutadiene was never found. In conclusion, the presence of VOCs in Sicilian groundwaters is influenced by anthropogenic activity. In fact, the concentration of the VOCs measured with the proposed monitoring, SPME based method, exceeded the guideline values proposed by the EC in only three aquifers, all three of which are located close to industrial and intense agricultural areas. Perchloroethylene (PCE) is an aliphatic, halogenated hydrocarbon used commercially in dry cleaning, textile processing, and metal cleaning operations. Due to its wide variety of uses and prevalence in air and in ground water near industrial sites, exposure can occur through inhalation as well as through ingestion from contaminated water sources. PCE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) primarily affect the central nervous system due to their high lipophilicity. Thus, information regarding the neurotoxicity of PCE is important to risk assessors and agencies regulating this and other VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in groundwater, particularly in areas influenced by industrial and agricultural activities. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with metals. While metals may be present in contaminated sites, the context does not establish a clear connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and metals, focusing instead on the neurotoxic effects of VOCs like perchloroethylene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and metals may be present in contaminated environments, but their specific relationship is not detailed in the context provided.",
