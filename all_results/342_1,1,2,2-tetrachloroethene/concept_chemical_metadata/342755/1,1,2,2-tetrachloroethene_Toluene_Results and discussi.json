    "context": "Good precision was obtained for the majority of studied compounds. Method quantitation limit (MQL) for compounds present in the air of studied places was evaluated for the whole procedure, starting from the sampling of air and ending with the transport and handling of the VERAM deployed devices in vehicle repair shops. To do it, the chromatographic signals obtained in the different places in which the target molecules were identified, were evaluated; taking into account the S/N ratio in order to fix the minimum amount of considered compounds that provide a S/N ratio of 10. In these conditions the MQL value for benzene was 40, for toluene was 30, for ethylbenzene 140, for m,p-xylene 180, for o-xylene 150 and for tetrachloroethene 50ngVERAM\u22121, which correspond to 0.05 till 0.15mgm\u22123. Fig. 2 shows the HS\u2013GC\u2013MS chromatogram obtained in full scan mode for a VERAM device spiked with 7.5\u03bcgVERAM\u22121 VOC standard mixture and extracted ion chromatograms found for one VERAM deployed in a sampling site of a car repair shop for 48h. As it can be seen the peak resolution achieved was satisfactory to analyze all considered VOCs with enough sensitivity in only 10min.Uptake behavior of pollutants in VERAM devices The uptake of chemicals by passive samplers can be easily explained in three different stages: (i) a linear uptake, (ii) a curvilinear step, and (iii) equilibrium with the sampling media. Thus, the same passive sampler can operate in two modes: kinetic, for short sampling times, and equilibrium, for long times, depending only on the exposure time. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) evaluated for their presence in air samples from vehicle repair shops. The method quantitation limits (MQL) for both compounds are provided, indicating their detection thresholds in the studied environment. However, there is no direct discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other beyond their classification as VOCs and their quantification in the same study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are part of the same analysis of VOCs in air samples, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
