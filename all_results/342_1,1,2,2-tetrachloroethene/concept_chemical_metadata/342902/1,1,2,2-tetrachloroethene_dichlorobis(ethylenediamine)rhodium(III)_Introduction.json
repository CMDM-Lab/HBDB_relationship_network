    "context": "The surface of the capillary fringe can be thought of as the locus of points at a minimum height above the water table where the gravimetric water content is greater than the residual water content (Ronen et\u00a0al., 1997). Because the SUIR is the region of the aquifer where the transfer of compounds from the vapor phase of the unsaturated zone to the aqueous phase of the saturated zone and vice versa occurs, it has a central role in contaminant dynamics in the subsurface. Examining and understanding the distribution and fluxes of Cl-VOCs across this interface thus can have both theoretical and practical importance for coping with the movement of these contaminants in the underground. In this paper we report field evidence for the independent and simultaneous counter-flow of seven Cl-VOCs, (trichloroethene, TCE; tetrachloroethene, PCE; 1,1-dichloroethene, 1,1-DCE; cis-1,2-dichloroethene, cis-1,2-DCE; 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,1-TCA; chloroform, CHCl3, and 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1-DCA) across the SUIR in a contaminated part of the sandy Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel. The data affords new insights into transport phenomena of VOCs at the SUIR under natural gradient field conditions. To the best of our knowledge, observations such as shown here have not been previously reported. At the study site, a former military industry facility chiefly involved in metal-working and plating, the aquifer is composed mainly of sand and sandstone with intercalating clay lenses. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) are not directly related. The discussion focuses on the transport and dynamics of various chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) in an aquifer, with no mention of dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) or its interactions with 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene. The context primarily addresses the behavior of Cl-VOCs in the subsurface environment, lacking any specific connection to the rhodium complex.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects the absence of any direct or indirect relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) in the context provided. They are mentioned in separate discussions without any interaction or relevance.",
