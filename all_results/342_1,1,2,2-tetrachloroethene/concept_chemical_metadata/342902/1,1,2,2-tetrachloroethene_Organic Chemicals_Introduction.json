Total CVOC mass in the source zone was greatly decreased by 86% two and half years following EZVI injection using pneumatic fracturing injection. \u2022 Mobilization of DNAPL during or after EZVI injection could occur, which presents challenges in conducting an accurate performance evaluation. Contamination of saturated and unsaturated zones of aquifers by chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) such as tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene and chloroform is a well known phenomenon that has resulted in widespread pollution problems around the world (e.g., Lenhard et\u00a0al., 1995; Conant et\u00a0al., 1996; Smith et\u00a0al., 1996; Choi et\u00a0al., 2002; Laor et\u00a0al., 2003; Ronen et\u00a0al., 2005; Graber et\u00a0al., 2008). VOCs present a unique problem, in so much as they spread readily in the subsurface in several phases: the vapor phase, the aqueous phase and the non-aqueous phase. Transport in each of these phases contributes in its own way to exacerbating the contamination and increasing the risks to different receptors. The transport mechanisms of Cl-VOC vapors through bulk unsaturated porous media have been the subject of numerous investigations (e.g., Marrin and Kerfoot, 1988; Falta et\u00a0al., 1989; Massmann and Farrier, 1992; Smith et\u00a0al., 1996; Jellali et\u00a0al., 2003; Tillman and Smith, 2005; Choi and Smith, 2005; Sorek et\u00a0al., 2008).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is identified as a chlorinated volatile organic compound (Cl-VOC) that contributes to widespread pollution problems in aquifers. The discussion highlights the degradation of PCE and its correlation with other degradation products, emphasizing its role as an organic chemical that poses environmental contamination risks. The relationship is framed within the broader category of organic chemicals, particularly those that are volatile and chlorinated, which are known to contaminate water sources.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and organic chemicals, as PCE is explicitly categorized as a Cl-VOC, indicating its relevance in environmental pollution discussions. The context provides evidence of its impact on aquifer contamination, supporting a clear relationship.",
