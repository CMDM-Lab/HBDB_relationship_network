    "context": "Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the injection technique was split/splitless. The GC-MS conditions are shown in Table 6. The results of the analyses of the samples have shown the presence of a number of VOCs in some water samples. Six VOCs, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, dichlorobromomethane, tetrachloroethylene and chlorodibromomethane were detected in water samples from four rivers and five lakes. Results of sample analyses are summarized in Table 7. Sampling was carried out seasonally, during the following months: June, October 1996, February, May, July, October 1997, March and June 1998. The values shown in the table indicate the range of concentrations during the period of sampling at four rivers and five lakes (June 1996\u2013June 1998). The concentrations of VOCs detected in the rivers were higher than in the lakes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in water samples from various rivers and lakes. The analysis indicates that this compound, along with others, was found in the water specimens, suggesting potential contamination of aquatic environments. However, there is no detailed discussion of the specific effects or interactions of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene with the water specimens beyond its presence as a detected contaminant.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is listed among VOCs found in water samples, indicating a general association with water contamination but lacking detailed interaction or significance.",
