    "context": "Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the injection technique was split/splitless. The GC-MS conditions are shown in Table 6. The results of the analyses of the samples have shown the presence of a number of VOCs in some water samples. Six VOCs, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, dichlorobromomethane, tetrachloroethylene and chlorodibromomethane were detected in water samples from four rivers and five lakes. Results of sample analyses are summarized in Table 7. Sampling was carried out seasonally, during the following months: June, October 1996, February, May, July, October 1997, March and June 1998. The values shown in the table indicate the range of concentrations during the period of sampling at four rivers and five lakes (June 1996\u2013June 1998). The concentrations of VOCs detected in the rivers were higher than in the lakes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and chlorodibromomethane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in water samples from various rivers and lakes. However, the context does not provide any specific information about their interactions, chemical properties, or any significant relationship beyond their co-occurrence in the same environmental study. They are simply listed among other VOCs without further elaboration on their relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are mentioned in the same study regarding VOC detection in water samples, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
