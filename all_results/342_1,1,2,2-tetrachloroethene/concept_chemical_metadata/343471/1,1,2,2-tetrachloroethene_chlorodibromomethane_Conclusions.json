    "context": "The presence of VOCs in lake Vegoritida may be attributed to effluents from electric power station, while VOCs detected in lake Small Prespa mainly derive from seasonal intense agricultural activities in the area nearby. However, the concentrations are lower than the regulation set by EC, except for trichloroethylene in river Axios during the second year of sampling. The occurrence of VOCs was studied in the surface waters of Northern Greece for a period of two years. The VOCs which have been detected are chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, dichlorobromomethane, tetrachloroethylene, and chlorodibromomethane. The concentrations of VOCs were higher in the rivers than in the lakes and especially at the borders than at the estuary. This is due to the possible transfer of VOCs from activities in the neighbouring countries. However the difference in the concentrations of rivers and lakes is not considerable. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and chlorodibromomethane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the surface waters of Northern Greece. However, the text does not provide any specific information about their relationship, interactions, or shared sources beyond their classification as VOCs present in the same environmental study. They are mentioned alongside other VOCs, but no direct connection is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs found in the same study area. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions, limiting their relevance.",
