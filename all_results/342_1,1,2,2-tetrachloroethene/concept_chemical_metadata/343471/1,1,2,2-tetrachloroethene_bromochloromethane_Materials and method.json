    "context": "The vials were carefully filled just to overflowing, without passing air bubbles through sample or trapping air bubbles in sealed vial. Preparation of vials included washing with detergent, rinsing with tap water, ultrapure water (Millipore: Milli-Ro 5 plus and Milli Q plus 185), acetone (Mallinckrodt Chemical Works St. Louis) and placing in an oven at 150\u00b0C for 2 h. HCl (4 drops 6 N/40 ml) was added to each water sample to prevent biodegradation and dehydrohalogenation (APHA, 1989). After sampling, the vials stored in the dark at temperatures between 0\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C, were carried by air to Mytilene for analysis in the Water Quality Laboratory at the Department of Environmental Studies of the University of the Aegean.Analytical procedure The following VOCs have been studied: chloroform (CHCl3), bromochloromethane (CH2ClBr), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), trichloroethylene (CHCCl3), dichlorobromomethane (CHCl2Br), 1,1,2-trichloroethane (Cl2CHCH2Cl), tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4), chlorodibromomethane (CHClBr2), 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane (ClCH2CCl3), bromoform (CHBr3), 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (Cl2CHCHCl2), hexachloro-1,3-butadine (Cl2CCClCClCCl2), and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (C6H3Cl3). VOCs presence has been determined by purge-and-trap (PAT) gas chromatographic (GC) method (APHA, 1992). The VOCs were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard Purge-and-Trap concentrator 7695 fitted with a 5-ml sample container and a 30 cm absorbent trap (Tenax/Silica Gel/Charcoal), a Hewlett Packard Gas Chromatograph 5890 Series II supported by a 63 Ni Electron Capture Detector (ECD). The PAT concentrator and the GC were supported by the HP G1909 PAT control software and the HP 3365 Chemstation System (Version A 02.01) software, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and bromochloromethane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in water samples using purge-and-trap gas chromatography. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions, toxicological effects, or any specific relationship beyond their inclusion in the same analytical procedure for VOC detection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are listed among the VOCs studied, indicating they belong to the same category but lacking any detailed interaction or functional relationship in the context provided.",
