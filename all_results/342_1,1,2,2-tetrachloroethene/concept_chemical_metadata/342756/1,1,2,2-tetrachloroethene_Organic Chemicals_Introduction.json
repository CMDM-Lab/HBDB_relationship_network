    "context": "VOCs were detected at trace levels (few ngm\u22123) and LODs obtained were clearly below legislated levels. So, it can be concluded that VERAM samplers are suitable tools to evaluate the air quality in the studied places and that the studied places are in good agreement with the mean tolerated threshold limit values of the time weighted average concentration of VOCs. Numerous laboratory tests have shown that, on an equal mass basis, nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) alone, NZVI doped with a catalyst metallic component such as palladium, and surface-modified NZVI such as iron\u2013carbon composites all exhibit greater reductive dechlorination rates for chlorinated hydrocarbons than does granular iron and their use may represent a promising approach for in situ contaminant treatment (Wang and Zhang, 1997; Lien and Zhang, 1999; Zhang, 2003; Liu et\u00a0al., 2005a,b; 2007; Song and Carraway, 2005, 2006; He and Zhao, 2005; Li et al., 2006; He et\u00a0al., 2007, 2009; Otto et\u00a0al., 2008; Cho and Choi, 2010; Zhan et\u00a0al., 2011). Consequently, there has been increasing interest in field applications of various NZVI materials to remediate groundwater resources contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) such as tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) (Elliott and Zhang, 2001; Quinn et\u00a0al., 2005; O'Hara et\u00a0al., 2006; Wei et\u00a0al., 2010; He et\u00a0al., 2010). Because NZVI particles are ferromagnetic they tend to aggregate in suspension (Schrick et\u00a0al., 2004; Nurmi et\u00a0al., 2005; Phenrat et\u00a0al., 2007) making them difficult to inject, which inhibits their field application (Hotze et\u00a0al., 2010). Recent research efforts have been made both in laboratory and field tests to increase NZVI colloidal stability by modifying NZVI surfaces with polymers thereby increasing their mobility in the subsurface once injected (Henn and Waddill, 2006; Vecchia et\u00a0al., 2009; Phenrat et\u00a0al., 2010a,b, 2011; Bennett et\u00a0al., 2010; He et\u00a0al., 2010; Sunkara et\u00a0al., 2010; Zhan et\u00a0al., 2011). Yet, detailed field tests are scarce that have evaluated changes in both contaminant concentration and mass flux over time. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (a chlorinated volatile organic compound) is mentioned as part of a discussion on the remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs). The text highlights the use of nanoscale zero valent iron (NZVI) for the treatment of such organic chemicals, indicating a direct relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the broader category of organic chemicals, particularly in the context of environmental remediation efforts.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and organic chemicals, as the context discusses its role as a CVOC targeted for remediation using NZVI. This relationship is supported by the mention of specific remediation strategies and the classification of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene within the category of organic chemicals.",
