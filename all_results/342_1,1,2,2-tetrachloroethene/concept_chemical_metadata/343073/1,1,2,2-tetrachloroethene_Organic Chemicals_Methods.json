    "context": "In addition to the clinical tests, the parents were asked to complete an anamnestic questionnaire. Children with known illnesses or on medication were excluded from the study. The study was authorised by the Ethics Committee of the University of Leipzig. Written informed consent was given by the parents of the children.Exposure monitoring 2.2.1 External exposure Twenty-seven VOC were measured outdoors and indoors (residences and Kindergarten) with main focus on region-specific chloro-organic compounds (tri- and tetrachloroethylene, TRI and TETRA), which are known to be liver toxins. The sample collection with passive sampling monitors (3M, Neuss, Germany) is described elsewhere (Rehwagen et al., 2003). The adsorbed substances were extracted with carbon disulphide and were determined by gas chromatography using an autosystem gas chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer, Berlin, Germany). A PVMS 54 capillary column (length 50m, diameter 0.32mm, thickness 1\u03bcm d f) was used for the analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the chloro-organic compounds being monitored for exposure, alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study focuses on the measurement of these organic chemicals, particularly their potential toxicity to the liver. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the broader category of organic chemicals is not elaborated upon beyond its classification as a VOC.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is categorized under organic chemicals, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or implications within the context provided.",
