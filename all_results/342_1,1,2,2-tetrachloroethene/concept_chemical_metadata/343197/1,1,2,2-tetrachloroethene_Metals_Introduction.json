    "context": "Solid phase microextraction (SPME), in which a fused-silica fiber coated with a stationary phase is used, has been applied to the analysis of environmental contaminant compounds in water, soil matrixes and, more recently, for the analysis of drug compounds in biological matrixes [17\u201320]. SPME has also been applied to the determination of some constituents, as acetone, ethanol and isoprene, in human breath [21\u201323]. In this work, the applicability of SPME to accomplish the biological monitoring of organic compounds in end-exhaled air has been studied. We have focused the study on tetrachloroethylene as a model compound\u2014a solvent used in dry-cleaning shops and in metal cleaning operations. The capacity of humans to metabolize tetrachloroethylene is limited. It is known that only 1\u20133% of the amount of tetrachloroethylene absorbed is metabolized to trichloroacetic acid by humans, the remaining being excreted unchanged in exhaled air. This fact turns tetrachloroethylene into a good model of respiratory elimination. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed as a solvent used in metal cleaning operations, indicating a potential relationship with metals. However, the focus is primarily on the analysis and biological monitoring of tetrachloroethene rather than a direct interaction with metals. The mention of metals is incidental to the discussion of tetrachloroethene's applications and metabolism.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is used in processes involving metals, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
