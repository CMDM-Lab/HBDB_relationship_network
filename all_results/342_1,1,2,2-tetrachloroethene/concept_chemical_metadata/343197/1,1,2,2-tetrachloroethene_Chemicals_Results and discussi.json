    "context": "The method detection limit was determined by analyzing test samples and multiplying the standard deviation of the mean by the appropriate Student\u2019s t-value for 99% confidence level with the appropriate degrees of freedom. The calculated value was 0.3 mg/m3 for eight replicates. Under the sampling and analytical conditions described here, tetrachloroethylene in exhaled air can be quantified at concentrations about 40 times lower than the biological exposure index proposed, for end-exhaled breath, by the ACGIH for this compound. So, the developed method permits both to monitor subjects who are exposed to low concentrations of tetrachloroethylene and to detect the accumulation of this chemical in fatty tissues by measuring the compound in exhaled breath some time after exposure has occurred. Single ion monitoring (SIM) can also be used to quantify the compound, thus notably improving the analytical results. The SIM acquisition can give, for example, a 20-fold increase in sensitivity. It must be pointed out that the use of mass spectrometry can be necessary in order to identify exhaled breath constituents for medical diagnostics or in occupational exposure to complex mixtures of compounds that can interact toxicologically.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed as a specific chemical that can be monitored in exhaled air to assess exposure levels. The text emphasizes the analytical methods developed for detecting this chemical, which is part of a broader category of chemicals that may pose health risks. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the detection and monitoring of this specific chemical rather than a detailed interaction with other chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is categorized under 'chemicals' and is discussed in the context of monitoring exposure. However, there is no detailed exploration of its relationship with other chemicals or a broader context of chemical interactions.",
