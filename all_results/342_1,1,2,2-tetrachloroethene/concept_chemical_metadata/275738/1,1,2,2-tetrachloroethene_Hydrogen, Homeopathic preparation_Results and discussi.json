    "context": "These variations of concentration ratios between the two areas (open cell and waste compaction) for the different VOCs stemming from waste assimilated with household waste clearly highlight the random nature of the corresponding emissions and emissions and their magnitude. Trichloroethylene was only detected once in the 6 samples. The presence of trichloroethylene, a solvent used for metal cleaning but partially prohibited because of its toxicity, can be explained by the degradation of tetrachloroethylene used for both dry cleaning and metal cleaning. Some authors assert that the biochemical breakdown of tetrachloroethylene, occurring via anaerobic hydrogen\u2013halogen substitution, can lead to the formation of trichloroethylene, both cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethene, and chloroethene. Older wastes can be brought back to the surface of the open cell by the activity of the compaction vehicle and thus to release the trichloroethylene formed as indicated below. Tetrachloroethylene was detected five times in the six samples and at relatively low concentrations in comparison to previous analyses. Other compounds were only detected and quantified near the compaction vehicles. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed in relation to its degradation process, which involves anaerobic hydrogen\u2013halogen substitution leading to the formation of other chlorinated compounds. However, there is no mention of hydrogen as a relevant factor in this degradation or any connection to homeopathic preparations. The terms appear without a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relevance between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and hydrogen, as well as homeopathic preparations. They are mentioned in the same context but do not interact or relate to each other in any meaningful way.",
