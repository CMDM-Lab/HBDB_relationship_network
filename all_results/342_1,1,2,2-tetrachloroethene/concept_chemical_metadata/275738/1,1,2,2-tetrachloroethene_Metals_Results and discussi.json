    "context": "However, if the results of the two areas are compared compound by compound, it can be seen, for example, that concentrations are 200 times higher for tetrachlorethylene next to the compaction vehicle (for the second sample) and 40 times higher for trichloromonofluoromethane next to the compaction vehicle (for the first sample) than at the open cell. These variations of concentration ratios between the two areas (open cell and waste compaction) for the different VOCs stemming from waste assimilated with household waste clearly highlight the random nature of the corresponding emissions and emissions and their magnitude. Trichloroethylene was only detected once in the 6 samples. The presence of trichloroethylene, a solvent used for metal cleaning but partially prohibited because of its toxicity, can be explained by the degradation of tetrachloroethylene used for both dry cleaning and metal cleaning. Some authors assert that the biochemical breakdown of tetrachloroethylene, occurring via anaerobic hydrogen\u2013halogen substitution, can lead to the formation of trichloroethylene, both cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethene, and chloroethene. Older wastes can be brought back to the surface of the open cell by the activity of the compaction vehicle and thus to release the trichloroethylene formed as indicated below. Tetrachloroethylene was detected five times in the six samples and at relatively low concentrations in comparison to previous analyses. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed in relation to its degradation products, particularly trichloroethylene, which is used for metal cleaning. The presence of tetrachloroethene and its breakdown products highlights their relevance in the context of metal cleaning processes. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the emissions and degradation rather than a direct interaction with metals themselves.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and metals, as the context discusses the solvent's use in metal cleaning and its degradation products. However, there is no detailed exploration of their direct relationship or interaction.",
