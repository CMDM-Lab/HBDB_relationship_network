The concentrations were on average 5\u201320 times higher next to the compaction vehicle than at the edge of the open cell. Temperature and wind also have an impact on the variation of VOC concentrations: increases in temperature increase the release of VOCs (higher concentrations obtained on May 23, at about 13:00h, due to the very high and rapid increase of temperature) while higher wind speeds favour their dispersion and thus dilution (measurements of April 7). The highest concentrations of VOCs in most of the measurements were obtained for: tetrachloroethylene, heptane, trichloroethylene, toluene and limonene. The results obtained show that, for the site studied, conformity with the time weighted average concentrations (TWA) established by INRS for occupational purposes was respected but it not necessary means absence of the health risks for workers. The method formulated must now be repeated at other periods and at other places at the same site, as well as other sites to obtain more in-depth characterisation of the general exposure of workers to VOCs in household waste storage installations. In addition, as these works are to be completed by a study of VOC dispersion outside the site, they will then be used not only as the basis for evaluating the health impact of VOCs on people working on landfill sites but also for the health risks for the surrounding population.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and heptanes are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high concentrations measured near a compaction vehicle. The study highlights the environmental impact of these VOCs, noting that their concentrations can vary significantly due to temperature and wind conditions. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or health implications in relation to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs and are mentioned in the same context regarding concentration measurements. However, there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions.",
