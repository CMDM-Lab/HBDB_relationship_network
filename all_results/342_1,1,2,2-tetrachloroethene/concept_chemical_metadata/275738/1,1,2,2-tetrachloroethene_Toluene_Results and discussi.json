    "context": "This could be explained by the fact that our measurements were performed very close to the source (open cell) and thus dilution with air was minimised. On the other hand, it is difficult to compare our results with the biogas values found by other authors, since they originate, via forced aspiration without dilution, from all the layers of the waste in the cells in operation and those that have been closed. This explains why the concentrations found in the biogas are higher than those of our results (e.g. maximum values of 225,000\u03bcg/m3 for tetrachloroethylene, 152,000\u03bcg/m3 for trichloroethylene, 287,000\u03bcg/m3 for toluene and limonene).Evaluation of VOC exposure concentrations for workers The measurements shown before permit evaluating the concentrations of pollutants to which the persons present on the site are exposed. This evaluation does not include the compaction vehicles themselves since the only persons present in this area are the drivers of the vehicles who operate in pressurised cabs supplied with air purified by an active carbon filter. This leaves the truck tipping area and the waste spreading area to be taken into account. The samples taken on May 23 in the truck tipping area and at the edge of the open cell were taken into account for this evaluation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with specific concentration measurements in a waste management setting. However, the text does not provide any direct interaction or relationship between the two compounds, merely listing their concentrations in the biogas without discussing their potential effects or interactions in the environment or on human health.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of VOC concentration measurements, but there is no discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
