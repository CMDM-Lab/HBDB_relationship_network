    "context": "For each solution five calibration points were used. The mixtures, prepared in methanol, EPA Mix 1A and EPA Mix 1B each had a concentration of 2000\u03bcg/mL for each compound. The mother solutions of 45.5mg/L (EPA Mix 1A) and 60.4mg/L (EPA Mix 1B) were prepared and then diluted to obtain, respectively, five daughter solutions of 23.6, 18.4, 13.1, 7.7 and 3.2mg/L (EPA Mix 1A) and 22.3, 17.2, 12, 6.5 and 3mg/L (EPA Mix 1B). The EPA Mix 1A solution contained benzene, ethylbenzene, heptane, heptene, methylethylbenzene, toluene, m, p and o-xylene compounds while the EPA Mix 1B solution contained 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,3-dichloropropane, chlorobenzene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, carbone tetrachloride, bromobenzene and 1,2-dibromoetane. Dilutions were made of the solution prepared by weighing in our laboratory, resulting in concentrations of 27.6, 18.5, 12.7, 5.8 and 3.7mg/L. This solution contained the following compounds: dodecane, undecane, decane, limonene, \u03b1 and \u03b2-pinene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, mesitylene, nonane and octane. As several calibrations of GCMS were performed during the whole study, the composition of our standard solution was completed at a later date by other compounds such as 2-butanone, 1-butanol, isopropanol and hexane.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and bromobenzenes are both mentioned as components of different EPA Mix solutions used for calibration in a study. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between these two compounds. They are simply part of a broader list of chemicals analyzed, with no specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the mixtures.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and bromobenzenes are merely listed in separate mixtures without any discussion of their interactions or significance in the context.",
        "score": 1
