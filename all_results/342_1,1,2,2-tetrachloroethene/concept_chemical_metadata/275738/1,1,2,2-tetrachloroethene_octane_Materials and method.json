    "context": "It was found that the relative standard deviation of the concentration for each target analyte was less than 10%. By the way, ASTM gives an uncertainty of about 15% for all the analytical chain, starting with the sampling by pre-concentration on sorbent tubes and ending with the GC\u2013MS analysis. The measurements of VOCs in the background air were also performed and clearly showed that the main source of VOC emissions is the open cell since the analyses carried out in the wind coming from the open cell (downwind) indicated the presence of VOCs, whereas those carried out in the background air (upwind of the landfill) indicated the absence of VOCs even at periphery of the site. The compounds investigated throughout the study were: heptane, octane, nonane, decane, undecane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-, p- and o-xylene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, mesitylene, \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene, and limonene. Fig. 1 shows a typical chromatogram (with the targeted VOCs) obtained for landfill gas sampled above an open cell. Choice of sampling flow Preliminary tests were performed on site, at the edge of an open cell, using 2 different sampling rates and the same sample volume/tube: (i) 1 sample was collected through the tube \u201cA\u201d with a flow rate of 0.083L/min during 120min (sampling volume of 9.97 L); (ii) 8 different samples were taken successively, and in parallel with the sampling on tube A, with a flow rate of 0.63L/min (sampling time/tube of 15min, an average sampling volume per tube of 9.84L) and a total time of 125min for the 8 samples. In this case (total time of 125min) an average concentration per compound was calculated with the 8 samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and octane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in the study of emissions from a landfill site. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or comparative significance in the context of the study. They are simply part of a broader list of compounds investigated for their presence in the air samples collected from the landfill.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and octane are mentioned together in the context of VOC analysis without any specific interaction or relevance discussed between them.",
