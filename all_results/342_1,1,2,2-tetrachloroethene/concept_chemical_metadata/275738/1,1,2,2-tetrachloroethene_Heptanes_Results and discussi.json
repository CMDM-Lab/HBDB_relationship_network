    "context": "Spreading mixes the sources of VOC emissions and thus \u201cdilutes\u201d strong concentrations. There was a peak concentration for toluene (7880\u03bcg/m3) from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in the area located next to the trucks tipping the waste and another peak concentration (8230\u03bcg/m3) from 12:37 p.m. to 1:37 p.m. at the edge of the open cell. This was probably due to the fact that the waste tipped by the trucks was spread mechanically over the surface of the open cell, approximately an hour after being tipped. The strongest concentrations (\u03bcg/m3), measured next to the trucks corresponded to the following VOCs: tetrachloroethylene (7320), toluene (7880), limonene (3270), m-xylene (2510), trichloroethylene (2470) heptane (1730), ethylbenzene (1340) and decane (1290). These are the compounds found most often at high concentrations, which is hardly surprising given that they are frequently used as solvents, cleaning and degreasing products, perfume additives, etc. By comparing the results obtained adjacent to the trucks and those obtained at the edge of the cell in operation, the same VOCs forming most of the emissions can be observed, highlighting that the emission was mostly due to fresh waste. 3.2.2.3 ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and heptanes are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected at high concentrations in the vicinity of waste tipping operations. They are part of a broader list of VOCs that are commonly used as solvents and are released during waste management activities. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships beyond their presence in the same environmental study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are listed among VOCs emitted during waste management, indicating they share a general category but lack a detailed or direct relationship in the context provided.",
