    "context": "The site was not licensed to accept toxic or industrial waste.VOC analysis procedure: quality assurance and control Desorption of VOCs trapped on sorbent tubes was carried out by sonication for 14min with benzene-free carbon bisulphide Fluka (#84713), in which n-bromododecane Fluka (#16270) was added as internal standard at a concentration of 21.19mg/L. The tubes were kept in the refrigerator for a maximum holding time of 24h before analysis. A carbon tube recovery test was performed, according to the procedure described in standard ISO 16200-1, by the addition on non-exposed sorbent tubes of 2\u03bcL of a solution at 4g/L in each of the compounds analysed. The recovery reached 100% for most of the compounds (heptane, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p,o-xylenes, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, mesitylene), while values different from 100% were 97% for limonene, 96% for \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene, 93% for octane, 90% for nonane, 86% for decane and 83% for undecane. The results presented take account of the different desorption rates. VOC analysis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 5890 gas chromatograph fitted with a 5973 mass selective detector. The GC capillary column used for all the analyses was a 60-m J&W DB-5MS (diphenyl copolymere (5%) and dimethyl (95%) siloxane) column, 1\u03bcm film thickness, 0.257mm i.d. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed during a quality assurance procedure for VOC analysis. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or significance in the context of the study. They are simply part of a list of compounds evaluated for recovery rates during the analysis process.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 4-xylene are only mentioned in the context of VOC analysis without any specific interaction or relevance to each other.",
