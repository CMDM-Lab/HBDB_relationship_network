    "context": "These variations of concentration ratios between the two areas (open cell and waste compaction) for the different VOCs stemming from waste assimilated with household waste clearly highlight the random nature of the corresponding emissions and emissions and their magnitude. Trichloroethylene was only detected once in the 6 samples. The presence of trichloroethylene, a solvent used for metal cleaning but partially prohibited because of its toxicity, can be explained by the degradation of tetrachloroethylene used for both dry cleaning and metal cleaning. Some authors assert that the biochemical breakdown of tetrachloroethylene, occurring via anaerobic hydrogen\u2013halogen substitution, can lead to the formation of trichloroethylene, both cis- and trans-1,2-dichloroethene, and chloroethene. Older wastes can be brought back to the surface of the open cell by the activity of the compaction vehicle and thus to release the trichloroethylene formed as indicated below. Tetrachloroethylene was detected five times in the six samples and at relatively low concentrations in comparison to previous analyses. Other compounds were only detected and quantified near the compaction vehicles. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a compound that can degrade into trichloroethylene through biochemical processes involving halogens. The relationship highlights the role of halogens in the degradation pathways of chlorinated solvents, indicating that halogens are integral to the chemical behavior and transformation of tetrachloroethene. However, the discussion does not delve deeply into the specific interactions or mechanisms involving halogens beyond their role in the degradation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is linked to halogens through its degradation process, but the context lacks detailed exploration of their interaction or significance beyond this biochemical pathway.",
