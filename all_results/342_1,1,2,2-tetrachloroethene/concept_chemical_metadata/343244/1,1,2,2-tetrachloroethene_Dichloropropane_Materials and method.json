    "context": "Their performance was checked using actual uncensored data sets from the monitoring study. Statistics of interest included the mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range. General Surface waters were sampled twice a year in the Channel, the Belgian continental shelf, the southern North Sea and the Scheldt estuary during a 3-year monitoring study (April 1998 to October 2000) to determine concentration levels of 27 priority VOCs. The analytes of interest included 1,1-dichloroethene (DCE11), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), trans-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE12), 1,1-dichloroethane (DCA11), chloroform (CHCl3), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TRI111), cyclohexane (CYCLO), tetrachloromethane (CCl4), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA12), benzene (BENZ), trichloroethene (TCE), 1,2-dichloropropane (DCP12), toluene (TOL), 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TRI112), tetrachloroethene (PCE), chlorobenzene (ClBENZ), ethylbenzene (EtBENZ), m- and p-xylene (MPXYL), o-xylene (OXYL), 1,3-dichlorobenzene (DCB13), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB14), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB12), 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB135), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB124), hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCB) and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (TCB123). As a result, 47 marine and 84 estuarine water samples were analysed by purge-and-trap combined with high resolution gas chromatography and detection by mass spectrometry operating in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Data were produced by analyses deemed \u201cin control\u201d by a rigorous quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program. Measurements were grouped into two multivariate data sets, one labeled as \u201cNorth Sea\u201d, the other as \u201cScheldt estuary\u201d. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and dichloropropane are both mentioned as part of a broader study analyzing concentrations of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in surface waters. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the list of analytes monitored during the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as both compounds are simply listed among many others in a monitoring study without any indication of interaction or relevance to each other.",
