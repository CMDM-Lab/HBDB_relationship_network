    "context": "[10] Similarly, VOCs shifted the half-maximal voltage of steady-state inactivation (V1/2, inact) from approximately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 mV in control to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c32, \u00e2\u20ac\u201c35, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 mV in the presence of TOL, TCE, and PERC, respectively. [11] Inhibition of ICa by TOL was confirmed in primary cultures of cortical neurons, where 827 \u00ce\u00bcM TOL inhibited current by 61%. [12] These data demonstrate that VOCs perturb voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel function in neurons, an effect that could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of these compounds. [1] Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as toluene (TOL), 1,1,1-trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene; PERC), are widely used as paint-thinners, industrial degreasing agents, and dry-cleaning agents. [2] Acute exposure to sufficient concentrations of these compounds results in behavioral and neurological deficits, characterized by biphasic changes in locomotor activity , psychomotor impairment , incoordination, sedation , and alterations in cognitive ability (; ). [3] The mechanism(s) underlying the acute effects of these and other VOCs is not well understood and generally has received little attention. [1] VOCs share many effects with CNS depressant compounds, such as ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and volatile anesthetics (for review, see ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of organic chemicals. The text discusses the neurotoxic effects of various VOCs, including PERC, highlighting their common usage in industrial applications. However, the specific relationship between PERC and the general category of organic chemicals is not elaborated upon beyond its classification as a VOC.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is categorized as an organic chemical, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or implications within the broader category.",
