    "context": " [8] Specifically, the abilities of TCE and PERC to inhibit VSCC function were examined, and the interactions of TOL, TCE, and PERC with VSCC function in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were characterized.  [9] This included examining the reversibility of VOC effects, concentration-response relationships, and VOC effects on steady-state activation and inactivation. [10] Finally, because PC12 cells are a clonal cell line, the sensitivity of neuronal VSCCs to VOCs was confirmed by examining TOL inhibition of calcium current (ICa) in primary cultures of cortical cells. [1] Toluene (99.5% purity), 1,1,1-trichloroethylene (99.5% purity), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene (99.5% purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). [2] Toluene solutions were prepared immediately before use by addition of TOL to extracellular solution (see below) followed by vigorous shaking in a Teflon-capped vial. [3] Solutions of TCE and PERC were prepared by the addition of these solvents to extracellular solution followed by sonication in a water bath for several minutes. [4] In all of the cases, solutions were prepared immediately before use, the amount of headspace in the containers was minimized, and the total volume of solvent added did not exceed 0.05% of the volume of extracellular solution (see below).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and toluene (TOL) are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) examined for their effects on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. The study investigates the interactions of these VOCs with VSCC function, including their inhibitory effects on calcium currents. While both compounds are part of the same experimental setup, the specific relationship between them is not deeply explored beyond their shared role in affecting cellular function.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are studied together for their effects on VSCC function, indicating some level of interaction. However, the context does not provide detailed insights into their specific relationship or comparative effects.",
