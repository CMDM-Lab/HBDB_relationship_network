    "context": " [8] Specifically, the abilities of TCE and PERC to inhibit VSCC function were examined, and the interactions of TOL, TCE, and PERC with VSCC function in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells were characterized.  [9] This included examining the reversibility of VOC effects, concentration-response relationships, and VOC effects on steady-state activation and inactivation. [10] Finally, because PC12 cells are a clonal cell line, the sensitivity of neuronal VSCCs to VOCs was confirmed by examining TOL inhibition of calcium current (ICa) in primary cultures of cortical cells. [1] Toluene (99.5% purity), 1,1,1-trichloroethylene (99.5% purity), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene (99.5% purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). [2] Toluene solutions were prepared immediately before use by addition of TOL to extracellular solution (see below) followed by vigorous shaking in a Teflon-capped vial. [3] Solutions of TCE and PERC were prepared by the addition of these solvents to extracellular solution followed by sonication in a water bath for several minutes. [4] In all of the cases, solutions were prepared immediately before use, the amount of headspace in the containers was minimized, and the total volume of solvent added did not exceed 0.05% of the volume of extracellular solution (see below).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (TCE) is mentioned alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like toluene and perchloroethylene (PERC) in relation to their effects on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in PC12 cells. However, 2-naphthylethyl methacrylate is not discussed or linked to TCE or the study's focus on VOC interactions with VSCC function. Therefore, there is no direct relationship established between these two compounds in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 2-naphthylethyl methacrylate are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their relationship or relevance to each other.",
