    "context": "[10] Similarly, VOCs shifted the half-maximal voltage of steady-state inactivation (V1/2, inact) from approximately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 mV in control to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c32, \u00e2\u20ac\u201c35, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 mV in the presence of TOL, TCE, and PERC, respectively. [11] Inhibition of ICa by TOL was confirmed in primary cultures of cortical neurons, where 827 \u00ce\u00bcM TOL inhibited current by 61%. [12] These data demonstrate that VOCs perturb voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel function in neurons, an effect that could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of these compounds. [1] Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as toluene (TOL), 1,1,1-trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene; PERC), are widely used as paint-thinners, industrial degreasing agents, and dry-cleaning agents. [2] Acute exposure to sufficient concentrations of these compounds results in behavioral and neurological deficits, characterized by biphasic changes in locomotor activity , psychomotor impairment , incoordination, sedation , and alterations in cognitive ability (; ). [3] The mechanism(s) underlying the acute effects of these and other VOCs is not well understood and generally has received little attention. [1] VOCs share many effects with CNS depressant compounds, such as ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and volatile anesthetics (for review, see ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 2-naphthylethyl methacrylate are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can affect neuronal function. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships. The focus is primarily on the neurotoxic effects of VOCs in general, without detailing how these two compounds relate to each other in terms of mechanism or impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 2-naphthylethyl methacrylate, as they are only mentioned in the broader context of VOCs affecting neuronal function without any specific interaction or relevance to each other.",
