    "context": "[10] Similarly, VOCs shifted the half-maximal voltage of steady-state inactivation (V1/2, inact) from approximately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c16 mV in control to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c32, \u00e2\u20ac\u201c35, and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c20 mV in the presence of TOL, TCE, and PERC, respectively. [11] Inhibition of ICa by TOL was confirmed in primary cultures of cortical neurons, where 827 \u00ce\u00bcM TOL inhibited current by 61%. [12] These data demonstrate that VOCs perturb voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel function in neurons, an effect that could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of these compounds. [1] Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as toluene (TOL), 1,1,1-trichloroethylene (TCE), and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene; PERC), are widely used as paint-thinners, industrial degreasing agents, and dry-cleaning agents. [2] Acute exposure to sufficient concentrations of these compounds results in behavioral and neurological deficits, characterized by biphasic changes in locomotor activity , psychomotor impairment , incoordination, sedation , and alterations in cognitive ability (; ). [3] The mechanism(s) underlying the acute effects of these and other VOCs is not well understood and generally has received little attention. [1] VOCs share many effects with CNS depressant compounds, such as ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and volatile anesthetics (for review, see ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and toluene (TOL) are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit neurotoxic effects when exposed to sufficient concentrations. The study highlights how these VOCs can disrupt voltage-sensitive calcium channel function in neurons, contributing to acute neurotoxicity. However, while they are mentioned together in the context of their effects on the central nervous system, the specific relationship between PERC and TOL is not deeply explored beyond their shared classification and neurotoxic potential.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in relation to their neurotoxic effects as VOCs, but there is no detailed interaction or comparison provided between them.",
