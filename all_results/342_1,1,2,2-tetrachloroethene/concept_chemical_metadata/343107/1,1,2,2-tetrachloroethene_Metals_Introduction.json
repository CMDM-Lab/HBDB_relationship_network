    "context": "[2] The present data support the hypothesis that effects on VSCC could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of VOCs. [3] By incorporating such information into models for solvent neurotoxicity , the scientific basis for predicting the risks associated with exposure to these and possibly other VOCs will be improved. Introduction Toluene (TOL) and perchloroethylene (PERC) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) widely used in industrial products and processes. Briefly, PERC has been used in dry cleaning and metal degreasing processes and TOL is commonly found in paints, paint thinners, and gasoline sources. Effects of these VOCs on function of the central nervous system (CNS) are of great interest due to their widespread use and exposure potential. For both compounds, inhalation is the typical route of human exposure, although they can be absorbed dermally and in some cases ingested (for reviews, see Arlien-Soborg, 1992; \u00d8stergaard, 2000). Based on similarities in their adverse behavioral effects, it is hypothesized that VOCs disrupt nervous system function via common mechanisms (for a review, see Balster, 1998). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) used in industrial applications, particularly in dry cleaning and metal degreasing. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with metals. While metals may be involved in processes where PERC is used, the context does not provide specific interactions or implications regarding their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both PERC and metals are mentioned in the context of industrial applications, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
