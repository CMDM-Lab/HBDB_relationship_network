    "context": "[1] In summary, the present results have demonstrated that TOL, TCE, and PERC inhibit VSCC in a manner similar to volatile anesthetics and at concentrations that are consistent with brain levels of VOCs that result in behavorial alterations. [2] The present data support the hypothesis that effects on VSCC could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of VOCs. [3] By incorporating such information into models for solvent neurotoxicity , the scientific basis for predicting the risks associated with exposure to these and possibly other VOCs will be improved. Introduction Toluene (TOL) and perchloroethylene (PERC) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) widely used in industrial products and processes. Briefly, PERC has been used in dry cleaning and metal degreasing processes and TOL is commonly found in paints, paint thinners, and gasoline sources. Effects of these VOCs on function of the central nervous system (CNS) are of great interest due to their widespread use and exposure potential. For both compounds, inhalation is the typical route of human exposure, although they can be absorbed dermally and in some cases ingested (for reviews, see Arlien-Soborg, 1992; \u00d8stergaard, 2000).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and toluene (TOL) are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that inhibit voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in a manner similar to volatile anesthetics. The study suggests that their effects on VSCC may contribute to the neurotoxicity associated with VOC exposure, highlighting their relevance in understanding the risks of solvent exposure and its impact on the central nervous system (CNS).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between PERC and TOL, as both are discussed in relation to their neurotoxic effects on VSCC, supported by evidence of their behavioral alterations. This indicates a clear relationship within the context of VOC exposure and CNS function.",
