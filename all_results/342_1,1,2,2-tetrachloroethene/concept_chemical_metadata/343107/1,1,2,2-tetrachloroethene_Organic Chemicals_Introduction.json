    "context": "[1] In summary, the present results have demonstrated that TOL, TCE, and PERC inhibit VSCC in a manner similar to volatile anesthetics and at concentrations that are consistent with brain levels of VOCs that result in behavorial alterations. [2] The present data support the hypothesis that effects on VSCC could contribute to the acute neurotoxicity of VOCs. [3] By incorporating such information into models for solvent neurotoxicity , the scientific basis for predicting the risks associated with exposure to these and possibly other VOCs will be improved. Introduction Toluene (TOL) and perchloroethylene (PERC) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) widely used in industrial products and processes. Briefly, PERC has been used in dry cleaning and metal degreasing processes and TOL is commonly found in paints, paint thinners, and gasoline sources. Effects of these VOCs on function of the central nervous system (CNS) are of great interest due to their widespread use and exposure potential. For both compounds, inhalation is the typical route of human exposure, although they can be absorbed dermally and in some cases ingested (for reviews, see Arlien-Soborg, 1992; \u00d8stergaard, 2000).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of organic chemicals. The discussion focuses on the neurotoxic effects of various VOCs, including PERC, and their implications for human health, particularly regarding exposure risks. While PERC is mentioned as an organic chemical, the relationship is primarily categorical rather than specific, as the context does not delve into unique interactions or properties of PERC compared to other organic chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is categorized as an organic chemical, but the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific relevance beyond this classification.",
