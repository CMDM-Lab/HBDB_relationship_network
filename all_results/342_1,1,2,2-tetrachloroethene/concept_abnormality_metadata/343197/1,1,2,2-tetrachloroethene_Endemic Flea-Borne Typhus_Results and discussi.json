    "context": "Results of overall uncertainty of the measuring procedures are also showed in Table 4. Overall uncertainty is expressed, on a relative basis, by a combination of bias and precision. Results for the proposed method and the comparison method are similar. The overall uncertainty was also similar to the NIOSH method for tetrachloroethylene in exhaled breath by a portable GC. The sampling and SPME method, as described here, was applied to tetrachloroethylene determination from exhaled breath samples of an occupationally exposed subject in a cleaning shop. Unlike other alveolar breath collection devices, the worker does not need special training to provide end-expired air samples and even the sample can be collected by the worker himself. Fig. 3 illustrates the chromatograms obtained with samples collected before and after a typical exposure on the third day of the week. The time required to perform the complete sampling procedure and analysis described is less than 11 min, which is lower than that required using S2C or thermal desorption methods. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned in relation to a method for measuring its presence in exhaled breath samples of an occupationally exposed individual. However, there is no discussion or evidence linking 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect relationship established.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, as they are mentioned in unrelated contexts without any discussion of their interaction or significance.",
