    "context": "Solid phase microextraction (SPME), in which a fused-silica fiber coated with a stationary phase is used, has been applied to the analysis of environmental contaminant compounds in water, soil matrixes and, more recently, for the analysis of drug compounds in biological matrixes [17\u201320]. SPME has also been applied to the determination of some constituents, as acetone, ethanol and isoprene, in human breath [21\u201323]. In this work, the applicability of SPME to accomplish the biological monitoring of organic compounds in end-exhaled air has been studied. We have focused the study on tetrachloroethylene as a model compound\u2014a solvent used in dry-cleaning shops and in metal cleaning operations. The capacity of humans to metabolize tetrachloroethylene is limited. It is known that only 1\u20133% of the amount of tetrachloroethylene absorbed is metabolized to trichloroacetic acid by humans, the remaining being excreted unchanged in exhaled air. This fact turns tetrachloroethylene into a good model of respiratory elimination. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed primarily as a model compound for studying environmental contaminants and their metabolic processes in humans. However, there is no mention or connection to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, which is a disease caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in the same context but lack any direct or indirect relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects the absence of any relevant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus. They are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
