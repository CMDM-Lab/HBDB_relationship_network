    "context": "The relatively high contaminant mass reductions of the SIVS system combined with the associated low capital costs and maintenance make the system ideal for use as a long-term reactive barrier at chlorinated solvent release sites. However, it must be noted that this study was limited by the calibration results of only one pilot study and measurements of the potential radius of influence were not included. Future studies should examine the behavior of the induced groundwater circulation via mathematical modeling and field studies to define and optimize the radius of influence. Perchloroethylene (PCE or PERC) also called tetrachloroethylene, is a volatile, nonflammable, and colorless liquid with a sweet odor. It has been commercially available since the early 1900s and is now one of the most widely used chlorinated solvents worldwide. It is the solvent of choice in dry cleaning facilities. In 1994 its usage in this industry reached 90% within the European Union. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a chlorinated solvent, specifically in relation to its use in dry cleaning. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding Sweet's Syndrome, which is a rare skin condition characterized by fever and painful skin lesions. The context does not provide any evidence or indication that 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is related to or impacts Sweet's Syndrome in any way.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Sweet's Syndrome, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or significance.",
