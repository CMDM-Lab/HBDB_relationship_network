    "context": "For each desorption time and temperature, the lowest levels that caused the highest peak responses were selected as the preferred values. The percentage of carryover also depends on desorption time and temperature therefore these GC parameters should be selected so that quantitative desorption occurs with the least amount of carryover. To select the optimum desorption time and temperature, carryover and possible memory effect were investigated in a second desorption cycle two minutes after the first. For desorption times ranging from 1 to 4min, the peak area acquired in the second desorption process was plotted as the amount of carryover accrued and the resulting graph was used to determine the optimum time required for conditioning the NTD between sampling cycles.Field sampling by NTDs packed with nanoplatelets graphene After optimizing all aspects of NTD sampling in the laboratory, NTDs packed with graphene nanoplatelets were used to determine the concentration of perchloroethylene in a dry-cleaning shop. This was done by connecting NTDs to calibrated low-volume personal sampling pumps. Sampling flow rates of 3mL/min and sampling volumes of 30mL were used. These sampling sets were attached to workers in the respiratory zone of the dry-cleaning shop to estimate their exposure to PCE.Method validation and comparative study Validation of the NTD technique was performed under the optimized conditions determined previously in this study for the quantitative analysis of the target compound in a standard chamber.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned in relation to air sampling techniques used to assess exposure levels in a dry-cleaning environment. However, there is no discussion or evidence linking PCE to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, which is a disease caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, as they are mentioned in unrelated contexts with no evidence of interaction or relevance.",
