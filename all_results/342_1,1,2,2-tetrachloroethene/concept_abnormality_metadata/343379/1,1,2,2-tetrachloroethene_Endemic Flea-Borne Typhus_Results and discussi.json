    "context": "In contrast, the solvent-less NTD technique enables the total mass of analytes to be delivered without losses resulting in more accurate concentration readings. The results for the comparative field study are shown in  Tables 2 and 3.Field sampling of PCE in dry cleaning Additionally to technique comparison, field sampling was also performed to monitor the levels of PCE in a work environment. The aim was to test an inexpensive and rapid method for sampling VOCs and HVOCs in air. Perchloroethylene was selected as a representative compound of the HVOC group and a dry-cleaning shop was chosen as an appropriate work environment in which to monitor the occupational exposure to PCE. Sampling was done at five stations in the shop\u05f3s respiratory zone using NTD, SPME and NIOSH 1003 techniques. One sampling station was located in the reception, three more were placed 1, 2 and 5m from the washing machine and a 5th station was located in the ironing room. The results demonstrated that NTD and SPME had smaller variations in responses compared to the NIOSH 1003 technique which had a greater RSD. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is discussed primarily in relation to its monitoring in a dry-cleaning environment as a volatile organic compound (VOC). There is no mention or implication of a relationship between PCE and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, which is a disease caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, as they are mentioned in unrelated contexts with no discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
