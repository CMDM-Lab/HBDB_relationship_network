    "context": "So, it can be seen that VERAM samplers are able to catch and release pollutants as a function of increases or decreases of the pollutant concentrations in the indoor air, reflecting thus the average concentration of VOCs in the air during the sampling period. Samplers deployed during 15 days confirm the aforementioned situation and evidenced that results obtained for this sampling time were comparable with those found after 72 and 96h. On the other hand, samplers deployed during 8h workday show concentration values below TLV-TWA legislated levels. Fig. 5 also shows that the VOCs present in a car repair shop are practically the same than those measured in the motorbike repair shop except for tetrachloroethene in the warehouse for which concentrations from 1000 to 3000ngVERAM\u22121 were found for long deployment times and 75ngVERAM\u22121 for a sampling period of 8h. This compound is commonly used to clean the motor engines and motor pieces and thus it is not surprising that the concentrations found in the working area could be three orders of magnitude lower than those found in the warehouse. The equilibrium concentration of detected VOCs in the air was calculated from the amount of VOCs found in VERAM samplers combined with uptake parameters (K\u2032SA and R s) obtained from previous studies at 25\u00b0C. In fact the temperature in the sampling sites was 25\u00b13\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) found in a car repair shop, where it is used for cleaning motor engines. However, there is no discussion or evidence linking this compound to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, a disease transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect relationship established between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus are mentioned in the same context but without any relevant connection or interaction discussed.",
