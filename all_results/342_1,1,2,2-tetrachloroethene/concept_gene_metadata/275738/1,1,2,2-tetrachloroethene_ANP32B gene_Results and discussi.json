    "context": "For these measurements, the sampling locations were much closer to the upper layer of waste than those of the other measurements, thereby explaining the high concentration measurements. The results are synthesised in Figs. 3 and 4 , respectively. A continuous layout was selected to connect distinct points as it highlights variations of VOC concentrations more clearly. Fig. 3 (measurements of April 7) shows the evolution of VOC concentrations which appear close for all compounds, with three high peaks of concentrations at about 11 p.m. and 11:50 p.m. for tetrachloroethylene, heptane and toluene. These concentrations can be explained by the arrival of trucks loaded with waste containing these compounds and by intensive compaction vehicles activity which stirred up the waste. The VOC emissions (type and quantity) vary as a function of the origin of the waste, especially in the case of a dump taking in household waste as well as standard industrial and commercial waste, as in the case of the site studied. Since the temperatures on April 7 were low with constant atmospheric pressure, the main parameters liable to influence the evolution of concentrations of VOCs and the diffusion of the latter into the atmosphere were the activities of the trucks unloading and waste compaction vehicles and the wind speed.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) detected in high concentrations due to waste management activities. However, there is no mention or discussion of the ANP32B gene, which is unrelated to the VOCs or the environmental context provided. Thus, there is no established relationship between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the ANP32B gene, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any interaction or relationship discussed.",
