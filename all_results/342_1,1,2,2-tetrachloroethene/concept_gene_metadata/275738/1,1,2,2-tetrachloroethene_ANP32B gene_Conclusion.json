    "context": "We chose relatively stable atmospheric conditions for all the measurements (no rainfall and almost constant pressure, wind force and direction during the sampling) and distances of several meters between the sampling point and the layer of waste. These restrictions obviously limited the sampling sequences and their duration, but this was the necessary condition for obtaining information on these emissions. The pollution peaks observed for certain compounds in two series of measurements carried out at the edge of an open cell (May 23 and April 7) appear to be caused by variations in the nature of the loads in the trucks transporting the waste. Tetrachloroethylene and heptane were observed with maximum concentrations of 2990 and 2480\u03bcg/m3, respectively, in the area of the open cell during the morning of April 7 and of 9810 and 3680\u03bcg/m3, respectively, during the morning of May 23. The high concentrations of these compounds in the waste unloaded are also linked to conditions favouring their emission and minimising their dispersion (i.e. low distance between the sampling location and the upper layer of waste due to the cell-filling level). Most VOCs were measured at greater concentrations in the truck unloading waste area compared to the open cell. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) observed in high concentrations during waste unloading, while the ANP32B gene is not discussed or linked to any specific biological or chemical processes related to the emissions of VOCs. There is no direct or indirect relationship established between the two terms in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the ANP32B gene, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
