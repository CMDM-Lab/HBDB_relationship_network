    "context": "However, for others it is attributed to industrial contamination during the MF/RO process, or formation during chloramination. For most VOCs, RO treatment efficiency was higher than overall MF/RO treatment efficiency, however more analysis of VOCs before and after RO treatment is recommended to better characterise the RO treatment variability. Management of risks in IPR is dependent on advanced treatment technologies and comprehensive risk management approaches to ensure compliance with drinking water guidelines. Frequent monitoring of a treatment performance indicator such as 1,4-dichlorobenzene (in conjunction with the continuous online monitoring of critical control points) during the MF/RO treatment process is likely to be sufficient to ensure adequate removal of VOCs. If successful, this approach has the potential for significantly reducing the analytical costs and complexity of monitoring water treatment systems performance for removal of VOCs, and other chemical groups. Since its introduction in the early 1970s, solid-phase extraction (SPE) has become the method of choice in analytical laboratories for either sample extraction or sample clean up procedures of liquid solutions. Typical applications include methods for determination of trace of amount of pesticides, determination of trace of organic compounds in water, isolation of organic compounds from different matrices such as wine or urine and blood.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is highlighted as a treatment performance indicator during the microfiltration/reverse osmosis (MF/RO) process for removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from water. The monitoring of 1,4-dichlorobenzene levels is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the MF/RO treatment process, indicating its direct relevance to the operational procedures and risk management in water treatment technologies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,4-dichlorobenzene and the MF/RO process, as it serves as a key performance indicator for monitoring treatment efficiency. The context provides evidence of its importance in ensuring compliance with drinking water guidelines.",
