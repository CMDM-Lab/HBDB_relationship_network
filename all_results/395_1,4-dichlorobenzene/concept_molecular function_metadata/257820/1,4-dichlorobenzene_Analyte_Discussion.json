    "context": "The rejection of VOCs in a range of different RO membranes has been reported as highly variable. For some VOCs (1,1,1-trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, p-, m- and o-xylenes, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene), rejection has been reported as higher than 90% (Agenson et\u00a0al., 2003), but for other VOCs rejection has been reported as much lower (e.g. 6\u201354% for benzene). Using paired post-MF and post-RO samples, 56% of analytes in this study had rejection efficiency greater than 80% \u2013 including 1,4-dichlorobenzene (87%), while 37% had rejection efficiency greater than 90%. Lower median rejection was associated with benzene (56%), bromomethane (48%) and styrene (63%). It has been found that rejection of VOCs is influenced by solute size, molecular charge, branching of functional groups and Kow (Agenson et\u00a0al., 2003). VOCs with poorer rejection usually have smaller molecular width and length, and lower Kow. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is identified as an analyte whose rejection efficiency in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes is evaluated. The study reports that 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a rejection efficiency of 87%, indicating its significance as a target analyte in assessing the performance of RO membranes for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship is established through quantitative data on rejection rates, highlighting the importance of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in the context of VOC removal processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,4-dichlorobenzene and the term 'analyte', as the study provides quantitative data on its rejection efficiency in RO membranes, indicating its relevance in the analysis of VOCs. However, the context does not delve into deeper interactions or implications.",
