    "context": "Results have already been reported which describe the occurrence of priority VOCs in the southern North Sea. In this work, we present our findings on VOC levels in the Scheldt estuary. For this, the occurrence and spatial-temporal variability of priority CHCs, MAHs and CMAHs were studied along the trajectory Vlissingen (the Netherlands)\u2014Temse (Belgium) during a 3-year monitoring survey, from May 1998 till November 2000. Analytes The following VOCs were selected from the \u2018List of Priority Hazardous Substances\u2019 and \u2018Reference List of Substances\u2019 established at the 3rd International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea: 1,1-dichloroethene (DCE11), trans-1,2-dichloroethene (tDCE12), 1,1-dichloroethane (DCA11), chloroform (CHCl3), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TRI111), tetrachloromethane (CCl4), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA12), trichloroethene (TCE), 1,2-dichloropropane (DCP12), 1,1,2-trichloroethane (TRI112), tetrachloroethene (PCE), hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (HCB), cyclohexane (CYCLO), toluene (TOL), ethylbenzene (EtBENZ), m/p-xylene (MPXYL), o-xylene (OXYL), chlorobenzene (ClBENZ), 1,3-dichlorobenzene (DCB13), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB14), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB12), 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB135), 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB124) and 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene (TCB123).Sampling Water samples were taken over the period 1998\u20132000 on board the Dutch research vessel \u2018Luctor\u2019 from the \u2018NIOO (Nederlands Instituut voor Oecologisch Onderzoek)\u2019, Yerseke, the Netherlands at fourteen stations located along the trajectory Vlissingen\u2014Temse. The sampling stations are shown in Fig. 1. Campaigns were conducted in May 1998, October 1998, May 1999, November 1999, April 2000 and November 2000. Hence, the survey provided a data set of 84 samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) included in a study of priority hazardous substances in the southern North Sea. They are part of a broader list of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) monitored over a three-year period. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions, properties, or significance relative to each other within the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are listed among priority VOCs in the same study, indicating they belong to a similar category of substances. However, there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions.",
