    "context": "Because neither a change in concentration of the main contaminants, nor the quality of the bacteria, or the groundwater ions, was seen to be the reason for the measured toxic effects, questions arouse about the origin of the contaminants to be toxic to the bacteria. As toxic substances might increase or decrease their effect in combination with each other (Faust et al., 2000a,b), the bacterial toxicity of the six quantitatively dominating contaminants in the SAFIRA groundwater was analysed. Single dose response curves for each substance were generated. Quadruplicates for each tested concentration were analysed and EC50 of 2-chlorotoluene, 1,2- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, ethylenbenzene, monochlorobenzene and benzene were calculated (see Table 1 and Fig. 4 ). The resulting dose response relationships of each compound were used to calculate the expected combined effect in a mixture. This was done on the basis of the concentration addition concept. For comparison the appropriate groundwater (i.e. containing the same concentrations of contaminants as the calculated mixture) was serially diluted with tap water (Fig. 5 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene are both mentioned as contaminants analyzed for their bacterial toxicity in groundwater. The study focuses on the dose-response relationships of various chlorinated compounds, including 1,4-dichlorobenzene and monochlorobenzene, to assess their combined toxic effects. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative toxicity within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are part of a broader analysis of contaminants affecting bacterial toxicity, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or explored beyond their inclusion in the same study.",
