    "context": "The solution was titrated with NaOH (1M) to pH 7.0 (pH 7.2 for liquid culture) and autoclaved. The chemicals for the positive controls (3,5-dichlorophenol und zinc sulfate) and for the synthetic groundwater were all of reagent grade and purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) and Merck, respectively. The artificial groundwater included the following chemicals based on the chemical analyses of the groundwater at the SAFIRA pilot plant in Bitterfeld: KCl (3.77mM), MgCl2 (3.56mM), NaHCO3 (3.4mM), CaSO4 (5mM), NH4Cl (0.45mM). Standards for calibration of the headspace-GC (see below) and for the generating of single dose response relationships were prepared from the following volatile chemicals: benzene (CAS RN 71-43-2), 2-chlorotoluene (CAS RN 95-49-8), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (CAS RN 95-50-1), ethylbenzene (CAS RN 100-41-4), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (CAS RN 106-46-7), monochlorobenzene (CAS RN 108-90-7). All chemicals were purchased from Merck (except 2-chlorotoluene- Riedel-de-Haen, Seelze, Germany) and were of analytical grade.Bacteria Luminescent bacteria (V. fischeri) were cultivated according to ISO 11348-1 (Anonymous, 1998) and aliquots from the plated culture were stored in medium containing 25% glycerol (v/v) at \u221280\u00b0C for a maximum of three months. One ml of these aliquots served as inoculation for the freshly prepared bacteria culture (50ml) which was weekly renewed in the biomonitor. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mentioned as one of the volatile chemicals included in the preparation of standards for calibration in a headspace gas chromatography analysis. It is categorized as a chemical alongside other compounds like benzene and ethylbenzene, indicating its role in the broader context of chemical analysis but lacking specific interactions or implications regarding its properties or effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,4-dichlorobenzene is simply listed among other chemicals used for calibration without any detailed discussion of its specific properties, interactions, or significance in the context provided.",
