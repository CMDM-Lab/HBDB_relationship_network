    "context": "In addition, males have a higher risk level than females. This may be due to working males spending more time in the office and commuting, where elevated HAP concentrations easily occur; working males having greater inhalation rates than females; and males working a longer time in their life time than females. Fig.\u00a07 presents the contributions of 7 major parameters to the total variance of risk estimates for working females and males. Results of sensitivity analyses show that variations in the inhalation rates, cancer potency factors of formaldehyde, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene and 1,3-butadiene, and the indoor home concentrations of formaldehyde and benzene are the major contributors to total variance. The 7 major contributors account for over 90% of the total variance; inhalation rate contributes the most. These estimates of which parameters are influencing the risk estimates the most suggest the best way to refine estimates. However, it should be noted that due to lack of sufficient data, the variations in the other parameters such as body weight and time-use distribution were not considered, which may have led to underestimation of the variability in cancer risk estimates, and which could alter the rankings of the parameters.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and butadiene are both mentioned as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that contribute to cancer risk estimates. The analysis highlights their cancer potency factors as significant contributors to the total variance in risk estimates for males and females. However, the relationship between these two compounds is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the same risk assessment framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 1,4-dichlorobenzene and butadiene are identified as contributors to cancer risk estimates, but there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between them in the context.",
