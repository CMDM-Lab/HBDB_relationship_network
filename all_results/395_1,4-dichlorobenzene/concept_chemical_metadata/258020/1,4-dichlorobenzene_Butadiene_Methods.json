    "context": "The miscellaneous \u201cother\u201d microenvironments were assigned the same concentration distributions as the outdoors. Table\u00a01 shows the selected references with information on study location, sampling method, sampling duration, sample size, microenvironment and the types of pollutants. Sixteen HAPs with high abundance in different microenvironments were considered, covering the most high-risk pollutants as listed by Payne-Sturges et al. (2004) and Sax et al. (2006). These were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylbenzene, styrene, tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, toluene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. As raw data, namely the concentrations of individual compounds in individual samples collected during each study were not available for most studies; the reported statistics were used for analyses. To properly weight statistics from individual studies of a given city, we first compared each study's parameters, including percentiles, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max. We weighted equally the studies for each city/geographic region as per Loh et al. (2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and butadiene are both listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) among a group of volatile organic compounds. They are mentioned together in the context of their prevalence in various microenvironments, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions, effects, or any direct relationship beyond their classification as pollutants. Thus, their connection is limited to being part of a broader list of harmful substances without further elaboration on their individual or comparative significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,4-dichlorobenzene and butadiene are mentioned together as part of a list of hazardous air pollutants, indicating a general category but lacking any detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
