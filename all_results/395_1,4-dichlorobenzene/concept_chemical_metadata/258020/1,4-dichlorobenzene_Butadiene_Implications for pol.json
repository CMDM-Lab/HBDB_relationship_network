    "context": "First, about 70% of the risks come from exposures occurring indoor homes while nearly 60% of the risks comes from indoor sources. This is mainly because of the larger fraction of time spent indoors (Table\u00a04) and the higher indoor concentrations (Table\u00a02). Thus, environmental policy should focus on approaches which improve indoor air quality. Second, formaldehyde, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene and 1,3-butadiene are the major risk contributors. Therefore the greatest health gains can be realized by reducing indoor and outdoor emissions of these HAPs. Third, modeled HAP concentrations are appropriately used as surrogates of monitored personal exposures for risk assessment. However, more measured indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations are needed to minimize the gaps between modeled and measured data. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and butadiene are both identified as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that contribute significantly to health risks associated with indoor air quality. The text emphasizes the importance of reducing emissions of these compounds to improve overall health outcomes, indicating a shared relevance in environmental health and risk assessment. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are mentioned as major contributors to health risks from indoor air pollution, indicating a connection in the context of environmental health. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
        "score": 3
