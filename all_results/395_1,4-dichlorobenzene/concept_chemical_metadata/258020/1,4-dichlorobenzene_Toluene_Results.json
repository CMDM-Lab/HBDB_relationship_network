    "context": "It indicates that homes have the largest total HAP concentrations and that HAP concentrations in indoor environments (typically >100\u03bcg/m3) are significantly higher than in outdoor environments. Overall population inhalation exposure to carbonyls and 1,3-butadiene mainly occurs in homes while commuters are exposed to higher concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons as these are associated with vehicle emission.Modeled personal exposures Table\u00a05 shows summary statistics for the modeled personal exposures to each HAP. Mean personal exposure to individual compounds for urban working adults in China ranges from <0.5\u03bcg/m3 for 1,3-butadiene and carbon tetrachloride, to >40\u03bcg/m3 for formaldehyde. On average, formaldehyde, toluene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and acetaldehyde contribute most to the total personal HAP exposures (32.5\u201334.0%, 15.6\u201316.6%, 12.7\u201313.1% and 10.4\u201310.5% respectively). Mean personal HAPs concentrations are larger than the median personal HAPs concentrations, because the former include the full distribution of values including extremes, whereas the median lack physical meaning and would underestimate the exposure (Ott, 1994).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both identified as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) contributing to personal exposure levels in urban environments. They are mentioned alongside other compounds, indicating their significance in indoor air quality and exposure assessments. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative effects between the two compounds, focusing instead on their individual contributions to overall HAP exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are categorized as HAPs contributing to personal exposure, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions within the context.",
