    "context": "The miscellaneous \u201cother\u201d microenvironments were assigned the same concentration distributions as the outdoors. Table\u00a01 shows the selected references with information on study location, sampling method, sampling duration, sample size, microenvironment and the types of pollutants. Sixteen HAPs with high abundance in different microenvironments were considered, covering the most high-risk pollutants as listed by Payne-Sturges et al. (2004) and Sax et al. (2006). These were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylbenzene, styrene, tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, toluene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. As raw data, namely the concentrations of individual compounds in individual samples collected during each study were not available for most studies; the reported statistics were used for analyses. To properly weight statistics from individual studies of a given city, we first compared each study's parameters, including percentiles, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max. We weighted equally the studies for each city/geographic region as per Loh et al. (2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) considered in a study of various microenvironments. They are mentioned alongside other pollutants, indicating their presence in environmental assessments. However, there is no direct discussion of their interactions, effects, or specific relevance to each other within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are categorized as HAPs and are included in the same study. However, their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating only a general connection without specific interactions or implications.",
        "score": 2
