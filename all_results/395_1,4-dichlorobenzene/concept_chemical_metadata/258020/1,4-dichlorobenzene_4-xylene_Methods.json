    "context": "The miscellaneous \u201cother\u201d microenvironments were assigned the same concentration distributions as the outdoors. Table\u00a01 shows the selected references with information on study location, sampling method, sampling duration, sample size, microenvironment and the types of pollutants. Sixteen HAPs with high abundance in different microenvironments were considered, covering the most high-risk pollutants as listed by Payne-Sturges et al. (2004) and Sax et al. (2006). These were formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylbenzene, styrene, tetrachloroethene, trichloroethene, toluene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. As raw data, namely the concentrations of individual compounds in individual samples collected during each study were not available for most studies; the reported statistics were used for analyses. To properly weight statistics from individual studies of a given city, we first compared each study's parameters, including percentiles, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, min, and max. We weighted equally the studies for each city/geographic region as per Loh et al. (2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 4-xylene are both listed among a group of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) that were considered for analysis in various microenvironments. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or specific relevance to each other beyond their classification as pollutants. They are mentioned in the same context but without any detailed connection or comparative analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 4-xylene are merely listed together among other pollutants without any indication of interaction, functional relationship, or shared significance in the context provided.",
