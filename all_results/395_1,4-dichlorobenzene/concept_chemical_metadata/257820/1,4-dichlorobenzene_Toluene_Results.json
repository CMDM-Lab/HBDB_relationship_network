    "context": "Three VOCs were only detected in post-RO water (i.e. 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene and tert butylbenzene), although all with a percentage of detection below 11%. The percentage detection for all VOCs detected in post-RO water but not in STE was below 10% except for p-xylene (15.4%) (Table 2).Groundwater Three (3) VOCs (i.e. 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene and toluene) were detected in groundwater. 1,4-dichlorobenzene (0.005\u00a0\u03bcg/L) was detected once in a sample taken from bore line A during sampling event 4 (January 2008). A replicate sample from bore line A and a sample from bore line B taken the same day were below the LOD (0.003\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Benzene was also detected above LOD (0.04\u00a0\u03bcg/L) in all groundwater samples taken during sampling event 4. Two replicate samples from bore line A were 0.08\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 0.13\u00a0\u03bcg/L, while the concentration in the single bore line B sample was 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/L. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in groundwater samples. However, their relationship is limited to their co-occurrence in the same environmental study, with no further discussion on their interactions, effects, or significance in relation to each other. The detection percentages for both compounds are low, indicating minimal relevance in terms of their environmental impact or chemical interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are identified as VOCs in the same groundwater study, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
