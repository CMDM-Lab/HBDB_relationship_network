    "context": "However, it is neither practical nor feasible to assess for all potential VOCs present in recycled water during routing monitoring. In our study, 1,4-dichlorobenzene was identified as a potential treatment performance indicator for assessment of VOCs in IPR using RO treatment (Blair et\u00a0al., 2010). 1,4-dichlorobenzene was detected in almost 94% of the STE samples and with a median concentration that was over 30 times the average method LOD, therefore fulfilling the criteria for selection of a Treatment Performance Indicator. While the median treatment efficiency by MF/RO treatment was relatively high (87%), the low method LOD meant that 1,4-dichlorobenzene was still detected in almost 89% of the post-RO water samples, ensuring accurate estimates of treatment performance could be calculated. The high frequency of detection of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in STE is attributed to its long history of domestic use in toilet products, moth repellents, and mildew control agents (Aronson et\u00a0al., 2007; NICNAS, 2000). Dichlorobenzene has also been reported as one of the less biodegradable VOCs in wastewater treatment (Koe and Shen, 1997). As a small (molecular weight\u00a0=\u00a0147\u00a0g/mol) and uncharged molecule, the RO rejection of 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mostly attributed to its relatively high logKow (3.4) compared to other VOCs.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is identified as a significant treatment performance indicator for assessing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in recycled water, specifically in the context of reverse osmosis (RO) treatment. It was detected in a high percentage of samples, indicating its prevalence in recycled water and its relevance in evaluating treatment efficiency. The study highlights the challenges of detecting all VOCs in recycled water, with 1,4-dichlorobenzene serving as a key marker for treatment performance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 1,4-dichlorobenzene and water specimens, as the compound is used as an indicator for assessing treatment performance in recycled water. The context provides quantitative data on detection rates and treatment efficiency, underscoring its significance.",
