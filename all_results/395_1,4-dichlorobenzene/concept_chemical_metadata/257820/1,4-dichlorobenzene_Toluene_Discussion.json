    "context": "The KWRP MF/RO plant is located on the site of an oil refinery that produces petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, aviation gasoline, jet fuel and bitumen and it is likely that trace concentrations of associated compounds would be found in water samples from KWRP. The low concentrations measured in post-RO water and field blanks compared to post-MF water suggests that this contamination did not occur during sampling, but most likely occurred during the MF treatment where the water is exposed to the atmosphere for about 25\u00a0min. A number of the tanks also have air vents that may enable some exposure to the atmosphere both before MF and after RO of up to an hour, although the vents are less likely to be a significant source of exposure compared with the open tanks. At BPP, there were only 4 VOCs for which the highest median concentration was measured in a post-MF sample: i.e. carbon disulphide (66%), toluene (100%), 1,3-dichloropropene (33%), and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (66%). While they are not typically measured as disinfection by-products, dichlorobenzenes are produced from the chlorination of benzene (IARC, 1999) and therefore it is possible that they may form, petroleum-based contamination. However the source of these VOCs is not obvious at this time.Treatment performance Overall treatment efficiency was calculated as a proportion of removal, comparing STE and post-RO samples that were matched for plant and date. For those parameters reported below LOD after RO, the efficiency was calculated assuming a concentration equal to half the LOD. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in water samples from a treatment plant associated with an oil refinery. While both compounds are noted in the context of contamination and treatment performance, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their presence as contaminants in the same environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are identified as VOCs in the same study, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating they share a general category without detailed interaction.",
        "score": 2
