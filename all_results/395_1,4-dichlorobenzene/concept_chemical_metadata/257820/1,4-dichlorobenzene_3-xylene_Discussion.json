    "context": "However, in Western Australia, all public drinking water bores are protected by catchment protection reserves.The effect of MF/RO treatment on VOC concentration In both the BPP and KWRP, wastewater undergoes chloramination before MF to prevent RO membrane fouling. Samples of post-MF water were therefore analysed to determine the effect of chloramination during the MF/RO process. Paired wastewater, post-MF and post-RO samples were taken on 6 occasions at KWRP (1 in sampling event 1, 3 in sampling event 2, 1 in sampling event 3 and 1 in sampling event 6) and on 3 occasions at BPP (sampling events 3, 4 and 6). At KWRP, there were 21 analytes for which the highest median concentration was measured in a post-MF sample: chloromethane, trichlorofluoromethane (freon 11), carbon disulphide, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, trichloroethene, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, styrene,\u00a01,3,5-trimethylbenzene, tert butylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 2-propyltoluene, p-isopropyl toluene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, n-butyl benzene, and naphthalene. Although the percentage detections for some of these analytes were low, 11 were present in more than 50% of\u00a0post-MF samples: chloromethane (100%), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (83%), toluene (83%), ethyl benzene (100%), o-xylene (100%), m-xylene (100%), p-xylene (100%), styrene (67%), 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (83%), 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (100%), and naphthalene (83%). During this research project, chloramination was found to increase the concentration of some disinfection by-products (DBPs) during MF/RO treatment, particularly the halomethanes (DOHWA, 2009, Linge et\u00a0al. in prep). Chloromethane is considered a disinfection by-product (Krasner et\u00a0al., 2006) and may have also been formed by chloramination. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in post-membrane filtration (MF) water samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations in treated wastewater, indicating their presence but lacking specific relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 3-xylene are simply listed among various VOCs without any detailed interaction or functional relationship discussed in the context.",
