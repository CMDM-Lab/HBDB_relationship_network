    "context": "That is, personal exposure to the aromatic hydrocarbons and MTBE as a group might affect the serum levels of albumin, ALP, and GGT, while personal exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene might affect serum concentrations of LDH and total bilirubin.Relationship between individual VOCs and biochemical liver tests The results of individual relationships from the linear regressions for the important exposure and outcome variables selected from the above canonical analysis are shown in Tables 5 and 6 . After adjustment for several covariates, personal exposure to benzene, toluene, and MTBE were significantly associated with serum albumin under the significance level of 0.10, while tetrachloroethene was significantly associated with LDH and total bilirubin. In this study, we found that there was a significant correlation between the set of VOCs and the set of biochemical liver tests. That is, individual exposure to the five aromatic hydrocarbons and MTBE tended to be associated with serum levels of albumin, ALP, and GGT, while individual exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene tended to be associated with serum concentrations of LDH and total bilirubin. The ability of CCA to analyze the relationship between the two sets of variables has several advantages. First, as it used the information from all the variables in both the exposure and outcome variable sets and maximized the estimation of the relationship between the two sets, CCA could be more efficient in assessing the effect of the VOCs on biochemical liver tests than the methods used previously such as multiple linear regressions. As a result, CCA could be more suitable for detecting a subtle effect of VOCs at relatively low exposure levels. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is identified as a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons. The study discusses the relationship between personal exposure to various aromatic hydrocarbons, including 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and their effects on biochemical liver tests. While 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mentioned alongside other aromatic hydrocarbons, the focus is on its association with serum concentrations of LDH and total bilirubin, indicating a potential health impact related to its exposure as part of the aromatic hydrocarbon group.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,4-dichlorobenzene and aromatic hydrocarbons, supported by evidence of their collective impact on liver biochemical tests. The context highlights specific associations, indicating a clear relationship within the study's framework.",
        "score": 4
