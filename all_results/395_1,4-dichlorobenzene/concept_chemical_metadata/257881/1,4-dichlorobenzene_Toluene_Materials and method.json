    "context": "Serum markers of liver function assessed in NHANES 1999\u2013000 include: albumin, total bilirubin (TB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Laboratory procedures and quality control of the measurements are detailed by the NHANES Laboratory Procedure Manual (CDCd). In this study, the biochemical liver tests served as continuous outcome variables in the analyses. 2.2.3 Personal exposure to VOCs Personal exposure to 10 VOCs including benzene, chloroform, ethylbenzene, tetrachloroethene, toluene, trichloroethene, o-xylene, m-,p-xylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) were assessed through the use of passive exposure monitors (or badges) worn by participants for a period of 48\u201372h. The actual duration of exposure ranged from 43.3 to 76.0h with a mean of 56.4h. The number of cubic meters for each subject was derived from the duration the exposure monitor was used. The value for each analyte was expressed as the weight of the analyte per cubic meter. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) assessed for personal exposure in a study involving NHANES participants. They are part of a broader analysis of various VOCs and their potential impact on liver function markers. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance within the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are included in the same study on VOC exposure but lack a detailed relationship or interaction discussed in the context.",
