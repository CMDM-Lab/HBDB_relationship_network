    "context": "While there were occurrences of I/O<1 for only benzene for kindergartens, only naphthalene had no occurrence of I/O<1 in the 10th to 90th percentile range for classrooms. The mean I/O values of TVOC51 were 2.1 for the classrooms and 3.5 for the kindergartens, which show that there were strong indoor sources for the both microenvironments. The mean I/O values for all the compounds presented in Fig. 4 were >1 (six VOCs with 1.3\u20131.8, and three VOCs with >2: toluene 2.1, naphthalene 4.9, and 1,3-dichlorobenzene 5.1) for the classrooms, whereas all the mean I/O values were >2 for kindergartens (from 2.2 for benzene to 5.5 for 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) except for styrene (1.9). The difference in the median I/O values for the classrooms and the kindergartens were significant for only toluene (p =0.005) and TVOC51 (p =0.05). The difference in the median I/O values between the classrooms and the kindergartens was also significant for formaldehyde (p =0.005). The mean I/O values were >10 for both of the microenvironments, therefore, formaldehyde had the strongest indoor sources compared to the VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios in classrooms and kindergartens. However, the text primarily focuses on the I/O values of various VOCs without detailing any specific interactions or comparative significance between 1,4-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene. Their mention is more about their presence in the same study rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are part of a broader analysis of VOCs in indoor environments, but there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "score": 2
