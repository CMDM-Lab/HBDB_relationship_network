    "context": "According to a review (Daisey et al., 2003), the average TVOC concentrations ranged from 100 to 1600\u03bcg/m3 in different European and US schools while the mean formaldehyde concentrations in the schools ranged from 10 to 430\u03bcg/m3. The highest median VOC concentrations measured in Minnesota, USA, schools were reported as 4.6, 2.9, and 2.3\u03bcg/m3 for d-limonene, toluene, and m,p-xylene, respectively (Adgate et al., 2004), where winter term concentrations were higher than those measured in spring term. A year long sampling was performed in three primary schools in Western Australia (Zhang et al., 2006). Ten compounds were identified (benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene) at low concentrations (TVOC<100\u03bcg/m3) of which the highest was measured in a visual art classroom. Godwin and Batterman (2007) conducted a study in 64 classrooms in a suburban school district not under the effect of ambient pollution sources in Michigan, USA. The most prevalent VOCs were benzene, ethylbenezene, toluene, xylene, and limonene but the concentrations were low with the mean TVOC level of 58\u03bcg/m3. In general, the literature reported higher indoor, winter, and kindergarten VOC concentrations compared to outdoor, summer, and classrooms, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in various school environments. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed beyond their classification as VOCs present in indoor air quality studies. The context primarily focuses on the concentrations of these compounds without detailing any interactions or comparative significance between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both identified as VOCs in the same studies, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them.",
        "score": 2
