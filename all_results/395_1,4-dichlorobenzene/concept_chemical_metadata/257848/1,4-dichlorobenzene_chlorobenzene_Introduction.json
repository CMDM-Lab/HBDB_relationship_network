    "context": "According to a review (Daisey et al., 2003), the average TVOC concentrations ranged from 100 to 1600\u03bcg/m3 in different European and US schools while the mean formaldehyde concentrations in the schools ranged from 10 to 430\u03bcg/m3. The highest median VOC concentrations measured in Minnesota, USA, schools were reported as 4.6, 2.9, and 2.3\u03bcg/m3 for d-limonene, toluene, and m,p-xylene, respectively (Adgate et al., 2004), where winter term concentrations were higher than those measured in spring term. A year long sampling was performed in three primary schools in Western Australia (Zhang et al., 2006). Ten compounds were identified (benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene) at low concentrations (TVOC<100\u03bcg/m3) of which the highest was measured in a visual art classroom. Godwin and Batterman (2007) conducted a study in 64 classrooms in a suburban school district not under the effect of ambient pollution sources in Michigan, USA. The most prevalent VOCs were benzene, ethylbenezene, toluene, xylene, and limonene but the concentrations were low with the mean TVOC level of 58\u03bcg/m3. In general, the literature reported higher indoor, winter, and kindergarten VOC concentrations compared to outdoor, summer, and classrooms, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in various school environments. They are mentioned alongside other VOCs in studies assessing indoor air quality, but there is no specific discussion of their chemical interactions or comparative significance. Their relationship is limited to their classification as VOCs found in similar settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs present in the same studies regarding indoor air quality. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other.",
        "score": 2
