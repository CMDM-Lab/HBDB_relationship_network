    "context": "While there were occurrences of I/O<1 for only benzene for kindergartens, only naphthalene had no occurrence of I/O<1 in the 10th to 90th percentile range for classrooms. The mean I/O values of TVOC51 were 2.1 for the classrooms and 3.5 for the kindergartens, which show that there were strong indoor sources for the both microenvironments. The mean I/O values for all the compounds presented in Fig. 4 were >1 (six VOCs with 1.3\u20131.8, and three VOCs with >2: toluene 2.1, naphthalene 4.9, and 1,3-dichlorobenzene 5.1) for the classrooms, whereas all the mean I/O values were >2 for kindergartens (from 2.2 for benzene to 5.5 for 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) except for styrene (1.9). The difference in the median I/O values for the classrooms and the kindergartens were significant for only toluene (p =0.005) and TVOC51 (p =0.05). The difference in the median I/O values between the classrooms and the kindergartens was also significant for formaldehyde (p =0.005). The mean I/O values were >10 for both of the microenvironments, therefore, formaldehyde had the strongest indoor sources compared to the VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with reported indoor air quality measurements. However, their specific relationship is not discussed in detail. The focus is on the indoor sources and mean indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of various VOCs, including toluene, which has a significant I/O value, while 1,4-dichlorobenzene is not highlighted in the same manner. Thus, they are related as components of indoor air quality assessments but lack a direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the same study on indoor air quality, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other.",
