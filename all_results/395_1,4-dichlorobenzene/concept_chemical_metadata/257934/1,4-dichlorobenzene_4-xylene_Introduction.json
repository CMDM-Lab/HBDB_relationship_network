    "context": "Both models define the chromatographic retention factor (k) as the key parameter determining the breakthrough volume since, for a limited range of flow-rates and a specified sampling system, changes in hold-up volume and plate number provide only a marginal change in breakthrough volume, provided that N and V M are not very small. Then, the distribution coefficient K can be seen as an indirect measure of the retention factor. In this work, both parameters (breakthrough volume and distribution coefficient), as well as others relevant in chromatographic theory such as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (H) and the asymmetry factor (F a) are monitored to check the feasibility of two relatively new SPE polymeric resins, Bond Elut ENV (styrene-divinylbenzene) and LiChrolut EN (ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene) in gas sampling followed by thermal desorption. The behavior of these new generation resins is compared to the most widespread sorbent, Tenax TA, in trapping-desorbing some volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as 1-octene, ethylbenzene, (o-, m-, p-)xylenes, styrene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Materials The chemical standards used and their corresponding CAS numbers were the following: 1-octene (98%, 111-66-0); and ethylbenzene (99.5%, 100-42-5) were purchased from Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). Styrene (99%, 100-42-5), o-xylene (99%, 95-47-6), m-xylene (99%, 108-38-3, 1.2mgkg\u22121), p-xylene (99%, 106-42-3) and dichlorobenzene (99%, 106-46-7) were supplied by Fluka-Riedel de H\u00e4en (Madrid, Spain). Each chemical was diluted up to 1% using ethyl ether (GC quality) as solvent. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being analyzed in relation to their retention behavior in chromatographic processes. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their inclusion in a list of chemicals used for comparison in gas sampling and thermal desorption studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs and are part of the same study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific functional relationships.",
