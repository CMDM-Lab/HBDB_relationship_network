    "context": "In this work, both parameters (breakthrough volume and distribution coefficient), as well as others relevant in chromatographic theory such as the height equivalent to a theoretical plate (H) and the asymmetry factor (F a) are monitored to check the feasibility of two relatively new SPE polymeric resins, Bond Elut ENV (styrene-divinylbenzene) and LiChrolut EN (ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene) in gas sampling followed by thermal desorption. The behavior of these new generation resins is compared to the most widespread sorbent, Tenax TA, in trapping-desorbing some volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as 1-octene, ethylbenzene, (o-, m-, p-)xylenes, styrene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Materials The chemical standards used and their corresponding CAS numbers were the following: 1-octene (98%, 111-66-0); and ethylbenzene (99.5%, 100-42-5) were purchased from Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). Styrene (99%, 100-42-5), o-xylene (99%, 95-47-6), m-xylene (99%, 108-38-3, 1.2mgkg\u22121), p-xylene (99%, 106-42-3) and dichlorobenzene (99%, 106-46-7) were supplied by Fluka-Riedel de H\u00e4en (Madrid, Spain). Each chemical was diluted up to 1% using ethyl ether (GC quality) as solvent. The solid sorbents used were Tenax TA 60\u201380 mesh purchased from Supelco (Madrid, Spain), Bond Elut ENV from Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and LiChrolut EN from Merck.Preparation of the packed sorbent columns Solid sorbents were previously conditioned by washing with methanol and dried under vacuum.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being evaluated for their trapping and desorption behavior using new polymeric resins in gas sampling. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their inclusion in the same study of VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are part of a broader study on VOCs and their behavior with sorbents, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific significance in relation to each other.",
        "score": 2
