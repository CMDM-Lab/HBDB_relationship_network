    "context": "Chlorinated hydrocarbons are another group of organics frequently detected in each microenvironment with widely scattered point sources. Chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene are representative organics and long-term exposure to them is a concern in terms of cancer risks. Concentrations of these compounds typically vary from less than 1 to 10\u03bcg/m3 in different microenvironments. In indoors, use of moth repellants and/or deodorizers is associated with higher levels of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (Lee et al., 2002b; Tang et al., 2005). Weschler (2009) has reported increased concentrations of terpenoids (limonene and \u03b1-pinene) in indoor environments due to increased use of terpenoid solvents and scents. This deserves attention because long-term exposure to terpenoids could provoke irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and skin. Also, due to their reactive isoprenic structure, they might be oxidized by ozone or other oxidants to more harmful secondary products (Nazaroff and Weschler, 2004). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mentioned as a chlorinated hydrocarbon with potential cancer risks due to long-term exposure, particularly in indoor environments. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of Tangier Disease, which is a genetic disorder affecting lipid metabolism. The two terms appear in the same context but lack a clear relationship or interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,4-dichlorobenzene and Tangier Disease are mentioned in the same context without any direct connection or relevance to each other.",
