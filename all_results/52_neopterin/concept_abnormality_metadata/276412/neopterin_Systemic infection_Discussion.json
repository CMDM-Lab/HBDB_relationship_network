    "context": "The question of whether SDB is associated with, and possibly contributes to, low-grade systemic inflammation has been the topic of numerous studies in recent years. 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Motivating this area of research is the mounting evidence linking elevated markers of systemic inflammation to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Neopterin, which was first isolated from humans in 1967, has been used as indicator of cell-mediated immunity in pathologic states that are characterized by activation of T-helper type 1 lymphocytes. 42 Elevated neopterin levels have been noted in clinical conditions such as systemic infections, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, renal failure, and cardiovascular disease. 17 Although numerous studies indicate that biochemical markers such as CRP are useful in predicting coronary events, there are some data suggesting that measurements of neopterin alone or in combination with CRP may have better clinical utility. 25 29 Longitudinal follow-up of patients with chronic stable angina has shown that higher levels of neopterin but not CRP were associated with a greater incidence of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring hospitalization or urgent revascularization, and cardiac death. 29 High neopterin levels have also been correlated with morphologically complex coronary lesions 43 even after adjusting for CRP levels, 27 and thus have been used as a marker for risk stratifying patients with acute coronary syndromes.

        "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a biomarker indicative of cell-mediated immunity, particularly in conditions characterized by T-helper type 1 lymphocyte activation. Elevated levels of neopterin are associated with systemic infections, among other pathologies. This suggests that neopterin can serve as a useful indicator for the presence and severity of systemic infections, linking it to broader systemic inflammation and related health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between neopterin and systemic infection, as elevated neopterin levels are specifically noted in the context of systemic infections. The evidence presented supports its role as a biomarker for immune activation in such conditions.",
        "score": 4
