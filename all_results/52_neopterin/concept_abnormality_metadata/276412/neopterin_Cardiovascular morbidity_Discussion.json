    "context": "Finally, the modest sample size and the lack of female subjects limit the generalizability of our findings. Nonetheless, the current study has numerous strengths that include the strict exclusion of known prevalent medical conditions that could influence neopterin levels, use of full-montage polysomnography to characterize SDB, consideration of age and obesity measures as possible confounders, and the ability to link neopterin to the degree of nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep stage distribution. The data provided herein extend prior observations that SDB is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and more specifically provide first evidence for macrophage activation, which can be pathogenic for conditions such coronary artery disease. Although the clinical significance of elevated neopterin in SDB will require further investigation, it may hold clinical utility in identifying vulnerable SDB patients at risk for future cardiovascular morbidity. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that SDB is associated with levels of circulating neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation. Introduction Historically, the concept of purinergic signalling was proposed by Burnstock in 1972 after a purine nucleotide was shown to act as a neurotransmitter in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves supplying the gut and urinary bladder. In fact, most of the early studies of purinergic signalling were focused on the autonomic nervous system and were largely concerned with rapid signalling in neurotransmission (for review, see Ref.).

        "summary": "In this context, neopterin is linked to cardiovascular morbidity through its association with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and systemic inflammation. Elevated levels of neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation, may indicate increased risk for cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease. The study suggests that monitoring neopterin could help identify SDB patients at higher risk for future cardiovascular issues, highlighting its potential clinical significance in this area.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between neopterin and cardiovascular morbidity, supported by evidence of neopterin's role as a marker for macrophage activation and its association with systemic inflammation linked to cardiovascular diseases.",
