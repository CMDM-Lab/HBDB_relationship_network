    "context": "56 However, despite statistical adjustments for BMI, waist circumference, and percentage of body fat, the associations between SDB severity and serum neopterin levels persisted. Second, it is also possible that, regardless of the careful selection of the patient sample and exclusion of various comorbidities, subclinical vascular disease may underlie the observed association. Finally, the modest sample size and the lack of female subjects limit the generalizability of our findings. Nonetheless, the current study has numerous strengths that include the strict exclusion of known prevalent medical conditions that could influence neopterin levels, use of full-montage polysomnography to characterize SDB, consideration of age and obesity measures as possible confounders, and the ability to link neopterin to the degree of nocturnal hypoxemia and sleep stage distribution. The data provided herein extend prior observations that SDB is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and more specifically provide first evidence for macrophage activation, which can be pathogenic for conditions such coronary artery disease. Although the clinical significance of elevated neopterin in SDB will require further investigation, it may hold clinical utility in identifying vulnerable SDB patients at risk for future cardiovascular morbidity. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that SDB is associated with levels of circulating neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, neopterin is associated with systemic inflammation linked to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which is influenced by obesity. The study indicates that serum neopterin levels remain elevated despite adjustments for obesity measures, suggesting a potential role of neopterin as a marker for inflammation in obese patients with SDB. This relationship highlights the importance of neopterin in understanding the inflammatory processes that may be exacerbated by obesity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between neopterin and obesity, as the study discusses how neopterin levels are influenced by obesity-related factors and their implications for systemic inflammation. The evidence suggests a clear relationship, although further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved.",
