    "context": "Also striking was the difference in relative abundance of ethanethioic acid S methyl ester released from the cultured feces of the CKD rats (267ppbv) and control (12ppbv) rats (Table\u00a03).Exhaled breath data More than 50 volatile organic compounds were detected in the animals' exhaled breath. Table\u00a04 summarizes the levels of the detected compounds in the exhaled breath of the control and CKD animals. Among the compounds detected in exhaled breath, the relative abundance of four gases including isoprene and three aldehydes i.e. pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal were significantly different (P<0.05) between the CKD and the control groups. The exhaled breath isoprene level was about 2.5 times higher in the CKD animals compared to that found in the control group averaging 380pptv in the CKD rats vs. 150pptv in the control group. In contrast exhaled breath pentanal, hexanal and heptanal levels were significantly lower in the CKD than in the control rats. Specifically, the exhaled breath in CKD animals contained nearly half the amount of these aldehydes than those found in the control group. The average mixing ratios for pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal at week six were 190, 830, and 1300pptv respectively in the CKD rats and 340, 1380, and 2130, respectively in the control rats. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not explicitly mentioned, but the study focuses on the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of control and chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats. The relationship between exhalation and the presence of various VOCs, including isoprene and aldehydes, is highlighted, indicating that exhalation is a key method for detecting these compounds. However, without specific mention of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, its direct relevance to exhalation remains unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as exhalation is discussed in the context of VOC analysis, but 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not directly addressed, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
