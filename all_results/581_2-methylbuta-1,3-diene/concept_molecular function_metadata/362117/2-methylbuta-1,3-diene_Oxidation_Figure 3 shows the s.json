    "context": "[2] The March peak is observed by HCHO columns during 1998, 1999 and 2001; this peak is muted in 1997 (an El Nino year), occurring earlier in the year, and does not appear in 2000. [3] The September peak is a feature observed in all years shown, but with some year-to-year variability in magnitude and timing. [4] Formaldehyde columns during May\u00e2\u20ac\u201cJune are close to background values from CH4 oxidation. [5] Formaldehyde production from isoprene oxidation is still significant even with low NOx concentrations typically found over remote tropical ecosystems away from active fires (e.g. ). [6] Any smearing effect due to time-delayed HCHO production owing to peroxide formation (via HO2\u00e2\u20ac\u201cRO2 reactions) will effectively be included as the background HCHO over the defined geographical region. [1] In situ isoprene data are sparse, but there is almost a complete annual record of isoprene concentration 67\u00e2\u20ac\u0160km south of Santhar\u00c3\u00a9m (2\u00c2\u00b051.42\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 [2] S, 54\u00c2\u00b057.42\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes, particularly in the formation of formaldehyde (HCHO) during atmospheric reactions. The oxidation of isoprene is significant even under low NOx conditions, indicating its role in atmospheric chemistry and the production of secondary pollutants. This highlights the importance of isoprene oxidation in understanding air quality and chemical processes in remote ecosystems.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and oxidation, as the context discusses the oxidation of isoprene and its implications for formaldehyde production, supported by evidence of its atmospheric behavior. This relationship is crucial for understanding environmental chemistry.",
