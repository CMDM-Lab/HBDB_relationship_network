An additional LI-6400 was occasionally used in which a portion of gas exiting the cuvette was diverted to a 2-mL sample loop of a portable, isothermal gas chromatograph, and isoprene was separated on a stainless steel column (1.3\u00a0m long x 2\u00a0mm i.d.) packed with Unibeads 3S, 60\u201380 mesh (Alltech Assoc., Deerfield, IL, USA). Isoprene eluting from the column was measured with a reduction gas detector (Model RGD2, Trace Analytical, Menlo Park, CA, USA), and peak integration was accomplished using PeakSimple Chromatography Software (SRI Instruments, Las Vegas, NV, USA). Because the sensitivity of the analytical system varied with ambient temperature, the isoprene detection system was calibrated after approximately every fifth measurement using a standard cylinder containing 45\u00a0ppbv isoprene, referenced to an NIST Butene/Benzene standard using gas chromatography (Model 7890a, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with both a flame ionization detector and an electron ionization mass-selective detector. In August, an additional photosynthesis system (MPH-1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) was deployed. Leaves were enclosed in a custom-built temperature-controlled, fan-stirred glass cuvette (Allen Scientific Glass, Boulder, CO, USA) 12.5\u00a0cm in diameter (volume of 425\u00a0cm3) and concentrations of CO2 and H2O measured using an Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA, Model LI-6262, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA, see Harley et\u00a0al., 2014 for complete description). Exhaust gas leaving the cuvette was ported to an Ionicon proton transfer time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS 8000, Ionicon Analytik, Austria) and isoprene concentrations were monitored at protonated m/z 69.066.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is analyzed using a proton transfer time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) to monitor its concentrations. The ionization process is crucial for detecting isoprene, as it involves protonation at a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z 69.066). This indicates a direct relationship where ionization is essential for the measurement and analysis of isoprene concentrations in the exhaust gas from the photosynthesis system.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and ionization, as the detection of isoprene relies on the ionization process in mass spectrometry. The context provides clear evidence of this relationship through the use of specific ionization techniques for accurate measurement.",
