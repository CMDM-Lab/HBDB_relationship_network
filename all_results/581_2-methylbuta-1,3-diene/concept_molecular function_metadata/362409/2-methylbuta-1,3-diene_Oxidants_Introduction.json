    "context": "Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound (BVOC) emissions from forests are important inputs to atmospheric chemistry and air quality models, since they can control oxidant chemistry and secondary aerosol formation over many regions of the globe (Guenther et\u00a0al., 2006). The Model of Emissions and Gases from Nature, (MEGAN) version 2.1 (Guenther et\u00a0al., 2012), is currently applied to estimate landscape scale emissions of BVOCs. MEGAN results have been compared with measured fluxes of BVOCs at a few global sites, and MEGAN has been found to simulate fluxes and the short-term effects of light and temperature on emissions reasonably well (M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2008). We also compared MEGAN2.1 with above canopy BVOC fluxes during the experiment PINOT NOIR (Particle Investigations at a Northern Ozarks Tower \u2013 NOx, Oxidants, Isoprene Research) during the summers of 2011 and 2012. MEGAN2.1 BVOC emission estimates agreed well with observed isoprene (2011) and isoprene and monoterpene (2012) emissions during early summer, but over-estimated emissions during mid to late summer droughts in both years (Potosnak et\u00a0al., 2014; Seco et\u00a0al., 2015). Here we report leaf level BVOC emission measurements on some important Ozark oak species during pre-drought (June 2012), drought (August 2012), and post-drought senescent (October 2012) conditions to gain insight into the effects of drought on BVOC emissions from individual oak species. We discuss the relationship between leaf\u2013level BVOC emissions and above canopy fluxes and their comparisons with MEGAN2.1.Site description PINOT NOIR was conducted at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, which has been operating since Spring of 2004 with a suite of meteorological and ecological instrumentation.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), is indirectly related to oxidants through its role in atmospheric chemistry. BVOCs like 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene can influence oxidant levels and secondary aerosol formation, which are critical for understanding air quality and atmospheric processes. However, the specific interactions between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and oxidants are not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to its impact on oxidant chemistry, indicating a connection, but lacks detailed discussion of their direct interactions.",
