    "context": "Above-canopy monoterpene fluxes observed during PINOT NOIR are among the highest observed anywhere in North America. Peak MNT fluxes exceeded 3.75 mgC\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0h\u22121 in late June (Seco et\u00a0al., 2015). These fluxes exceed extrapolations of the leaf and branch enclosure emission data by at least an order of magnitude, although the canopy MNT fluxes are given only as total monoterpenes (AMU 136) from the PTRMS as determined from the main MNT fragment (m/z\u00a0=\u00a081) and protonated parent mass (m/z\u00a0=\u00a0137). MNT compounds have been observed as light- and temperature-dependent emissions from flowering plants such as deciduous broadleaf trees and are thought to be under synthesis and environmental controls similar to isoprene emission. The above-canopy diurnal MNT flux profile is very similar to the isoprene flux profile at this site, suggesting that MNT emission from the Ozark deciduous canopy is indeed under similar controls. The Inficon emission samples suggest that, compared to Q.\u00a0rubra, MNTs are less abundant relative to isoprene from Q.\u00a0velutina, Q alba and Q.\u00a0stellata, by factors of approximately 7, 35 and 4 in June and 6, 5, and 10 in August, respectively. The branch enclosures yielded MNT compound profiles similar to MNT compound profiles from the leaf enclosure samples analyzed on the Inficon. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a monoterpene, is discussed in relation to its emission from flowering plants, particularly deciduous trees. The synthesis of monoterpenes like 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is influenced by environmental factors such as light and temperature, similar to isoprene emissions. The study highlights the synthesis of these compounds as a response to environmental controls, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its synthesis process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and synthesis, as the context discusses how environmental factors influence the synthesis of monoterpenes, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, with evidence of their emission patterns.",
