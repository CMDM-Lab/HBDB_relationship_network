    "context": "Four times during the day, and at different T L , light was rapidly reduced to zero. Except under cooler T L (20\u00a0\u00b0C), isoprene emissions did not fall to zero after 10\u00a0min or more in the dark (Fig.\u00a06). This level of I L in the dark was particularly high at a leaf temperature of 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Significant dark emissions, when DMAPP production should rapidly drop to zero, further support the idea that under these extreme stress conditions of drought and high temperature, DMAPP for isoprene production may derive from a source other than immediately fixed photosynthetic products. The non-enzymatic reaction of DMAPP to isoprene, known to be acid catalyzed (Silver and Fall, 1991), may partly account for this isoprene, although at physiologically relevant pH levels this source is expected to produce emissions at levels lower than we observed in the dark (Fig.\u00a06). Alternatively, Li and Sharkey (2013) find that large pools of methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcDP) may explain transient and dark emissions of I L from hybrid aspen (Populus tremula\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0alba). During the drought conditions on August 8, I L from the same Q. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions during photosynthesis, particularly under stress conditions like drought and high temperatures. The study suggests that isoprene production may not solely rely on photosynthetic products, indicating a complex relationship where isoprene emissions can occur even when photosynthesis is expected to be low, hinting at alternative metabolic pathways involved in isoprene synthesis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and photosynthesis, as the context discusses isoprene emissions in relation to photosynthetic activity and stress conditions. The evidence suggests that isoprene production may involve mechanisms beyond direct photosynthetic processes.",
