    "context": "Given the large variability in physiological, growth, and survival responses to drought between Quercus species, it seems reasonable to expect that l I L and leaf-level monoterpene (M L ) emission rates may also show varying response to drought stress among the oaks. We attempted to characterize this variability by examining I L and M L from several oak species before, during and after the severe drought experienced in the Ozarks in the summer of 2012. We compare these observations with the above canopy fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes measured during the course of the growing season. Leaf isoprene emission rates (I L , in \u03bcgC (g leaf dry weight)\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 unless otherwise specified) were measured by enclosing portions of leaves in the cuvette of two LI-COR 6400 plant photosynthesis systems (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Exit air was ported to two Photovac (Perkin\u2013Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) photoionization detection (PID) systems as described in Geron et\u00a0al. (2002). Additionally, Tenax TA/Carboxen 563 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) adsorbent cartridges were used to sample from the Li-Cor exit air for analysis with an Inficon (East Syracuse, NY, USA) HAPSITE ER gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system with a thermal desorption unit, which allowed on-site identification and quantitation of isoprene and monoterpenes.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission rates from oak leaves during varying drought conditions. The study examines how these emissions correlate with photosynthesis, as isoprene is a byproduct of photosynthetic processes in plants. The relationship is significant as it highlights the physiological responses of oak species to environmental stressors, linking isoprene emissions to the broader context of photosynthesis and plant health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and photosynthesis, as isoprene is directly produced during photosynthesis in plants. The study provides evidence of how environmental factors like drought influence isoprene emissions, indicating a clear relationship within the physiological context.",
