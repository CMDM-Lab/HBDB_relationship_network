    "context": "[10] This early reaction would fall within the homeostatic mechanisms set up by the fruits during abscission induction, as recently hypothesized . [11] In this specific case, however, ROS levels did not decrease as a consequence of increased isoprene emission, probably because abscission induction was at this point irreversible. [12] Isoprene, in addition to acting directly as an antioxidant, may also be involved in specific signaling pathways leading to a broader cellular response to abiotic stresses. [13] Cooperating with NO, isoprene was shown to reduce oxidative damage in leaves , and this effect is likely to be dependent upon interactions occurring at the signaling level rather than direct scavenging reactions . [14] The involvement of NO in the signal cascade that initiates the hypersensitive response occurring in plant-pathogen interactions  and its cooperation with isoprene may suggest that a number of other processes are also likely to be affected, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the elicitation of jasmonate and salicylate signaling pathways typically involved in the hypersensitive response . [15] Transcriptomic analyses performed by  indicate that the above-cited processes were triggered early (at 17 DAPF) during abscission induction, especially concerning the up-regulation of genes coding for a jasmonate-induced protein, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. [16] For the latter two genes, a role in the cross talk with ethylene signaling, which is activated downstream , may be hypothesized, along with an interaction with NO signaling, as previously pointed out (; ).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is implicated in signal transduction pathways related to plant responses to abiotic stresses. It is suggested that isoprene interacts with nitric oxide (NO) to modulate oxidative damage and activate signaling cascades, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which are crucial for the hypersensitive response in plants. This indicates a significant role for isoprene in cellular signaling mechanisms beyond its antioxidant properties.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and signal transduction, as the context discusses isoprene's involvement in specific signaling pathways and its interaction with NO, indicating a clear relationship supported by evidence of its role in plant stress responses.",
