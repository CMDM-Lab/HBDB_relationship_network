    "context": "[2] The majority of the carbon incorporated in this molecule was proven to come from photosynthesis in several species (; ; ; ; ; ; ), although additional sources either chloroplastic, such as starch degradation , or extrachloroplastic, such as transported carbohydrates (; ), or CO2 coming from mitochondrial respiration , may also contribute. [3] In abscising apple fruitlets, isoprene biosynthesis was shown to be sustained even with photosynthesis inhibition, which is known to occur soon after MET treatments in apple and persist up to 5 d after the chemical application . [4] Moreover, the nutritional stress caused by both BA and MET indirectly reduces the already low assimilate availability to the sinks (i.e. the fruitlets), suggesting that a contribution to isoprene biosynthesis from transported carbohydrates may be ruled out. [5] Taking into account that  observed an increase of Suc and a decrease of starch concentration in the cortex of AFs, it may be hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis in these fruits is supported by both starch degradation and respiration (following Suc breakdown). [6] Specific investigations will be focused on these aspects to shed light on which metabolisms are more active in feeding isoprene biosynthesis in apple fruitlets undergoing a nutritional stress, such as that caused by the thinning treatments. [1] The determination of ABA levels in the cortex allowed the identification of a significant correlation between the hormone content and isoprene emission (Fig. 5). [2] Increased levels of the hormone observed in BA-treated L3 fruitlets (Fig. 4C) concurrently with the up-regulation of the ABA-responsive MdNCED1 gene (MDP0000228070; Fig. 7) suggests an activation of the indirect biosynthetic pathway of the hormone.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is linked to respiration as a potential contributor to its biosynthesis in apple fruitlets. The text suggests that isoprene production may be supported by starch degradation and respiration processes, particularly following sucrose breakdown. This indicates a metabolic relationship where respiration plays a role in providing substrates for isoprene biosynthesis, especially under nutritional stress conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and respiration is discussed in terms of metabolic contributions to isoprene biosynthesis, indicating some interaction but lacking detailed quantitative data or strong evidence of direct dependence.",
