    "context": "[11] In this specific case, however, ROS levels did not decrease as a consequence of increased isoprene emission, probably because abscission induction was at this point irreversible. [12] Isoprene, in addition to acting directly as an antioxidant, may also be involved in specific signaling pathways leading to a broader cellular response to abiotic stresses. [13] Cooperating with NO, isoprene was shown to reduce oxidative damage in leaves , and this effect is likely to be dependent upon interactions occurring at the signaling level rather than direct scavenging reactions . [14] The involvement of NO in the signal cascade that initiates the hypersensitive response occurring in plant-pathogen interactions  and its cooperation with isoprene may suggest that a number of other processes are also likely to be affected, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the elicitation of jasmonate and salicylate signaling pathways typically involved in the hypersensitive response . [15] Transcriptomic analyses performed by  indicate that the above-cited processes were triggered early (at 17 DAPF) during abscission induction, especially concerning the up-regulation of genes coding for a jasmonate-induced protein, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. [16] For the latter two genes, a role in the cross talk with ethylene signaling, which is activated downstream , may be hypothesized, along with an interaction with NO signaling, as previously pointed out (; ).  [1] Short-term changes in isoprene emission are primarily determined by availability of the isoprene synthase substrate dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (; ; ; ; ; ), which is synthesized by the MEP pathway.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its role in various biological processes, particularly in response to abiotic stresses in plants. The text highlights isoprene's antioxidant properties and its involvement in signaling pathways that may affect processes such as the hypersensitive response and gene regulation. However, the term 'Process' is too vague and does not specify a particular biological or chemical process, making the relationship less direct.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as isoprene is involved in biological processes but lacks a specific, detailed relationship with the term 'Process' in the context provided.",
