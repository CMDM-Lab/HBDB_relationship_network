    "context": "[4] Moreover, the nutritional stress caused by both BA and MET indirectly reduces the already low assimilate availability to the sinks (i.e. the fruitlets), suggesting that a contribution to isoprene biosynthesis from transported carbohydrates may be ruled out. [5] Taking into account that  observed an increase of Suc and a decrease of starch concentration in the cortex of AFs, it may be hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis in these fruits is supported by both starch degradation and respiration (following Suc breakdown). [6] Specific investigations will be focused on these aspects to shed light on which metabolisms are more active in feeding isoprene biosynthesis in apple fruitlets undergoing a nutritional stress, such as that caused by the thinning treatments. [1] The determination of ABA levels in the cortex allowed the identification of a significant correlation between the hormone content and isoprene emission (Fig. 5). [2] Increased levels of the hormone observed in BA-treated L3 fruitlets (Fig. 4C) concurrently with the up-regulation of the ABA-responsive MdNCED1 gene (MDP0000228070; Fig. 7) suggests an activation of the indirect biosynthetic pathway of the hormone. [3] Moreover, taking into account that the same gene was found to be up-regulated during naphthylacetic acid- and shading-induced apple fruitlet abscission , its specific role in fruit shedding may be hypothesized. [4] It is also interesting that both BA and ABA treatments caused a strong and broad down-regulation of all the NCED genes in C3 fruitlets. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor to isoprene biosynthesis, is discussed in relation to the metabolic processes in apple fruitlets under nutritional stress. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears unrelated to the biochemical processes described, as it typically refers to a legal or formal decision-making process, not a biological or chemical interaction. Therefore, there is no meaningful connection between the two terms in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a complete lack of relevance between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same text but do not interact or relate to each other in any meaningful way.",
