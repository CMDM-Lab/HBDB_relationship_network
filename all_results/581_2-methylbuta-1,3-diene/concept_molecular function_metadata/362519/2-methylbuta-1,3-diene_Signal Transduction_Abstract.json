    "context": "[1] Although research on plant antioxidants has mainly focused on nonvolatile compounds, the involvement of certain volatiles of the isoprenoid family in the protection against oxidative and other abiotic stresses has also been observed. [2] In plants, the common C5 backbone molecules of isoprenoids may derive from two different metabolic pathways: the cytosolic mevalonic acid pathway or the plastidic 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-P (MEP) pathway (; , , ; ; ). [3] Volatile isoprenoids are generally lipophilic, and among this numerous family of compounds, only hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and some diterpenes are able to volatilize at common biological temperatures . [4] Of particular interest is isoprene, a hemiterpene that is known to behave as an antioxidant (; ; ) and as a thylakoid membrane stabilizer that reduces the formation of ROS , and whose indirect role in cooperating with nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive species in the installation of secondary signaling has also been suggested . [5] In addition to acting as antioxidants, volatile isoprenoids are involved in a wide variety of plant responses to exogenous stimuli, conferring protection against high temperatures (; ; ), excessive light radiation (; ), drought (; ; ), salt stress (; ), herbivores , and mechanical wounding , and also playing relevant roles in tritrophic interactions .  [1] To assess a possible role for isoprene in apple fruitlet abscission induction, as well as identify new volatile markers and shed light on the metabolic and physiological pathways in which they may be involved, an experimental approach was adopted similar to that of .  [2] Fruitlet populations with different APs were obtained from either untreated trees or trees sprayed with one of two different types of thinning chemicals, i.e. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile isoprenoid, is discussed in relation to its antioxidant properties and potential roles in plant stress responses. While it is suggested that isoprenoids like isoprene may participate in signaling pathways, the specific connection to signal transduction is not explicitly detailed. The mention of isoprene's role in secondary signaling with reactive species hints at a relationship, but lacks direct evidence or detailed exploration of signal transduction mechanisms involving 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is part of the broader discussion on isoprenoids and their roles in plant signaling and stress responses. However, the context does not provide a detailed or direct connection to signal transduction mechanisms.",
