    "context": " [6] This condition is perceived by the sentinel fruit cortex, in which a primary sugar signaling compatible with abscission induction is triggered.  [7] This signaling would start the shedding process by means of a multiple network of interactions between hormones (mainly ABA and ethylene) and other signaling molecules (i.e. the ROS).  [8] During abscission induction, the production of both isoprene and ABA appears to be coregulated, with the former possibly involved in detoxification from ROS and in the activation of secondary signaling pathways (cross talk with ethylene).  [9] Exogenous ABA treatments are able to magnify fruitlet abscission but unable to affect isoprene emission, thus positioning the involvement of ABA right upstream of abscission induction and not as a side effect of this process. [10] The abscission signal is then transmitted to the abscission zone, most likely through the seeds, whose viability is finally compromised due to a developmental block caused by assimilate shortage. [11] exABA, Exogenous ABA; AZ, abscission zone. [1] As a concluding comment, future applications involving the measurement of isoprene emission at the field level may be useful to predict the fruit load. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to the process of fruit abscission. The signaling pathways involving hormones like ABA and ethylene are crucial for initiating the abscission process, with isoprene potentially playing a role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating secondary signaling pathways. This indicates that isoprene production is part of the broader physiological process of abscission induction in fruit development.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the abscission process, supported by evidence of isoprene's role in detoxification and signaling. The context provides a clear relationship between the compound and the physiological process, indicating its importance in fruit development.",
