    "context": "[3] In abscising apple fruitlets, isoprene biosynthesis was shown to be sustained even with photosynthesis inhibition, which is known to occur soon after MET treatments in apple and persist up to 5 d after the chemical application . [4] Moreover, the nutritional stress caused by both BA and MET indirectly reduces the already low assimilate availability to the sinks (i.e. the fruitlets), suggesting that a contribution to isoprene biosynthesis from transported carbohydrates may be ruled out. [5] Taking into account that  observed an increase of Suc and a decrease of starch concentration in the cortex of AFs, it may be hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis in these fruits is supported by both starch degradation and respiration (following Suc breakdown). [6] Specific investigations will be focused on these aspects to shed light on which metabolisms are more active in feeding isoprene biosynthesis in apple fruitlets undergoing a nutritional stress, such as that caused by the thinning treatments. [1] The determination of ABA levels in the cortex allowed the identification of a significant correlation between the hormone content and isoprene emission (Fig. 5). [2] Increased levels of the hormone observed in BA-treated L3 fruitlets (Fig. 4C) concurrently with the up-regulation of the ABA-responsive MdNCED1 gene (MDP0000228070; Fig. 7) suggests an activation of the indirect biosynthetic pathway of the hormone. [3] Moreover, taking into account that the same gene was found to be up-regulated during naphthylacetic acid- and shading-induced apple fruitlet abscission , its specific role in fruit shedding may be hypothesized.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile compound, is linked to isoprenoid biosynthesis in apple fruitlets. The study indicates that isoprene biosynthesis persists even under conditions that inhibit photosynthesis, suggesting that metabolic pathways, including starch degradation and respiration, contribute to the production of isoprene. This highlights the role of isoprenoid biosynthesis in response to nutritional stress in fruit development.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprenoid biosynthesis, as the context discusses the metabolic processes that support isoprene production, indicating a clear relationship within the framework of plant physiology and biochemistry.",
