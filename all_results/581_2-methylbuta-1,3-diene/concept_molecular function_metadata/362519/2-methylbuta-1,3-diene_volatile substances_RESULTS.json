    "context": "[6] The cv Red Chief statistics are reported in Supplemental Table S2. [7] Given that the protonated mass 69 in plants has been unambiguously identified as isoprene (; ; ; ), whereas the other masses with high Z scores have not always been precisely identified, attention was focused on isoprene. [8] However, because the emission of this volatile compound by apple fruitlets has not yet been reported, specific investigations were conducted by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a flame ionization detector, and additional measurements were performed by PTR-MS on ionization spectra as a function of collision energy to confirm the identity of m/z 69. [9] Taken as a whole, the results of these assessments confirmed that m/z 69 is due to the contribution of protonated isoprene and not to fragments of other volatiles (further details are provided in Supplemental Fig. S2). [1] Z scores were calculated by ranking fruitlets in two categories (AFs and nonabscising fruitlets). [2] Only associations with Z scores greater than or equal to 2 are reported, sorted by increasing mass. [3] f, Fragments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, identified as isoprene, is discussed as a volatile compound emitted by apple fruitlets. The study focuses on confirming the identity of this volatile substance through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and other analytical methods. The relationship is significant as isoprene is categorized under volatile substances, highlighting its role in plant emissions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and volatile substances, as the context emphasizes its identification and analysis as a specific volatile compound emitted by plants, supported by experimental data.",
