        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned in relation to ionization measurements of its fragments during PTR-MS (Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry) analysis. The study investigates how collision energy affects the ionization of isoprene fragments, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and the ionization process. However, the specific role of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene in the broader context of the study is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of the relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is directly involved in the ionization process being studied, but the context does not provide extensive details on their interaction or significance beyond the ionization measurements.",
