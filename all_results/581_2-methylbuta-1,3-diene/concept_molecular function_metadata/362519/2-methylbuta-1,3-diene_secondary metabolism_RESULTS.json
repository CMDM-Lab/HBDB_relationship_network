[3] Bars represent sd (n = 3). [4] Statistically significant differences as determined by Student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s t test are indicated with one asterisk (P \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 0.05).  [1] To gain a global view of the possible transcriptional regulation mechanisms associated with the increase of both isoprene emission and ABA content in the fruitlet cortex, attention was focused on the secondary metabolism by using a double approach based upon enrichment analysis and MapMan analysis (see Supplementary Material).  [2] Microarray expression data produced by  and archived in the ArrayExpress database (accession no.  [3] A-MEXP-1852) were used for this, although the probe set adopted did not guarantee a total coverage of the apple transcriptome.  [4] Both analyses showed that during abscission induction in L3 fruitlets, some pathways were preferentially activated (Supplemental Fig. S6) and the corresponding genes were overrepresented among those differentially expressed (Supplemental Table S5): terpenoids (isoprenoids), phenylpropanoids, and carotenoids.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound related to isoprene emissions, is linked to secondary metabolism through its role in the transcriptional regulation mechanisms associated with isoprene production and abscission in fruitlets. The study highlights the activation of specific metabolic pathways, including terpenoids, which are derived from secondary metabolism, indicating a significant relationship between the compound and metabolic processes in the plant.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and secondary metabolism, as the context discusses the compound's involvement in metabolic pathways and gene expression related to isoprene emission, supported by experimental data.",
