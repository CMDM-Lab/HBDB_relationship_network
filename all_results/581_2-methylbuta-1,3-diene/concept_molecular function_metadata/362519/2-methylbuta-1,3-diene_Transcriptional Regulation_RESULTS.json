    "context": "[2] Small lateral (A), big lateral (B), and big central (C) fruitlets of control (circles and continuous line) and ABA-treated (100 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191; squares and dashed line) trees are shown. [3] Bars represent sd (n = 3). [4] Statistically significant differences as determined by Student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s t test are indicated with one asterisk (P \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 0.05).  [1] To gain a global view of the possible transcriptional regulation mechanisms associated with the increase of both isoprene emission and ABA content in the fruitlet cortex, attention was focused on the secondary metabolism by using a double approach based upon enrichment analysis and MapMan analysis (see Supplementary Material).  [2] Microarray expression data produced by  and archived in the ArrayExpress database (accession no.  [3] A-MEXP-1852) were used for this, although the probe set adopted did not guarantee a total coverage of the apple transcriptome.  [4] Both analyses showed that during abscission induction in L3 fruitlets, some pathways were preferentially activated (Supplemental Fig. S6) and the corresponding genes were overrepresented among those differentially expressed (Supplemental Table S5): terpenoids (isoprenoids), phenylpropanoids, and carotenoids.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound related to isoprene emissions, is indirectly linked to transcriptional regulation mechanisms associated with secondary metabolism in fruitlets. The study focuses on how transcriptional regulation may influence isoprene emission and ABA content, suggesting that the expression of certain genes related to terpenoids and other pathways is affected during abscission induction. However, the specific role of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene in transcriptional regulation is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is part of the broader discussion on isoprene emissions and transcriptional regulation, but the direct relationship between the compound and transcriptional mechanisms is not thoroughly explored.",
