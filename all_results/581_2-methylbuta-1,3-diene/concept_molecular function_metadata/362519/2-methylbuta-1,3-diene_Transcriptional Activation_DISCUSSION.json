    "context": " [3] This will, in turn, feed not only isoprene biosynthesis  but also the other downstream pathways that rely upon the same substrate, including ABA biosynthesis via carotenoids (Fig. 7).  [4] The BA thinning treatment was shown to up-regulate the expression of three different DXSs according to the fruit class, and thus developmental stage, considered.  [5] Among these three genes, MDP0000793656 was up-regulated only in AFs of the L1 and L3 classes.  [6] This up-regulation occurred at 19 DAPF and was preceded in both cases by an increased emission of isoprene (at 17 DAPF), as measured in BA-treated fruitlets.  [7] Nevertheless, this difference was statistically significant only in L3 fruitlets, which also showed a more sustained ABA production than the untreated control at the same time point.  [8] It may therefore be hypothesized that the dramatic up-regulation of the apple candidate DXS gene may have been required to provide an adequate amount of substrate to sustain the high biosynthetic rates of both compounds.  [9] It is also worthy of note that MDP0000793656 putatively encodes a class II DXS, whose function is more related to the secondary metabolism rather than a housekeeping role . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to transcriptional activation through its role in isoprene biosynthesis and the regulation of gene expression associated with this pathway. The up-regulation of specific DXS genes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of isoprene and ABA, suggests that transcriptional activation is necessary to enhance the production of these compounds. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the metabolic pathway than on direct transcriptional mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is linked to transcriptional activation through the up-regulation of DXS genes in the context of isoprene biosynthesis, but the specifics of this activation are not thoroughly explored.",
