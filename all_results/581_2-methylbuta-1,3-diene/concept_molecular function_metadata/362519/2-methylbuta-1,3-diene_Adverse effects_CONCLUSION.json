    "context": " [6] This condition is perceived by the sentinel fruit cortex, in which a primary sugar signaling compatible with abscission induction is triggered.  [7] This signaling would start the shedding process by means of a multiple network of interactions between hormones (mainly ABA and ethylene) and other signaling molecules (i.e. the ROS).  [8] During abscission induction, the production of both isoprene and ABA appears to be coregulated, with the former possibly involved in detoxification from ROS and in the activation of secondary signaling pathways (cross talk with ethylene).  [9] Exogenous ABA treatments are able to magnify fruitlet abscission but unable to affect isoprene emission, thus positioning the involvement of ABA right upstream of abscission induction and not as a side effect of this process. [10] The abscission signal is then transmitted to the abscission zone, most likely through the seeds, whose viability is finally compromised due to a developmental block caused by assimilate shortage. [11] exABA, Exogenous ABA; AZ, abscission zone. [1] As a concluding comment, future applications involving the measurement of isoprene emission at the field level may be useful to predict the fruit load. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its role in the signaling pathways involved in fruit abscission. While the text mentions isoprene's potential involvement in detoxification from reactive oxygen species (ROS), it does not explicitly detail any adverse effects associated with isoprene or its production. The relationship is more about its signaling role rather than direct adverse effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in the context of signaling and detoxification, but there is no detailed discussion of specific adverse effects related to its presence or production.",
        "score": 2
