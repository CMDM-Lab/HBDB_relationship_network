    "context": "[2] The data clearly showed that whole-plant isoprene fluxes increased dynamically and strongly under the HDSs, although the plants developed fewer and smaller leaves under these conditions. [3] The poplars were able to tolerate PS and CS events but paid for their stress adaption with temporarily reduced A and C gain. [4] However, the higher photosynthesis rates at the end of the recovery phase suggest that the impact of periodic and chronic HDSs on growth and biomass can be compensated under unstressed conditions in due time. [5] The comparison of photosynthesis, growth, and stress parameters in the IE and NE poplars suggests that isoprene emission does not enhance plant stress mitigation under the future climate in poplar.  [1] The experiments were conducted with four genotypes of Grey poplar (Populus \u00c3\u2014 canescens [INRA clone 7171-B4]; syn.  [2] Populus tremula \u00c3\u2014 Populus alba).  [3] Two IE genotypes (wild type and PcISPS:GUS/GFP, in which the PcISPS promoter was fused to the GUS and GFP reporter genes; for details, see ) and two well-characterized NE transgenic genotypes (35S::PcISPS-RNAi lines RA1 and RA2; ; ) were used.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from poplar plants during photosynthesis. The study indicates that while isoprene fluxes increased under certain stress conditions, it does not enhance the plants' ability to mitigate stress or improve photosynthesis rates significantly. The relationship suggests that isoprene emission is a response to stress rather than a direct enhancer of photosynthetic efficiency.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) is linked to photosynthesis through its emission dynamics in response to stress conditions in poplar plants. However, the context indicates that this emission does not significantly enhance photosynthesis, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
