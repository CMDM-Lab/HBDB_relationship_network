    "context": " [9] The [CO2] in the PS and CS scenarios was elevated as in EC (500 \u00c2\u00b5L CO2 L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191). [10] The CO2 concentrations in all scenarios followed naturally occurring diurnal variations. [11] The elevated CO2 environment in the EC, PS, and CS scenarios was created by the injection of pure CO2 (120 \u00c2\u00b5L L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) into the air stream of the ambient [CO2]. [12] In our analysis, the AC scenario is the direct control of the PS and CS scenarios, while the EC scenario was used to compare the reported inhibitory effect of elevated [CO2] on leaf-level isoprene emission (; ) with canopy-scale dynamics . [13] There was no attempt to separate temperature and drought factors in this study. [1] The experiment was repeated twice with exchanging the scenarios between the phytotron chambers and the position of each genotype in the subchambers to avoid position effects. [2] Genotypes were pooled according to their isoprene emission capabilities: wild-type and GUS/GFP genotypes to isoprene-emitters and RA1 and RA2 to nonemitters. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound also known as isoprene, is indirectly related to inhibitors through the discussion of elevated CO2 effects on isoprene emissions. The study examines how elevated CO2 concentrations influence isoprene release from different genotypes, but does not provide specific details on inhibitors that affect this process. Thus, while there is a mention of isoprene emissions, the relationship with inhibitors is not explicitly defined or explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and inhibitors, as they are both part of the broader discussion on isoprene emissions under elevated CO2 conditions, but without detailed interaction or specific mention of inhibitors affecting isoprene.",
        "score": 2
