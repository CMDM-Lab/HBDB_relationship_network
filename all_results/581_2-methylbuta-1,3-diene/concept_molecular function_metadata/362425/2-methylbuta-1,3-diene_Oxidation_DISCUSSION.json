    "context": "[5] However, LOX emissions upon dehydration have been detected as early stress responses on cut grass (; ). [6] These drought treatments were, in contrast to our climate change scenarios, rather extreme and artificial and resulted in fast dehydration that normally does not occur in natural drought progression. [7] It was proposed that, under oxidative stress, a substantial fraction of isoprene is oxidized inside the leaf to MVK and/or MACR . [8] Here, we could not detect any isoprene oxidation products in measurements at the plant level (with a proton-transfer reaction-quadrupole mass spectrometer [PTR-QMS]) or at the leaf level (with a proton-transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometer [PTR-ToF-MS]). [1] While HDSs positively triggered isoprene emission rates and NEE, we observed a long-lasting impairment of plant growth and leaf pigmentation (anthocyanins and flavonols) in both IE and NE plants during HDSs and during the recovery phases. [2] The strong correlation between MeOH emission and RLER clearly demonstrates that MeOH is a suitable indicator of overall plant growth. [3] The phylogenic emission of MeOH is primarily associated with leaf expansion and cell elongation (; ; ), and developing poplar leaves emit significantly more compared with mature ones . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its oxidation under oxidative stress conditions in plants. The text suggests that isoprene can be oxidized to products like MVK and MACR, indicating a direct relationship between isoprene and oxidation processes. However, the study did not detect these oxidation products at the plant or leaf level, suggesting that while oxidation is a relevant process, its detection and quantification in this context may be limited.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the oxidation of isoprene is mentioned in the context of oxidative stress, indicating a significant relationship. However, the lack of detected oxidation products limits the strength of this connection.",
