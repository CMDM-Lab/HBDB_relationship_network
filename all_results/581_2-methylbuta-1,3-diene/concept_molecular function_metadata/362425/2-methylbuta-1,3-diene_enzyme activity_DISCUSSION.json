    "context": " [4] This effect was less pronounced when analyzing the standard emission factor at the leaf level (1.5 times higher than in ambient [CO2]), while the overall plant response was much stronger (9 times higher expressed based on the LA, 7 times higher expressed per plant).  [5] This increase in the overall plant isoprene fluxes is most likely a combination of the temperature and drought on isoprene emission.  [6] At the plant scale, the measured air temperature (33\u00c2\u00b0C) and leaf temperature (33\u00c2\u00b0C\u00e2\u20ac\u201c37\u00c2\u00b0C; Supplemental Fig. S4) during HDSs were higher than at the leaf level (30\u00c2\u00b0C, leaf temperature).  [7] As temperature is the main driver of ISOPRENE SYNTHASE (ISPS) enzyme activity, the strong increase in the isoprene emission during HDSs is probably a combined function of enhanced ISPS activity and higher substrate availability .  [8] Drought can also promote isoprene emission, albeit with a concomitant decrease in photosynthesis (; ), probably as a result of decreased ci (Table I).  [9] The ascent in canopy isoprene emission over time in the PS and CS scenarios reflects long-term acclimation to high temperatures. [10] Here, gene activation may lead to higher ISPS amounts . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to enzyme activity through the role of isoprene synthase (ISPS). The study indicates that increased temperatures enhance ISPS enzyme activity, leading to higher isoprene emissions from plants. This relationship suggests that enzyme activity is a critical factor in the biosynthesis of isoprene, particularly under conditions of temperature stress and drought.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and enzyme activity, supported by evidence of increased ISPS activity correlating with higher isoprene emissions. The context provides a clear relationship between temperature effects and enzyme function in isoprene production.",
