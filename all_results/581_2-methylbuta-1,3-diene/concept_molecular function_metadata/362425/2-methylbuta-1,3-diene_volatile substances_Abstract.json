    "context": "[4] Interactions between heat and drought under predicted elevated [CO2]  generate complex, often nonadditive physiological responses. [5] Such effects cannot be predicted by single-factor analyses and highlight the importance of carrying out controlled, multistress scenarios to investigate plant performance under future climate conditions (; ). [1] Photosynthesis, respiration, and photorespiration are the three dominating processes determining carbon (C) exchange and C metabolism in plants (; ). [2] In addition, the emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributes to the overall C exchange of plants, with isoprene being the most abundant volatile compound that is released by vegetation, in particular by forest ecosystems . [3] Due to its high reactivity, isoprene can significantly influence the oxidative capacity of the troposphere as well as cloud formation, with important consequences for air quality, climate, ecosystem processes, and even human health (; ). [1] In terms of C and energy, isoprene biosynthesis is a costly investment for the plant (; ) and is biochemically (; ; ; ) and transcriptionally (; ) under the control of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and [CO2]. [2] Isoprene synthesis is light dependent ; however, emissions can become uncoupled from photosynthesis under stress that impairs net CO2 assimilation (A) and makes plants rely on alternative (old) C sources (; ; ; ).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is identified as a significant biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, particularly in forest ecosystems. The emission of isoprene contributes to the overall exchange of carbon and energy in plants and plays a crucial role in influencing atmospheric chemistry and climate. The relationship between isoprene and volatile substances is highlighted through its impact on air quality and ecosystem processes, indicating that isoprene is a key example of a volatile substance with substantial ecological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and volatile substances, as isoprene is explicitly mentioned as a major VOC affecting carbon exchange and atmospheric processes. The context provides evidence of its ecological importance, though it does not delve into specific quantitative data.",
