    "context": "[1] Online determination of isoprene (m69), MeOH (m33), m71, LOX products (m99 and m101), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (m137 and m205, respectively) was conducted simultaneously to the gas-exchange measurements using a high-sensitivity PTR-QMS (Ionicon Analytik) at a sampling flow rate of 200 mL min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191. [2] The PTR-QMS switched between the two infrared gas analyzers every 2 d. [3] The details of the PTR-QMS operating parameters and the calibration procedures are given elsewhere (; ). [4] In addition, the sum of the isoprene oxidation products MVK and MACR was calculated at m71, after subtracting the amount of isoprene occurring as stable 13C isotope (i.e. [5] 13C212C3H8; 0.305% of m69). [6] The first 1 min of each measurement after switching the subchambers was always discarded in order to avoid any memory effects. [7] VOC concentrations in the inlet air of the subchambers were used as background and therefore subtracted from the outlet concentrations every 20 min. ",
