    "context": "[1] In terms of C and energy, isoprene biosynthesis is a costly investment for the plant (; ) and is biochemically (; ; ; ) and transcriptionally (; ) under the control of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and [CO2]. [2] Isoprene synthesis is light dependent ; however, emissions can become uncoupled from photosynthesis under stress that impairs net CO2 assimilation (A) and makes plants rely on alternative (old) C sources (; ; ; ). [3] While isoprene biosynthesis and emission correlate with fluctuations in leaf temperature (; ), increases in atmospheric [CO2] have a more ambiguous effect on isoprene emission. [4] At the leaf level, isoprene biosynthesis and its consequent emission in poplar (Populus spp.) is inhibited in elevated [CO2] environments (; ), but the inhibitory effect is reduced at temperatures higher than 30\u00c2\u00b0C . [5] Canopy-scale flux measurements report enhanced isoprene emission at high [CO2] due to strongly enhanced canopy leaf dry mass and leaf area index . [6] Thus, for predicting future isoprene emissions, one has to consider not only the direct effects of global drivers on the isoprene emission capacity (e.g. [7] light, [CO2], and temperature) but also indirect effects resulting from changes in the overall net primary productivity (; ) and the impact of stress (e.g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in plants, which is influenced by environmental factors. However, there is no mention or connection to signal peptide peptidase activity, which is an enzymatic function unrelated to isoprene biosynthesis. The two terms appear in the same context but do not interact or relate to each other in any meaningful way.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and signal peptide peptidase activity, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect connection or relevance.",
