    "context": "[1] In terms of C and energy, isoprene biosynthesis is a costly investment for the plant (; ) and is biochemically (; ; ; ) and transcriptionally (; ) under the control of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and [CO2]. [2] Isoprene synthesis is light dependent ; however, emissions can become uncoupled from photosynthesis under stress that impairs net CO2 assimilation (A) and makes plants rely on alternative (old) C sources (; ; ; ). [3] While isoprene biosynthesis and emission correlate with fluctuations in leaf temperature (; ), increases in atmospheric [CO2] have a more ambiguous effect on isoprene emission. [4] At the leaf level, isoprene biosynthesis and its consequent emission in poplar (Populus spp.) is inhibited in elevated [CO2] environments (; ), but the inhibitory effect is reduced at temperatures higher than 30\u00c2\u00b0C . [5] Canopy-scale flux measurements report enhanced isoprene emission at high [CO2] due to strongly enhanced canopy leaf dry mass and leaf area index . [6] Thus, for predicting future isoprene emissions, one has to consider not only the direct effects of global drivers on the isoprene emission capacity (e.g. [7] light, [CO2], and temperature) but also indirect effects resulting from changes in the overall net primary productivity (; ) and the impact of stress (e.g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis and emission in plants, which can be inhibited by environmental factors such as elevated CO2 levels. The text indicates that while isoprene production is influenced by various conditions, the specific role of inhibitors in this process is not elaborated upon, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and inhibitors, as the context mentions inhibition of isoprene biosynthesis under certain conditions, but does not provide detailed information on specific inhibitors or their mechanisms.",
