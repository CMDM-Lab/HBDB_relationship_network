    "context": "[5] That IE plants somehow must pay for the release of C as isoprene was recently reported for transgenic IE tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum; ). [6] These authors showed that drought stress resulted in slower growth of IE plants relative to the NE wild-type or vector control plants. [7] In the control scenarios, we observed a lower cumulative net C gain in IE plants under ambient [CO2] (Fig. 7). [8] This difference, however, vanished under elevated [CO2] conditions, concomitant with decreases in the metabolic differences between IE and NE plants , possibly due to the inhibitory effect of elevated [CO2] on the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway flux  and isoprene biosynthesis (; ).  [1] The strongest difference that was observed between the genotypes was an impaired ETR in the NE plants during each stress cycle (Fig. 2; PS) and when stress progressed (Fig. 2; CS).  [2] In contrast, the ETR in IE plants remained stable or became even slightly increased, possibly due to increased leaf temperatures during HDSs (; ).  [3] Different tolerance of ETR in IE and NE Grey poplar upon abiotic (heat and light) stress has been reported previously (; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in plants under varying CO2 conditions. The mention of inhibitors refers to the inhibitory effect of elevated CO2 on the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway, which is crucial for isoprene production. This suggests a significant relationship where elevated CO2 acts as an inhibitor of isoprene biosynthesis, impacting the metabolic processes in isoprene-emitting (IE) plants compared to non-emitting (NE) plants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and inhibitors, as the context provides evidence of elevated CO2 inhibiting isoprene biosynthesis through the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway, indicating a clear metabolic interaction.",
