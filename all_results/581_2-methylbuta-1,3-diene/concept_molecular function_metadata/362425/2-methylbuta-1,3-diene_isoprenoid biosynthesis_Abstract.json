    "context": "[1] In terms of C and energy, isoprene biosynthesis is a costly investment for the plant (; ) and is biochemically (; ; ; ) and transcriptionally (; ) under the control of environmental factors such as light, temperature, and [CO2]. [2] Isoprene synthesis is light dependent ; however, emissions can become uncoupled from photosynthesis under stress that impairs net CO2 assimilation (A) and makes plants rely on alternative (old) C sources (; ; ; ). [3] While isoprene biosynthesis and emission correlate with fluctuations in leaf temperature (; ), increases in atmospheric [CO2] have a more ambiguous effect on isoprene emission. [4] At the leaf level, isoprene biosynthesis and its consequent emission in poplar (Populus spp.) is inhibited in elevated [CO2] environments (; ), but the inhibitory effect is reduced at temperatures higher than 30\u00c2\u00b0C . [5] Canopy-scale flux measurements report enhanced isoprene emission at high [CO2] due to strongly enhanced canopy leaf dry mass and leaf area index . [6] Thus, for predicting future isoprene emissions, one has to consider not only the direct effects of global drivers on the isoprene emission capacity (e.g. [7] light, [CO2], and temperature) but also indirect effects resulting from changes in the overall net primary productivity (; ) and the impact of stress (e.g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a key intermediate in isoprene biosynthesis, is discussed in relation to the biochemical and environmental factors influencing isoprene production in plants. The synthesis of isoprene is highlighted as a significant metabolic process that is affected by light, temperature, and CO2 levels, indicating a direct relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprenoid biosynthesis, particularly under varying environmental conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprenoid biosynthesis, as the context discusses the biochemical pathways and environmental influences on isoprene production, which directly involves 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene as a precursor.",
