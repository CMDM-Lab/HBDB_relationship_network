    "context": "[6] When stress limits resources, plants must balance primary and secondary metabolism, investing in either plant growth or protective strategies. [7] We did not observe an accumulation of polyphenols (anthocyanins and flavonols) in the leaves of either the IE or NE genotype under stress exposure. [8] However, the pool of polyphenols increased under elevated [CO2] compared with ambient [CO2] conditions (Supplemental Fig. S7), as reported previously . [1] In addition to the general physiological performance of Grey poplar under predicted future short-term extremes, we also aimed to quantify the environmental impact on transgenic poplar genotypes with an almost complete absence of isoprene emission . [2] This interest is motivated by the proposed function of isoprene in plant stress mitigation  and the potential for biotechnological generation or the phenotyping of low-isoprene-emitting or NE poplars as a strategy to minimize the harmful effects of large poplar plantations on local air quality and human health (; ). [3] The latter issue is especially important because the pollution of the atmosphere by isoprene is predicted to increase due to the promotion of new poplar plantations worldwide . [1] Globally, the IE and NE genotypes performed similarly under the different stress scenarios, indicating that the absence of isoprene emission marginally influences physiology, even under PS and CS exposure.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor to isoprene, is discussed in relation to its environmental impacts, particularly concerning plant stress responses and air quality. The study highlights the potential for biotechnological approaches to reduce isoprene emissions from poplar plantations, which could mitigate negative effects on local air quality and human health. However, the direct relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and environmental impacts is not deeply explored, focusing instead on broader implications of isoprene emissions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is linked to environmental impacts through its role in isoprene emissions. While the context discusses the implications of these emissions, it does not provide extensive details on their direct relationship.",
        "score": 3
