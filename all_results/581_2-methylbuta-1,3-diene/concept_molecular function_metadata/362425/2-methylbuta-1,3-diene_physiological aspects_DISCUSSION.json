    "context": "[1] In addition to the general physiological performance of Grey poplar under predicted future short-term extremes, we also aimed to quantify the environmental impact on transgenic poplar genotypes with an almost complete absence of isoprene emission . [2] This interest is motivated by the proposed function of isoprene in plant stress mitigation  and the potential for biotechnological generation or the phenotyping of low-isoprene-emitting or NE poplars as a strategy to minimize the harmful effects of large poplar plantations on local air quality and human health (; ). [3] The latter issue is especially important because the pollution of the atmosphere by isoprene is predicted to increase due to the promotion of new poplar plantations worldwide . [1] Globally, the IE and NE genotypes performed similarly under the different stress scenarios, indicating that the absence of isoprene emission marginally influences physiology, even under PS and CS exposure. [2] This result is in accordance with an earlier observation in which comparable growth rates, biomass yield, and (projected) CO2 uptake were reported in IE and NE plants grown for two vegetation periods under seminatural conditions . [3] The authors presumed that the absence of any climate extreme in their field trail might mask different sensitivities to abiotic stress and proposed experiments under more harsh environmental conditions to prove the potential stress-alleviating function of isoprene. [4] Here, after HDSs, we observed similar growth performance in both genotypes (Fig. 5). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is a precursor to isoprene, is indirectly related to physiological aspects of Grey poplar trees. The study examines the physiological performance of transgenic poplar genotypes with and without isoprene emissions under environmental stress. The findings suggest that the absence of isoprene emission has a marginal influence on the physiological performance of the plants, indicating that isoprene may play a role in stress mitigation, but its absence does not significantly alter growth or biomass yield under the tested conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and physiological aspects is discussed in terms of isoprene's potential role in plant stress mitigation, but the specifics of this relationship are not deeply explored.",
