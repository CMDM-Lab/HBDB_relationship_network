    "context": "[4] The PS scenario reduced the uptake of C by approximately 20% and 23% in IE and NE plants, respectively, compared with that under enhanced [CO2]. [5] In the CS scenario, the plants fixed less C than in PS (IE plants, \u00e2\u02c6\u201933%; NE plants, \u00e2\u02c6\u201938%). [6] Concurrent with the reduction of net C uptake, the amount of C lost as isoprene increased in the IE plants by 6 to 9 times during the periodic or chronic HDSs compared with control conditions. [7] The percentage of photosynthetic C lost as isoprene (daily) increased progressively as the water scarcity became more severe (Supplemental Fig. S6), finally reaching 5.8% at day 20 in the CS scenario. [1] Net C uptake in IE (black bars) and NE (red bars) poplars in the four scenarios (AC, EC, PS, and CS) at the end of the experiment. [2] Net C uptake was calculated based on overall plant fluxes of CO2 and isoprene (see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Materials and Methods\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), and values for IE and NE plants in each scenario are given as means of four subchambers \u00c2\u00b1 se. [3] The dashed line indicates the reference value of 87 g C m\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 (the mean in the AC scenario for IE plants). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to photosynthesis as a byproduct of carbon fixation in plants. The study indicates that under certain conditions, such as water scarcity, the amount of carbon lost as isoprene increases significantly, suggesting a trade-off between carbon uptake through photosynthesis and isoprene emission. This highlights the role of isoprene in the photosynthetic process and its impact on carbon dynamics in plants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and photosynthesis, as the context discusses how isoprene emissions relate to carbon uptake during photosynthesis, particularly under stress conditions. The quantitative data on carbon loss as isoprene supports this relationship.",
