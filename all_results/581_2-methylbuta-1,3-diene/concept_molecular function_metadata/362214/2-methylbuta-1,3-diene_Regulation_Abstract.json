    "context": "[5] We found that feeding DOX stimulated the rate of isoprene emission only when leaves became starved for carbon. [6] We also found that a large and variable proportion of the total DMAPP in leaves is located outside the chloroplast and is, thus, not available for isoprene emission. [1] DOX-d2 was used to investigate properties of isoprene synthase, especially the affinity of isoprene synthase for its substrate DMAPP. [2] In addition, we studied the regulation of the MEP pathway and its ability to supply a regulated amount of DMAPP for isoprene synthesis during and after heatflecks. [1] Feeding DOX-d2 (2.94 mm) caused the emitted isoprene to become labeled with deuterium (Fig. 1). [2] The first deuterium-labeled isoprene was emitted approximately 10 to 15 min after the onset of feeding, and the degree of labeling increased continuously over the next 2 h until a rather constant level was reached (Fig. 1). [3] When the DOX-d2 solution was replaced with water, the degree of deuterium labeling of isoprene decreased after about 20 min and was further reduced to low levels in about 2 h (Fig. 1). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves and the regulation of the MEP pathway that supplies DMAPP, a substrate for isoprene synthesis. The study highlights the regulatory mechanisms that control isoprene production, particularly under conditions of carbon starvation and heat stress, indicating a significant relationship between isoprene emission and its regulatory pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and regulation, as the context discusses the regulation of the MEP pathway and its role in controlling isoprene synthesis, supported by experimental observations.",
