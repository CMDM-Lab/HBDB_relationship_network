    "context": "[3] Heat also likely increased the activity of xylulose kinase and may have increased the rate of arrival of DOX-d2 through effects on transpiration. [4] However, these effects were much smaller than the relief of feedback inhibition on DXS, and so heat stimulated production of unlabeled isoprene more than of labeled isoprene. [5] However, following the heating, leaves had a net negative carbon balance and, presumably, GAP and pyruvate were in limited supply. [6] Labeled isoprene was emitted at about the rate it was before the heatfleck, showing that the regulation of isoprene emission following a heatfleck depends on availability of substrate rather than changes in isoprene synthase activity. [7] Even heat stress severe enough to eliminate photosynthesis does not appear to affect the capacity to convert DOX to isoprene. [8] Draining pools of intermediates at temperatures above 35\u00c2\u00b0C may account for the reduction in isoprene emission seen when leaves are above 35\u00c2\u00b0C for more than 15 min . [1] The hypothesized regulation of the MEP pathway in response to the various treatments is summarized in Table I. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound (isoprene), is discussed in relation to its emission regulation following heat stress in leaves. The regulation of isoprene emission is influenced by substrate availability rather than changes in isoprene synthase activity. This indicates a significant relationship between the compound's emission and regulatory mechanisms under environmental stress conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and regulation, as the context discusses how isoprene emission is regulated by substrate availability during heat stress, indicating a clear biological and chemical interaction.",
