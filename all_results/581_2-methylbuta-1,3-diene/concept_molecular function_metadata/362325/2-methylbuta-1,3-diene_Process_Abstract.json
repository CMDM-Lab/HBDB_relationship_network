    "context": "[2] On this day the plume (blue box in Fig. 1B) was remote from isoprene sources, resulting in average measured isoprene concentrations of 0.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.2 ppbv; these concentrations are lower than those observed on the 12 July flight by a factor of 3. Thus, ambient VOC reactivity was sufficiently low that background levels of carbon monoxide and methane contributed substantially to hydroxyl radical (OH) loss rates . [3] Supporting onboard measurements of solar actinic flux, radical precursor concentrations, boundary layer height, and wind speed suggest that the Thomas Hill plume should exhibit ozone formation rates and yields intermediate between the Cumberland and Johnsonville plumes as a result of NOxconcentration differences alone. [4] The relatively low VOC reactivity characteristic of the region resulted in delayed net ozone production and the lower observed yield of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc2 ozone molecules per NOx emitted from the Thomas Hill plant (Fig. 3C). [1] A second illustration of the dependence of ozone production processes on the ambient concentration of isoprene is afforded by consideration of the partitioning of the oxidized nitrogen products in these plumes. [2] The major products of atmospheric NOx oxidation are HNO3 and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other organic nitrates . [3] High ambient VOC concentrations lead to ozone formation initiated by the peroxy radical (RO2) + NO reaction in the cycle catalyzed by NOx (Fig. 1A). [4] Low ambient VOC concentrations increase the relative importance of the OH + NO2 reaction, thereby favoring HNO3 formation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its ambient concentrations and their impact on ozone formation processes. The text highlights how varying levels of isoprene influence the chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the subsequent production of ozone. However, the term 'Process' is too vague and does not specify a particular mechanism or pathway, making the relationship less direct.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the general concept of 'Process' related to ozone formation. While isoprene's role in atmospheric chemistry is acknowledged, the lack of specificity regarding 'Process' limits the depth of their relationship.",
