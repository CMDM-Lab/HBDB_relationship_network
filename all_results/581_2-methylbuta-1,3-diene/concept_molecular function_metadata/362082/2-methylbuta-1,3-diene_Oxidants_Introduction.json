    "context": "Several inventories suggested that the amount of BVOC is more than the anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the global scale (Zimmerman, 1979; Lamb et al., 1987; Muller, 1992; Guenther et al., 1995). Among various species of BVOC, isoprene and monoterpenes are the abundant BVOC (Zimmerman et al., 1978). BVOCs play an important role in atmospheric chemistry because they can photochemically react with NO x and enhance the production of ozone in the troposphere (Fehsenfeld, 1992; Rosselle, 1994; Simpson et al., 1995). Isoprene in BVOC is reported to be more reactive than most anthropogenic VOCs (Stockwell and Kuhn, 1998), because it plays an important role due to the generation of oxidant. In addition, it is reported that the increase in average temperature due to global warming (IPCC, 2001) may cause an increase in BVOC emission, and consequently, the photochemical oxidant concentration can rise when more BVOC reacts photochemically with NO x (Pun et al., 2002; Hanna et al., 2001; Pierce et al., 1998). Therefore, it is important to monitor BVOC emissions in order to correctly assess photochemical oxidant concentrations in the future. In spite of its adverse effects, there is no clear consensus as to the purpose of BVOC production by vegetation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a type of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), is implicated in atmospheric chemistry as it can photochemically react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to enhance the production of ozone, a significant oxidant. The text highlights the role of BVOCs, including isoprene, in generating oxidants and suggests that increased emissions due to global warming could lead to higher concentrations of photochemical oxidants, emphasizing the importance of monitoring these emissions for environmental assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and oxidants, as the context discusses how BVOCs contribute to the formation of oxidants through photochemical reactions. This relationship is supported by evidence of their role in atmospheric chemistry and potential environmental impacts.",
