    "context": "Second, surfaces should be inert to prevent losses due to uptake and chemical reactions, and third, the materials should be transparent to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the 400\u2013700nm wavelength range. The potential for analyte adsorption losses generally increases with decreasing vapor pressure (which is a function of the molecular weight and boiling point). Isoprene (C5H8) has a boiling point of 34\u00b0C while MT (C10H16) and SQT (C15H24) have boiling points in the range of 155\u2013175\u00b0C and 240\u2013275\u00b0C, respectively. Calculated saturation gas-phase concentrations for SQT, MT and isoprene (at 25\u00b0C and 1atm pressure) range from 101 to 105 ppmv and are several orders of magnitude greater than typical BVOC mixing ratios achieved in enclosure experiments. However, adsorptive losses occur at mixing ratios well below saturation and have been observed at low ppbv levels, and they can be a significant fraction of the total signal (Helmig et al., 2004). Therefore, it is important to choose materials with low surface areas and low affinities for these analytes. This is especially important for heavier compounds such as SQT. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its vapor pressure and the effects of physical agents like pressure on its behavior in the gas phase. The relationship is highlighted through the mention of how vapor pressure influences analyte adsorption losses, which are critical for understanding the behavior of volatile organic compounds in experimental setups. However, the specific interaction between isoprene and pressure as a physical agent is not deeply explored beyond its general influence on vapor pressure.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the impact of pressure on the vapor behavior of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, indicating a connection between the two terms. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration or quantitative data.",
