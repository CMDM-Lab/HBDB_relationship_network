    "context": "Also, the leaf orientation can be controlled to be perpendicular to the light source. Leaf cuvettes are generally designed for photosynthesis studies, but with some modifications, they can also be used for BVOC emission measurements. Isoprene is extremely volatile, which reduces the risk of wall losses (see Section 5), and isoprene emission rates from many trees can be 10\u20131000 times greater than those for MT or SQT. The resulting high concentrations and negligible analyte losses typically make leaf cuvettes suitable for studying temperature and light effects on isoprene emissions (Guenther et al., 1991; Harley et al., 1996). The internal surface area of a leaf cuvette is large relative to the amount of biomass that is enclosed. Materials used in commercial systems are generally not designed to be chemically inert towards heavier BVOC, and semi-volatile and reactive compounds are prone to be lost in a leaf cuvette. Synthetic materials used in commercial leaf cuvettes have also been found to create analytical interferences from out-gassing (Harley, P., National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, C.O., Helmig, D., unpublished results).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission rates from trees under varying light conditions. The study emphasizes the importance of light effects on isoprene emissions, indicating that leaf cuvettes can be modified to measure these emissions effectively. The relationship highlights how light influences the production of isoprene, a volatile organic compound, during photosynthesis, suggesting a direct connection between light exposure and isoprene emission rates.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and light effects, as the context discusses how light influences isoprene emissions, supported by evidence from studies on leaf cuvettes designed for this purpose.",
