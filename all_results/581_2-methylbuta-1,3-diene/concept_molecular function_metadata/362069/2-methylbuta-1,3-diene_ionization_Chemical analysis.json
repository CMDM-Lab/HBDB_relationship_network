    "context": "Only a brief overview of the most popular methods is provided here and the reader is referred to these references and to analytical journals for more detailed descriptions. There are a number of advantages of on-site analysis, as the instantaneously available results allow for adjustments in the sampling strategy of an ongoing experiment. These measurements also provide higher time resolution for investigating parameters that control emissions. In situ measurements of isoprene have been accomplished with chemiluminescence detectors (Guenther et al., 1996b, Singsaas and Sharkey, 2000), argon ionization detectors (Sharkey et al., 1996), photoionization detectors (Keller and Lerdau, 1999) and reduction gas detectors (Harley et al., 1996; Geron et al., 2000). PTR-MS is another technique that is increasingly utilized in BVOC research because of its high time resolution and ability to monitor multiple compounds simultaneously (De Gouw et al., 1999; Karl et al., 2001; Tani et al., 2003; Graus et al., 2004; Steeghs et al., 2004). PTR-MS has been useful in demonstrating the time- and light-dependent synthesis and emissions of certain compounds (Graus et al., 2004; Tholl et al., 2006 and references therein). However, there are some challenges with using this technique. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a compound analyzed using various ionization techniques, including argon ionization detectors and photoionization detectors. The relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the methods used for detecting and measuring emissions of this volatile organic compound. However, there is no detailed discussion of how ionization specifically affects the analysis of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene beyond its mention in the context of analytical methods.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and ionization, as they are both part of the discussion on analytical methods for measuring emissions. However, the relationship lacks depth and specific interaction details.",
