    "context": "Also, the leaf orientation can be controlled to be perpendicular to the light source. Leaf cuvettes are generally designed for photosynthesis studies, but with some modifications, they can also be used for BVOC emission measurements. Isoprene is extremely volatile, which reduces the risk of wall losses (see Section 5), and isoprene emission rates from many trees can be 10\u20131000 times greater than those for MT or SQT. The resulting high concentrations and negligible analyte losses typically make leaf cuvettes suitable for studying temperature and light effects on isoprene emissions (Guenther et al., 1991; Harley et al., 1996). The internal surface area of a leaf cuvette is large relative to the amount of biomass that is enclosed. Materials used in commercial systems are generally not designed to be chemically inert towards heavier BVOC, and semi-volatile and reactive compounds are prone to be lost in a leaf cuvette. Synthetic materials used in commercial leaf cuvettes have also been found to create analytical interferences from out-gassing (Harley, P., National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, C.O., Helmig, D., unpublished results).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to the term 'analyte' as it is a type of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that may be measured in studies involving leaf cuvettes designed for photosynthesis and BVOC emission measurements. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the term 'analyte' is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is more on the general properties of BVOCs and the challenges in measuring them rather than on 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene as a specific analyte of interest.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned in the context of BVOC emissions, which could be considered an analyte in studies. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or significance as an analyte.",
