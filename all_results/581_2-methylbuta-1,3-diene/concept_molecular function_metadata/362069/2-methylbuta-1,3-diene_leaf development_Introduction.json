    "context": "Reactive and low-volatility BVOC have also been shown to be susceptible to analytical losses. Because of these analytical challenges in measuring reactive BVOC, there has been only limited success in measuring their fluxes at the canopy scale (Ciccioli et al., 1999). Leaf- and branch-level enclosure experiments provide viable alternatives for obtaining fluxes of reactive and low-volatility compounds when ambient measurements are not possible. Several investigators have measured isoprene emissions at the leaf- and branch-level and have characterized these emissions with respect to leaf development, light environment, canopy position, and temperature history (Harley et al., 1996; Sharkey et al., 1996; Geron et al., 2000; Singsaas and Sharkey, 2000; P\u00e9tron et al., 2001). Isotopic labeling experiments using 13C or deuterium have been performed to finely characterize time-dependent isoprene production and emissions (Tholl et al., 2006; and references therein). Branch-level emissions of compounds other than isoprene (e.g. MT, SQT, oxygenated BVOC) are more difficult to quantify because of the reasons previously discussed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a reactive biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), is indirectly related to leaf development through its emissions, which are influenced by factors such as leaf development stage, light environment, and temperature history. The studies referenced focus on measuring isoprene emissions, which are relevant to the broader category of BVOCs, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, in relation to leaf characteristics. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and leaf development is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are associated with the study of BVOC emissions in relation to leaf development, but there is no direct discussion of how 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene specifically affects or is affected by leaf development.",
