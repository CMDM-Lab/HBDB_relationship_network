    "context": "[9] Global emission totals of anthropogenic pollutants were taken from the IS92a scenario and distributed over the globe according to the IPCC SRES A2 scenario. [1] With the vegetation distribution fixed at that for the 1990s, isoprene emissions were projected to increase from 550 to approximately 740\u00e2\u20ac\u0160Tg\u00e2\u20ac\u0160yr\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 by 2100. [2] However, a smaller increase to 700\u00e2\u20ac\u0160Tg\u00e2\u20ac\u0160yr\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 was simulated when the 2090s vegetation distribution was used. [3] Isoprene emissions were therefore approximately 40\u00e2\u20ac\u0160Tg\u00e2\u20ac\u0160yr\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 lesser if vegetation change was included in the simulations. [1] Effects of climate change and associated vegetation responses on summertime (June, July and August) mean surface ozone levels (ppbv): changes between the 1990s and the 2090s. [2] (a) Vegetation distribution fixed at 1990s state, (b) vegetation fixed at state simulated for 2090s due to climate change in HadCM3LC. [3] A positive value indicates that ozone levels are greater in the 2090s than the 1990s. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to vegetation as its emissions are projected to increase significantly due to changes in vegetation distribution by 2100. The study indicates that isoprene emissions are influenced by the state of vegetation, with a notable reduction in emissions when accounting for future vegetation changes. This highlights the ecological relationship between isoprene emissions and vegetation dynamics under climate change scenarios.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and vegetation, as the context discusses how changes in vegetation distribution directly affect isoprene emissions, supported by quantitative projections.",
        "score": 4
