    "context": "Also, the leaf orientation can be controlled to be perpendicular to the light source. Leaf cuvettes are generally designed for photosynthesis studies, but with some modifications, they can also be used for BVOC emission measurements. Isoprene is extremely volatile, which reduces the risk of wall losses (see Section 5), and isoprene emission rates from many trees can be 10\u20131000 times greater than those for MT or SQT. The resulting high concentrations and negligible analyte losses typically make leaf cuvettes suitable for studying temperature and light effects on isoprene emissions (Guenther et al., 1991; Harley et al., 1996). The internal surface area of a leaf cuvette is large relative to the amount of biomass that is enclosed. Materials used in commercial systems are generally not designed to be chemically inert towards heavier BVOC, and semi-volatile and reactive compounds are prone to be lost in a leaf cuvette. Synthetic materials used in commercial leaf cuvettes have also been found to create analytical interferences from out-gassing (Harley, P., National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, C.O., Helmig, D., unpublished results).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to studies conducted by Harley et al. on BVOC (biogenic volatile organic compound) emissions from leaves. The mention of Harley indicates that the research focuses on the effects of environmental factors on isoprene emissions, highlighting the significance of leaf cuvettes in measuring these emissions. However, the relationship is primarily about the study of isoprene rather than a direct interaction with Harley as a person or entity.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is linked to Harley through research on BVOC emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship beyond the context of the study.",
