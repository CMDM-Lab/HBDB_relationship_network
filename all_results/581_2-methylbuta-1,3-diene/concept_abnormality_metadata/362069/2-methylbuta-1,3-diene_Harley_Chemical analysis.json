    "context": "Only a brief overview of the most popular methods is provided here and the reader is referred to these references and to analytical journals for more detailed descriptions. There are a number of advantages of on-site analysis, as the instantaneously available results allow for adjustments in the sampling strategy of an ongoing experiment. These measurements also provide higher time resolution for investigating parameters that control emissions. In situ measurements of isoprene have been accomplished with chemiluminescence detectors (Guenther et al., 1996b, Singsaas and Sharkey, 2000), argon ionization detectors (Sharkey et al., 1996), photoionization detectors (Keller and Lerdau, 1999) and reduction gas detectors (Harley et al., 1996; Geron et al., 2000). PTR-MS is another technique that is increasingly utilized in BVOC research because of its high time resolution and ability to monitor multiple compounds simultaneously (De Gouw et al., 1999; Karl et al., 2001; Tani et al., 2003; Graus et al., 2004; Steeghs et al., 2004). PTR-MS has been useful in demonstrating the time- and light-dependent synthesis and emissions of certain compounds (Graus et al., 2004; Tholl et al., 2006 and references therein). However, there are some challenges with using this technique. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to various analytical methods for measuring volatile organic compounds, including references to Harley et al. (1996) who contributed to the understanding of isoprene emissions. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Harley is not elaborated upon, as Harley is cited primarily in the context of measurement techniques rather than a direct interaction or significant finding related to isoprene itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are associated with the study of isoprene emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction beyond Harley's contribution to measurement methods.",
