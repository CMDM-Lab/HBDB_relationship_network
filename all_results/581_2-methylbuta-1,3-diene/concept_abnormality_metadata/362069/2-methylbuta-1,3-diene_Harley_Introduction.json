    "context": "Reactive and low-volatility BVOC have also been shown to be susceptible to analytical losses. Because of these analytical challenges in measuring reactive BVOC, there has been only limited success in measuring their fluxes at the canopy scale (Ciccioli et al., 1999). Leaf- and branch-level enclosure experiments provide viable alternatives for obtaining fluxes of reactive and low-volatility compounds when ambient measurements are not possible. Several investigators have measured isoprene emissions at the leaf- and branch-level and have characterized these emissions with respect to leaf development, light environment, canopy position, and temperature history (Harley et al., 1996; Sharkey et al., 1996; Geron et al., 2000; Singsaas and Sharkey, 2000; P\u00e9tron et al., 2001). Isotopic labeling experiments using 13C or deuterium have been performed to finely characterize time-dependent isoprene production and emissions (Tholl et al., 2006; and references therein). Branch-level emissions of compounds other than isoprene (e.g. MT, SQT, oxygenated BVOC) are more difficult to quantify because of the reasons previously discussed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to the research conducted by Harley and others on its emissions from leaves and branches. The studies referenced focus on the characterization of isoprene emissions concerning various environmental factors. However, the relationship is primarily about the measurement and analysis of isoprene rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Harley.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is studied in the context of Harley's research on its emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of a direct relationship or interaction.",
        "score": 2
