    "context": "In the case of C. japonica, the increase in monoterpene emissions with light intensity from 0 to 1000\u03bcmolm\u22122 s\u22121 can be clearly seen for \u03b1-pinene (2.8 times), \u03b2-pinene (2.5 times), myrcene (5.8 times), \u03b1-terpinene (3.6 times), and \u03b3-terpinene (2.8 times); these comprise majority of the monoterpene emitted. In the case of P. densiflora, all major monoterpenes (\u03b1-pinene (14 times), \u03b2-pinene (26 times), myrcene (31 times)) emitted showed dependence on light intensity, though the algorithm by Guenther cannot express the dependency of light intensity. Using the new forest database collected from several prefecture offices including the age, we made a more accurate BVOC emissions potential map. It was found that the emissions of isoprene and of monoterpene were 596 and 54tonh\u22121 in the Kinki region, respectively. Moreover by considering the dependency of temperature and of light intensity and the variation of leaf biomass, diurnal and seasonal variations of BVOC emission potential were estimated. The BVOC emission was 14 times higher in summer than in winter; therefore oxidant concentration can be expected to be high in daytime due to the increase of BVOC emission. Our experiments showed that BVOC emission of all plants we used in this study strongly depended on temperature and light intensity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to monoterpenes as both are classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The study focuses on the emission patterns of various monoterpenes in response to light intensity, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, although not specifically mentioned in the emission data, is part of the broader category of BVOCs that may also be influenced by similar environmental factors. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or roles.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes, as they both belong to the category of BVOCs. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific relevance between the two compounds.",
