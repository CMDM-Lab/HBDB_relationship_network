    "context": "In the case of C. japonica, the increase in monoterpene emissions with light intensity from 0 to 1000\u03bcmolm\u22122 s\u22121 can be clearly seen for \u03b1-pinene (2.8 times), \u03b2-pinene (2.5 times), myrcene (5.8 times), \u03b1-terpinene (3.6 times), and \u03b3-terpinene (2.8 times); these comprise majority of the monoterpene emitted. In the case of P. densiflora, all major monoterpenes (\u03b1-pinene (14 times), \u03b2-pinene (26 times), myrcene (31 times)) emitted showed dependence on light intensity, though the algorithm by Guenther cannot express the dependency of light intensity. Using the new forest database collected from several prefecture offices including the age, we made a more accurate BVOC emissions potential map. It was found that the emissions of isoprene and of monoterpene were 596 and 54tonh\u22121 in the Kinki region, respectively. Moreover by considering the dependency of temperature and of light intensity and the variation of leaf biomass, diurnal and seasonal variations of BVOC emission potential were estimated. The BVOC emission was 14 times higher in summer than in winter; therefore oxidant concentration can be expected to be high in daytime due to the increase of BVOC emission. Our experiments showed that BVOC emission of all plants we used in this study strongly depended on temperature and light intensity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The study discusses the emissions of isoprene alongside various monoterpenes in response to environmental factors like light intensity and temperature. While both compounds are mentioned in the context of BVOC emissions, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are part of the broader category of BVOCs emitted by plants, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon in the context.",
