    "context": "On the other hand, monoterpenes are emitted constantly during night time as well because it is only dependent on temperature and not on light intensity. Fig. 13(b) shows the BVOC emissions potential in February. The amount is less than one tenth of August and the ratio of monoterpene emission to the total BVOC is higher than August due to the weakness of light intensity in winter and isoprene emission is dependent on light intensity. In addition, to estimate the isoprene emission more accurately, leaves in the shade can be taken into account by using LAI (leaf area index).Seasonal variation of BVOC emissions Seasonal variation of BVOC emissions has been measured before (Boissard et al., 2001; Hakola et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2005) and predicted that the amount of BVOC emissions tend to increase in summer. In this study, to estimate the seasonal variation of BVOC emission amount, not only temperature and light intensity but the amount of leaves in each season was taken into account. Fig. 14 shows the seasonal ratio of leaves compared with the maximum value in summer. Deciduous trees shed nearly 30% of their leaves in the winter, which is comparatively less than the deciduous trees that shed all the leaves exponentially by winter time. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The discussion highlights the dependence of isoprene emissions on light intensity, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be related but not explicitly detailed. Both compounds are part of the broader study of seasonal variations in BVOC emissions, indicating a shared category but lacking a direct interaction or comparison.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both BVOCs mentioned in the context of plant emissions. However, their specific relationship is not elaborated upon, leading to a general association rather than a detailed interaction.",
