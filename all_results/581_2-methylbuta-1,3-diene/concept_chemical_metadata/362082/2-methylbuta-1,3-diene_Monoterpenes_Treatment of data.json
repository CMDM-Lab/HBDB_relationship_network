    "context": "E iso (hourly isoprene emission) were estimated by (2) E iso = E F iso \u00d7 C T \u00d7 C L \u00d7 FBD \u00d7 V , where EF iso is the isoprene emission rate at standard conditions (temperature: 303K, PAR: 1000\u03bcmolm\u22122 s\u22121). C T is the correction factor due to temperature and C L is the correction factor due to PAR. FBD is the foliar biomass density (gm\u22122) and V is the seasonal ratio of leaves compared with the maximum value in summer. C T, C L are defined by (3) C T = exp ( C T 1 ( T - T s ) / RT T s ) 1 + exp ( C T 2 ( T - T m ) / R T s T ) , (4) C L = \u03b1 C L 1 L ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) L 2 , where \u03b1 (0.0027), C L1 (1.066), C T1 (95,000Jmol\u22121), C T2 (230,000Jmol\u22121) and T m (314K) are empirical coefficients, L is the PAR flux (\u03bcmolm\u22122 s\u22121), T s is the standard reference temperature (303K), R (8.314JK\u22121 mol\u22121) is the ideal gas constant, and T (K) is the foliar biomass temperature.Monoterpene emission algorithm While isoprene emissions are coupled to the rate of biosynthesis which is dependent upon temperature and PAR, monoterpenes emissions from coniferous plants are mainly reported to increase exponentially with temperature (Tingey et al., 1980; Juuti et al., 1990; Guenther et al., 1991). The primary monoterpenes identified as emission products from the 10 experimental plants are \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, myrcene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b1-terpinene, p-cymene, limonene, \u03b3-terpinene, and terpinolene. E mono (hourly monoterpene emissions) are generally described by the following equation as an exponential function of temperature (5) E mono = E F mono exp ( \u03b2 ( T - T s ) ) FBD \u00d7 V , where EF mono is the standard monoterpene emission factor (\u03bcg g dw - 1 h\u22121) at standard temperature T s=303K. \u03b2 is an empirical coefficient ranging between 0.057 and 0.144K\u22121.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to monoterpenes, as both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants. The emission rates of isoprene are influenced by temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), while monoterpene emissions from coniferous plants are reported to increase exponentially with temperature. This indicates a shared biological process in plant emissions, although the specific mechanisms and conditions for each compound's emission differ.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes are mentioned in the context of plant emissions, indicating a relationship through their shared classification as VOCs. However, the details of their interactions or comparative significance are not deeply explored.",
