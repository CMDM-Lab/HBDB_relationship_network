    "context": "E iso (hourly isoprene emission) were estimated by (2) E iso = E F iso \u00d7 C T \u00d7 C L \u00d7 FBD \u00d7 V , where EF iso is the isoprene emission rate at standard conditions (temperature: 303K, PAR: 1000\u03bcmolm\u22122 s\u22121). C T is the correction factor due to temperature and C L is the correction factor due to PAR. FBD is the foliar biomass density (gm\u22122) and V is the seasonal ratio of leaves compared with the maximum value in summer. C T, C L are defined by (3) C T = exp ( C T 1 ( T - T s ) / RT T s ) 1 + exp ( C T 2 ( T - T m ) / R T s T ) , (4) C L = \u03b1 C L 1 L ( 1 + \u03b1 2 ) L 2 , where \u03b1 (0.0027), C L1 (1.066), C T1 (95,000Jmol\u22121), C T2 (230,000Jmol\u22121) and T m (314K) are empirical coefficients, L is the PAR flux (\u03bcmolm\u22122 s\u22121), T s is the standard reference temperature (303K), R (8.314JK\u22121 mol\u22121) is the ideal gas constant, and T (K) is the foliar biomass temperature.Monoterpene emission algorithm While isoprene emissions are coupled to the rate of biosynthesis which is dependent upon temperature and PAR, monoterpenes emissions from coniferous plants are mainly reported to increase exponentially with temperature (Tingey et al., 1980; Juuti et al., 1990; Guenther et al., 1991). The primary monoterpenes identified as emission products from the 10 experimental plants are \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, myrcene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b1-terpinene, p-cymene, limonene, \u03b3-terpinene, and terpinolene. E mono (hourly monoterpene emissions) are generally described by the following equation as an exponential function of temperature (5) E mono = E F mono exp ( \u03b2 ( T - T s ) ) FBD \u00d7 V , where EF mono is the standard monoterpene emission factor (\u03bcg g dw - 1 h\u22121) at standard temperature T s=303K. \u03b2 is an empirical coefficient ranging between 0.057 and 0.144K\u22121.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in plant emissions. The context discusses isoprene emissions and their dependence on environmental factors, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. Their relationship is primarily based on their chemical similarity and role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in relation to plant emissions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in the context of plant emissions and atmospheric chemistry, indicating a shared significance. However, the specific interactions or differences between them are not elaborated upon in detail.",
