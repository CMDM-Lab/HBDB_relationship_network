    "context": "[6] Policies to avoid deforestation in Amazonia may have greater benefits than previously assumed, through both reducing the vulnerability of wider areas of forests and facilitating easier adaptation to climate change. Nowadays it is recognized that biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are emitted from plants. Several inventories suggested that the amount of BVOC is more than the anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on the global scale (Zimmerman, 1979; Lamb et al., 1987; Muller, 1992; Guenther et al., 1995). Among various species of BVOC, isoprene and monoterpenes are the abundant BVOC (Zimmerman et al., 1978). BVOCs play an important role in atmospheric chemistry because they can photochemically react with NO x and enhance the production of ozone in the troposphere (Fehsenfeld, 1992; Rosselle, 1994; Simpson et al., 1995). Isoprene in BVOC is reported to be more reactive than most anthropogenic VOCs (Stockwell and Kuhn, 1998), because it plays an important role due to the generation of oxidant. In addition, it is reported that the increase in average temperature due to global warming (IPCC, 2001) may cause an increase in BVOC emission, and consequently, the photochemical oxidant concentration can rise when more BVOC reacts photochemically with NO x (Pun et al., 2002; Hanna et al., 2001; Pierce et al., 1998).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned as a significant biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) alongside monoterpenes, which are also abundant BVOCs emitted from plants. Both compounds play crucial roles in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in their reactions with nitrogen oxides (NOx) that contribute to ozone production in the troposphere. While they are both classified as BVOCs, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their shared classification.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes are categorized as BVOCs with similar roles in atmospheric chemistry, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon in the context.",
