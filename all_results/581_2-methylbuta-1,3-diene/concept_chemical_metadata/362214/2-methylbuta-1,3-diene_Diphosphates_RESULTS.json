    "context": "[4] The data are drawn from all experiments and include feedings of three different DOX feedings. [1] We hypothesize that DOX-d2 is converted to DMAPP-d2 inside the chloroplast and that no DMAPP-d2 derived from DOX-d2 occurs in the cytosol. [2] Attempts to feed DMAPP-d2 were unsuccessful, as expected. [3] This confirms that the C5-diphosphates do not cross membranes to reach the chloroplasts in sufficient amounts to be detected by isoprene emission. [4] In addition, we note that one of the xylulose kinases in the Arabidopsis genome is predicted to have a transit sequence. [5] Therefore, all DMAPP-d2 derived from the exogenous precursor should be in the chloroplast, although the cytosol has substantial amounts of DMAPP resulting from the MVA pathway. [6] By measuring the DMAPP-d2 we could relate isoprene-d2 emission to its substrate independent of the cytosolic DMAPP. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to diphosphates through the metabolic pathway involving DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate), a C5-diphosphate. The study discusses the conversion of DOX-d2 to DMAPP-d2 in chloroplasts, indicating that diphosphates are precursors in the biosynthesis of isoprene. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, focusing more on the metabolic processes rather than a direct interaction between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in metabolic pathways, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
