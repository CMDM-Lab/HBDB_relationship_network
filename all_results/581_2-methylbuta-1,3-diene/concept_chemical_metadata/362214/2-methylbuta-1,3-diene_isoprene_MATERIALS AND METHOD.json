[3] The supernatant was injected into a glass vial already filled with sulfuric acid (8 m), flushed with gaseous nitrogen, and sealed. [4] After incubating for 45 min in a water bath at 50\u00c2\u00b0C, the assay vial was flushed again with nitrogen and the headspace gas passed through a cooling trap at \u00e2\u02c6\u201990\u00c2\u00b0C before entering the photoacoustic spectrometer in order to determine isoprene-d2 concentration. [5] This method converts 5% of the DMAPP to isoprene as determined by , and this correction was used to calculate the DMAPP-d2 from the isorpene-d2 measurement.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as isoprene is a product derived from the conversion of DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate), which is a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of terpenes. The mention of isoprene in relation to biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) indicates its significance in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the context of forest emissions. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both terms are connected through the biochemical pathway of isoprene synthesis from DMAPP, but the context does not provide extensive details on their direct interaction or significance beyond this connection.",
