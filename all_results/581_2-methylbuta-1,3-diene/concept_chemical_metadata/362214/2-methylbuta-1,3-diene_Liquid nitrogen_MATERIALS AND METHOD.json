    "context": "[5] The data were analyzed by a least squares fit described by , and the error bars on the photoacoustic data give the uncertainty of the fit. [6] All measurements were made at 30\u00c2\u00b0C (except for heatfleck measurements) and 1,000 \u00ce\u00bcmol m\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 s\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 light. [7] After turning on light, basal isoprene emission rate was determined before adding exogenous DOX-d2. [8] After isoprene-d2 reached its constant level, leaves were removed from the chamber and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in liquid nitrogen (covered by aluminum foil) until they were used for DMAPP assays. [1] For determining the DMAPP amount, we used the method of ; briefly, leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and afterward distilled water was added. [2] The samples were then centrifuged in a microfuge for 15 min at 4\u00c2\u00b0C. [3] The supernatant was injected into a glass vial already filled with sulfuric acid (8 m), flushed with gaseous nitrogen, and sealed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is studied in relation to its emission rates from leaves, which are subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen for preservation before further analysis. Liquid nitrogen is used to quickly freeze the leaf samples, ensuring that the biochemical properties of isoprene are maintained for accurate DMAPP assays. However, there is no direct chemical interaction or functional relationship discussed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and liquid nitrogen beyond this preservation method.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the same experimental procedure, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction beyond the use of liquid nitrogen for sample preservation.",
