    "context": "[1] For determining the DMAPP amount, we used the method of ; briefly, leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen and afterward distilled water was added. [2] The samples were then centrifuged in a microfuge for 15 min at 4\u00c2\u00b0C. [3] The supernatant was injected into a glass vial already filled with sulfuric acid (8 m), flushed with gaseous nitrogen, and sealed. [4] After incubating for 45 min in a water bath at 50\u00c2\u00b0C, the assay vial was flushed again with nitrogen and the headspace gas passed through a cooling trap at \u00e2\u02c6\u201990\u00c2\u00b0C before entering the photoacoustic spectrometer in order to determine isoprene-d2 concentration. [5] This method converts 5% of the DMAPP to isoprene as determined by , and this correction was used to calculate the DMAPP-d2 from the isorpene-d2 measurement.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is indirectly related to nitrogen through the experimental method involving nitrogen flushing during the preparation of samples. Nitrogen is used to create an inert atmosphere in the assay vial filled with sulfuric acid, which is essential for the accurate measurement of isoprene concentration. However, there is no direct chemical or biological interaction discussed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and nitrogen.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the same experimental procedure, but their relationship lacks detailed discussion or significant interaction beyond the context of sample preparation.",
