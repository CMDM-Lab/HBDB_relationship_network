    "context": "[2] The nonphosphorylated, free deoxyxylulose obtained according to Jux and Boland (1999) can be fed to leaves and is rapidly incorporated into the products of the MEP pathway (; ; ). [3] Isoprene derived from dideuterated deoxyxylulose (DOX-d2) can be detected and differentiated from unlabeled isoprene originating from endogenous sources by laser photoacoustics (; ). [4] We used this technique to study the biochemical regulation of isoprene emission . [5] We found that feeding DOX stimulated the rate of isoprene emission only when leaves became starved for carbon. [6] We also found that a large and variable proportion of the total DMAPP in leaves is located outside the chloroplast and is, thus, not available for isoprene emission. [1] DOX-d2 was used to investigate properties of isoprene synthase, especially the affinity of isoprene synthase for its substrate DMAPP. [2] In addition, we studied the regulation of the MEP pathway and its ability to supply a regulated amount of DMAPP for isoprene synthesis during and after heatflecks. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves, which is influenced by carbon availability. The study indicates that the rate of isoprene emission increases when leaves are carbon-starved, suggesting a direct relationship between carbon levels and isoprene production through the MEP pathway. However, the specific biochemical mechanisms linking 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon are not elaborated in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon is established through the context of isoprene emission regulation based on carbon availability, indicating some interaction but lacking detailed mechanistic insights.",
