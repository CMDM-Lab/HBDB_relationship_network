    "context": "[2] This is an indirect measure that may have more uncertainty than in vitro measurements, but this estimate is important because it reflects the enzyme kinetics in situ. [3] We did not measure the Km directly in this work, but our estimated in vivo Km corresponds very well with the high in vitro estimates of the Km of isoprene synthase (; ; ; ; ). [4] Related monoterpene synthases have Kms for their substrate, geranyl diphosphate, between 10 and 100 \u00ce\u00bcm  and sometimes as low as 2.6 \u00ce\u00bcm . [5] The results presented here show that in situ the Km for the allylic diphosphate substrate is much higher for isoprene synthase than for the related monoterpene synthases. [1] Using DOX-d2 we were able to examine the regulation of the early steps of the isoprene biosynthetic pathway. [2] When 2.9 (e.g. [3] Fig. 1) or 7.5 mm (data not shown) DOX-d2 was fed, the exogenous DXP displaced the endogenous supply, but the overall rate of isoprene emission remained constant and presumably so did the concentrations of DMAPP and DXP in the plastid.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to enzyme kinetics, particularly isoprene synthase, which utilizes diphosphate substrates like geranyl diphosphate. The Km values for these substrates indicate their affinity for the enzyme, suggesting a biochemical relationship where diphosphates are crucial for the synthesis of isoprene. However, the specific interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and diphosphates is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is directly linked to diphosphates through the enzymatic process of isoprene synthesis, but the context does not provide extensive details on their interaction beyond substrate affinity.",
