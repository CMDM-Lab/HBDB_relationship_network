    "context": "[4] Measurements were done between July and September 2003. [1] Gas exchange measurements were carried out as described in  but using a leaf chamber with temperature control plus a fan to reduce the boundary layer resistance to heat transfer. [2] We found that that Eucalyptus emits isoprene in the ppmv level, dominating the spectral absorption of the photoacoustic spectrometer. [3] Given the selectivity and sensitivity of the photoacoustic spectrometer for isoprene and isoprene-d2, other monoterpene emissions of Eucalyptus leaves can be neglected. [4] Isoprene, isoprene-d2, and CO2 levels were continuously determined with a 12CO2-laser-photoacoustic spectrometer. [5] The data were analyzed by a least squares fit described by , and the error bars on the photoacoustic data give the uncertainty of the fit. [6] All measurements were made at 30\u00c2\u00b0C (except for heatfleck measurements) and 1,000 \u00ce\u00bcmol m\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 s\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 light. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is mentioned as a significant emission from Eucalyptus leaves. Monoterpenes are a broader class of compounds that includes isoprene. While the study focuses on isoprene emissions, it implies a relationship with monoterpenes as part of the overall volatile organic compound emissions from the plant, although specific interactions or comparisons are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes, as both are related to plant emissions. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific functional relationships between them.",
