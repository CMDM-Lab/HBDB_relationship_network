    "context": "[8] Draining pools of intermediates at temperatures above 35\u00c2\u00b0C may account for the reduction in isoprene emission seen when leaves are above 35\u00c2\u00b0C for more than 15 min . [1] The hypothesized regulation of the MEP pathway in response to the various treatments is summarized in Table I. [2] Assuming a high gain feedback loop, we make the following interpretations. [3] When 2.94 mm DOX-d2 is fed to leaves, the rate of arrival and conversion to DXP is less than the rate of use of DXP, and DXS is perfectly regulated to compensate for the exogenous carbon source, keeping the DXP and DMAPP concentrations constant (and, therefore, isoprene emission rate stays constant). [4] When 36.25 mm DOX is fed, the exogenous source exceeds the steady-state consumption, and so even with essentially no endogenous production of DXP, the DMAPP concentration increases, resulting in an increase in the rate of isoprene emission. [5] This could only occur if the steady-state rate of DMAPP was not substantially above the Km of isoprene synthase for DMAPP. [6] From the discussion above, we believe that the very high Kms (in the millimolar range) reported for the isolated enzyme also are true for the enzyme in situ, making it possible for exogenous DOX to increase the rate of isoprene emission by increasing the concentration of DMAPP.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves, which is influenced by the availability of carbon sources, particularly through the MEP pathway. The regulation of isoprene emission is linked to the concentration of DMAPP, a carbon-containing intermediate, suggesting that carbon availability directly impacts isoprene production. However, the relationship is more about the role of carbon in the metabolic pathway rather than a direct interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses how carbon sources affect the production of isoprene, indicating a connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon in metabolic processes, but without a detailed interaction.",
