    "context": "[10] The results confirm that isoprene synthase has a Km 10- to 100-fold higher for its allylic diphosphate substrate than related monoterpene synthases for geranyl diphosphate. [1] Isoprene is emitted from many plants, including mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (; ). [2] Isoprene emission from plants is one of the most important sources of volatile organic compounds released to the atmosphere (; , ; ). [3] Isoprene emission has been hypothesized to provide leaves protection from heat damage , especially during short heatflecks , and to protect against ozone and other active oxygen species (; ; ). [4] Isoprene is made in chloroplasts from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by isoprene synthase (, ; ), an enzyme related to monoterpene synthases . [5] Monoterpene synthases have a high affinity for their substrate, geranyl diphosphate (Km in the micromolar range), but isoprene synthases examined to date have a much lower affinity (Kms in the millimolar range; ; ). [1] Isoprene is made mostly from carbon previously fixed by photosynthesis (; ; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from plants and its protective role against ozone and other reactive oxygen species. Isoprene is hypothesized to help plants mitigate heat damage and oxidative stress caused by ozone exposure, indicating a significant interaction between the two compounds in the context of plant physiology and environmental stress responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between isoprene and ozone, as isoprene is suggested to provide protective benefits against ozone-induced damage in plants. This relationship is supported by the context discussing the physiological role of isoprene in response to environmental stressors.",
        "score": 4
