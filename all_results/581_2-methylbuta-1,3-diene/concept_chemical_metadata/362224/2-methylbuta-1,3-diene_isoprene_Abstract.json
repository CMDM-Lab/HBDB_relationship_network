    "context": "[2] TOHLM was deployed a month after PROPHET 2000, from 15 August to 14 September 2000, in the Texas Air Quality Study (TexAQS 2000). [3] The site was located in the urban plume of Houston, Texas. [4] The instrument configuration and operation was identical to that in PROPHET 2000. [5] In this environment, the calculated OH reactivity had contributions from anthropogenic VOCs (35%); CO, NO2, SO2, and HCHO (55%); and isoprene (<6%). [6] The average difference between the measured and calculated OH reactivities during the TexAQS is 0.36 \u00c2\u00b1 1.65 s\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1 for a mean OH reactivity of 9.4 s\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1, independent of temperature, from 295 K to 313 K. [7] This temperature-independent agreement in an environment dominated by anthropogenic emissions provides additional evidence that the OH missing reactivity observed during PROPHET 2000 is a result of unmeasured temperature-dependent BVOCs. [1] OH reactivity measurements have been analyzed for only a few locations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to the overall OH reactivity in the atmosphere. While isoprene is specifically noted to have a minor contribution (<6%) to the OH reactivity, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be related as a similar compound, but their direct relationship or interaction is not explicitly discussed. They are part of the broader category of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) relevant to atmospheric chemistry.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as both are categorized as VOCs contributing to OH reactivity. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships in the context provided.",
