    "context": "[3] The sum of the reaction frequencies with OH for all chemicals is called the OH reactivity, which is the inverse of the OH lifetime. [4] The calculated OH reactivity for the BVOCs that are emitted annually in North America has contributions from isoprene (51%), terpenes (31%), oxygenated BVOCs such as alcohols (16%), and all other known BVOCs (2%) . [5] Oxidation of BVOCs by OH in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) is the principal source of tropospheric O3 . [6] At the same time, O3 reacts with olefinic BVOCs, such as isoprene and terpenes, to produce OH (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c). [7] Oxidation of some BVOCs by OH, O3, and NO3 produces organic acids that have low vapor pressures and thus condense to form secondary organic aerosols (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c). [8] Understanding the OH reactivity is key to assessing the importance of these biogenic emissions to O3 and aerosol formation. [1] Recent indirect evidence indicates that forests emit unknown, reactive BVOCs, perhaps terpenes . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is identified as a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that contributes to the overall reactivity of alkenes in atmospheric chemistry. Alkenes, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, are involved in reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozone (O3), which are significant for understanding ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol production. The mention of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene within the broader category of alkenes highlights its role in atmospheric reactions, although the specific interactions are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is categorized as an alkene and is discussed in the context of its reactivity and role in atmospheric chemistry. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of specific interactions.",
