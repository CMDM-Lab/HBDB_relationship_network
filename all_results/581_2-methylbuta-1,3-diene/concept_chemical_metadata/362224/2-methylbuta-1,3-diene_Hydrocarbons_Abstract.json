    "context": "[7] The detection technique is low-pressure laser-induced fluorescence . [8] OH reacts with trace constituents in the airflow, and as the movable tube is drawn further away from the detector, the observed OH signal decreases. [9] The OH reactivity (s\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1) is determined from the slope of the logarithm of the OH signal, as a function of the distance between the OH injector and detector divided by the velocity of the air . [1] The PROPHET 2000 intensive campaign also included meteorological and chemical measurements: temperature, pressure, wind direction and speed, relative humidity, photolysis frequencies, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), isoprene, OH, HO2, NO, various nitrates, and anthropogenic hydrocarbons. [2] Missing in 2000 were measurements of BVOCs, such as acetaldehyde, acetone, prominent monoterpenes, formaldehyde (HCHO), methyl vinyl ketone (MVK), methacrolein (MACR), ethanol, and methanol. [3] However, these were measured in summer 1998 . [4] The PROPHET 1998 campaign was conducted at the same tower and during a roughly similar period: 11 July to 20 August. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a trace constituent among various hydrocarbons measured during the PROPHET campaigns. While it is categorized as a hydrocarbon, the context does not provide specific interactions or detailed relationships between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and other hydrocarbons. The mention is primarily in the context of atmospheric measurements rather than a direct functional or chemical relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is classified under hydrocarbons, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or significance in the context provided.",
