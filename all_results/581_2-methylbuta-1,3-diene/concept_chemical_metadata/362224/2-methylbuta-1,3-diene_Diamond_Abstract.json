    "context": "[1] (A) The total OH reactivity measurements (open circles) are shown with the OH reactivity we calculated from the sum of individual chemicals' reaction frequencies (solid squares). [2] Calculated and measured OH reactivity increase with temperature, as expected, because they are both dominated by isoprene emissions, which increase with temperature over this temperature range. [3] Error bars for measurements and calculations are the combination of the total uncertainty in the measurements or calculations and the SEM. [4] (B) The calculated OH reactivity (solid black squares) consists of contributions from OH reactions with isoprene (open orange squares), CO and NO2 (green diamonds), HCHO (black plus symbols), acetaldehyde (magenta circles), anthropogenic VOCs (red triangles), and terpenes (blue crosses). [5] The data are smoothed with a running mean over 5 K, which smoothes the curves without changing the statistics of the missing OH reactivity. [1] We used the chemical species reported in Table 1 to calculate the OH reactivity for PROPHET (Fig. 1B). [2] Isoprene provides the largest contribution (49%), with contributions from CO and NO2 (21%), HCHO and acetaldehyde (12% each), anthropogenic VOCs (3%), monoterpenes (2%), and O3, HO2, SO2, and NO (<1% combined).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its contributions to OH reactivity, which is influenced by temperature and emissions. However, there is no mention of 'Diamond' in a chemical or functional context related to isoprene or OH reactivity. The two terms appear unrelated within the provided information.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Diamond are mentioned in the same context but without any direct or indirect relationship discussed. They appear coincidentally without relevance to each other.",
