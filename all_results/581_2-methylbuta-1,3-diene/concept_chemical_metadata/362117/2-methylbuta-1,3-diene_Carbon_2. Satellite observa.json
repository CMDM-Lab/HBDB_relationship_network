[2] The MEGAN isoprene emission dependence on surface air temperature  explained 75% of the month-to-month variability in GOME-derived isoprene emissions over the southeast USA during May\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSeptember 1996\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2001. [3] used the MCM to parametrize the time-dependent HCHO yield from the oxidation of alpha- and beta-pinenes for use in GEOS-Chem. [4] Alpha- and beta-pinenes have atmospheric lifetimes of a few hours against OH and O3, with initial products including HCHO (with a smaller per carbon yield than isoprene), other aldehydes and acetone. [5] Long-lived intermediates such as acetone delay HCHO production, leading to a diffuse contribution to observed HCHO columns comparable to the slant column fitting uncertainty .

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions and atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the context of carbon compounds. Isoprene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to atmospheric carbon dynamics through its oxidation processes, leading to the formation of carbon-containing products like formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetone. However, the relationship is primarily indirect, as carbon is a broader category encompassing various compounds, including isoprene, without a specific focus on their direct interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon, as they are both involved in atmospheric chemistry. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific functional relationships between them, indicating a general association rather than a significant or direct link.",
