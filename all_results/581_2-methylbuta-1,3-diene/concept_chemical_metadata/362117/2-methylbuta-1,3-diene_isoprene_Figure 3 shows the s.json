    "context": "[3] showed that standard canopy emission models could not explain this seasonal cycle, even with increases in ambient levels of surface temperature and PAR during the dry season; a similar conclusion was reached for biogenic emission studies over central Africa . [4] They used monthly rainfall rates to define three seasons to help explain the seasonal cycle in isoprene concentrations: wet, transition and dry seasons. [5] The dry season, spanning August\u00e2\u20ac\u201cDecember, shows the lowest level of precipitation; the wet season typically spans January\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMay; and the transition season occurs during June and July, characterized by irregular rains with lower frequency and intensity than during the wet season. [6] This study concluded that leaf-level isoprene emission rates had increased from the wet to dry season, related to water availability, in accordance with branch enclosure measurements from another site ; as noted by , it is also possible that these changes in emission rates are also partly due to phenological variation.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned in relation to biogenic emissions, particularly in the study of seasonal variations in isoprene concentrations. While the context discusses isoprene emissions and their seasonal patterns, it does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, indicating that they are part of a broader discussion on volatile organic compounds emitted from vegetation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are related to biogenic emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions in the context provided.",
