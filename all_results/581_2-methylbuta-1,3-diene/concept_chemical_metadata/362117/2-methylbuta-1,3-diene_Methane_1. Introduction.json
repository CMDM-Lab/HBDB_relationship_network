    "context": "[6] The agreement between the observed annual cycles of GOME HCHO columns and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer firecount data over the Amazon basin (correlations typically greater than 0.75 for a particular year) illustrates the potential of HCHO column to provide quantitative information about biomass burning emissions. [1] The terrestrial biosphere emits a wide range of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs; ). [2] Biogenic VOCs emitted by the terrestrial biosphere have important implications for tropospheric O3 , formation of organic aerosol (e.g. ) and climate change . [3] Isoprene is the dominant non-methane VOC with an estimated global annual emission of 440\u00e2\u20ac\u201c660\u00e2\u20ac\u0160Tg\u00e2\u20ac\u0160C . [1] Bottom-up emission models, which describe the magnitude and variability of biogenic VOC fluxes (e.g. ), are derived largely from sparse in situ measurements, representative of less than 1\u00e2\u20ac\u0160km, and are at least a factor of 2 uncertain on regional and global scales . [2] Temporal variability in these models is driven by a series of empirical relationships relating biogenic emissions to weather and climate (e.g. [3] surface temperature and photosynthetic active radiation; PAR).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and methane are both mentioned as components of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the terrestrial biosphere. However, the context primarily focuses on the emissions of isoprene as the dominant non-methane VOC and does not provide specific details on the relationship or interactions between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and methane. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized under biogenic VOCs, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or significance in the context provided.",
