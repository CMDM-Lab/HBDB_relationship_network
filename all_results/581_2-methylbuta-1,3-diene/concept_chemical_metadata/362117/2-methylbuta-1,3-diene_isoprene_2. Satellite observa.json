[2] The MEGAN isoprene emission dependence on surface air temperature  explained 75% of the month-to-month variability in GOME-derived isoprene emissions over the southeast USA during May\u00e2\u20ac\u201cSeptember 1996\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2001. [3] used the MCM to parametrize the time-dependent HCHO yield from the oxidation of alpha- and beta-pinenes for use in GEOS-Chem. [4] Alpha- and beta-pinenes have atmospheric lifetimes of a few hours against OH and O3, with initial products including HCHO (with a smaller per carbon yield than isoprene), other aldehydes and acetone. [5] Long-lived intermediates such as acetone delay HCHO production, leading to a diffuse contribution to observed HCHO columns comparable to the slant column fitting uncertainty .

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to atmospheric chemistry. While isoprene is specifically discussed in relation to its emissions and seasonal variations, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied as a related compound in the context of VOC emissions. However, there is no direct interaction or detailed relationship established between the two compounds in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs and are relevant to atmospheric studies, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon in the context.",
