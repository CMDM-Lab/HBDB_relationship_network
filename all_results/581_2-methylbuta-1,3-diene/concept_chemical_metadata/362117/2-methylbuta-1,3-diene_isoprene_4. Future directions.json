    "context": "[4] These advances in resolution improve the probability of cloud-free scenes and consequently lead to a greater number of useful data points; provide a better opportunity to spatially disaggregate different sources of HCHO, e.g. [5] biomass burning and biogenic emissions; and potentially can provide a more detailed description of land-surface processes. [6] However, care must be taken when relating observed HCHO columns to parent VOC emissions. [7] For example, isoprene takes approximately an hour to produce (1\u00e2\u02c6\u20191/e) of the ultimate HCHO yield, corresponding to a smearing length-scale of 100\u00e2\u20ac\u0160km . [8] Without resorting to more complicated inverse model techniques, 100\u00e2\u20ac\u0160km may represent the finest resolution that is useful for estimating VOC emissions. [9] Even at this spatial scale, a top-down VOC emission inventory would significantly reduce uncertainties in chemistry\u00e2\u20ac\u201cclimate calculations.  [1] More volatile organic carbon is lost from plants as isoprene than any other molecule. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are directly related as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. The text discusses isoprene's role as a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from plants, highlighting its significance in atmospheric chemistry and its contribution to formaldehyde (HCHO) production. The relationship is underscored by isoprene's prominence as a VOC, which is relevant to the study of emissions and environmental processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are isomers and both are discussed in the context of VOC emissions and their environmental impact. The context provides a clear link between their chemical nature and relevance in atmospheric studies.",
