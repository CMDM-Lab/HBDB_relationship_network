    "context": "[5] Current bottom-up models estimate that 75% of biogenic VOCs are emitted from tropical ecosystems . [1] Detailed in situ biogenic VOC data for tropical ecosystems (e.g. ; ; ; ) are invaluable for testing models and evaluating satellite data, but are sparse in time and space. [2] Satellite observations provide information on scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres and therefore represent the ideal tool for extrapolating in situ data to continental scales. [1] We have shown previously that column measurements of HCHO, a high-yield oxidation product of VOCs, from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) can be used to quantify net fluxes of VOCs, specifically isoprene over North America during summertime, on spatial scales of hundreds of kilometres . [2] The atmospheric abundance of HCHO is determined by a balance between production from the oxidation of VOCs and losses from oxidation by the hydroxyl radical and photolysis. [3] Oxidation of CH4 provides a global background of HCHO. [4] In continental boundary layers, oxidation of short-lived VOCs dominates over the source from CH4, resulting in a major enhancement of the total HCHO column. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from tropical ecosystems. The text discusses the importance of measuring these compounds for understanding their atmospheric impact, particularly in relation to the oxidation processes that produce formaldehyde (HCHO). While both compounds are mentioned in the context of VOC emissions, their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both categorized as biogenic VOCs relevant to atmospheric studies. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or roles within the context provided.",
