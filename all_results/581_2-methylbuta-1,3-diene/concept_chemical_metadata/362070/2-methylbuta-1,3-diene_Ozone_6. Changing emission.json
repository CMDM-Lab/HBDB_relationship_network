    "context": "[4] For this study, the vegetation changes were calculated using the prescribed levels of CO2. [5] The direct effect of CO2 on isoprene was not included . [6] There was no direct feedback between climate and changes in carbon uptake or loss by the vegetation, but the vegetation can change dynamically in response to the changes in climate. [7] Isoprene emissions and surface ozone levels were simulated for the 1990s and 2090s. [8] Two simulations were performed for the 2090s, one with 1990s vegetation and the other with 2090s vegetation including Amazon forest dieback, so the impact of changed vegetation on projected future ozone levels could be assessed. [9] Global emission totals of anthropogenic pollutants were taken from the IS92a scenario and distributed over the globe according to the IPCC SRES A2 scenario. [1] With the vegetation distribution fixed at that for the 1990s, isoprene emissions were projected to increase from 550 to approximately 740\u00e2\u20ac\u0160Tg\u00e2\u20ac\u0160yr\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 by 2100.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions and their impact on surface ozone levels. The study simulates isoprene emissions and ozone levels for different time periods, indicating that changes in vegetation and isoprene emissions can influence future ozone concentrations. However, the specific chemical interactions between isoprene and ozone are not detailed, focusing instead on broader environmental impacts.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the relationship between isoprene emissions and ozone levels, indicating a connection in environmental studies. However, the lack of detailed chemical interaction limits the strength of their relationship.",
