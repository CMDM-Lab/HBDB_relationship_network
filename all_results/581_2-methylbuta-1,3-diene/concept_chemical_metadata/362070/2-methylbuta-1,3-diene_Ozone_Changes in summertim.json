    "context": "[5] Reduced stomatal opening due to higher CO2 led to a reduced flux of ozone into the stomatal cavities within leaves. [6] For these particular simulations, the increase in deposition fluxes caused by larger surface ozone values has been at least partly offset by reduced stomatal conductance. [1] Isoprene emissions have a significant impact on the projected future surface ozone levels. [2] Ignoring vegetation changes has meant that future simulated ozone levels were greater by 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 ppbv, owing to larger isoprene emissions. [3] This may have implications for air quality in the region, with potential implications for the health of humans, animals, ecosystems and crops. [4] Although tropospheric ozone is a GHG, so a relative reduction in ozone due to Amazon forest dieback would provide a negative feedback on radiatively forced climate change, the changes simulated here as a consequence of Amazon forest degradation would exert only a minor radiative forcing so that they are likely to provide only a small feedback on climate change. [5] However, this feedback effect could be larger if the ozone changes affected carbon uptake by vegetation with consequent effects on atmospheric CO2 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions and their impact on surface ozone levels. The text indicates that isoprene emissions significantly influence projected future ozone concentrations, suggesting a direct relationship where increased isoprene leads to higher ozone levels. This interaction highlights the role of vegetation in modulating air quality and ozone dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between isoprene emissions and ozone levels, supported by evidence of how vegetation changes can affect atmospheric conditions. The context indicates that isoprene emissions are crucial in determining future ozone concentrations, demonstrating a clear and impactful relationship.",
