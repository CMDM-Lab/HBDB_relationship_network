    "context": "[2] Accurate evaluation of NOx emissions on the basis of their potential to form ozone should require only measurements or modeling of the few plume species shown in Fig. 4, namely NOx, HNO3, NOy, and ozone itself. [3] In many areas throughout the eastern United States, ambient VOC reactivity is determined by biogenic isoprene . [4] Thus, measurements or models need not rely on extensive characterization of all possible VOCs to adequately simulate ozone formation in these plumes. [5] Regional models using existing and verifiable EPA emissions inventories for power plant NOx and biogenic isoprene should be able to simulate plume ozone formation to the extent that they accurately disperse the NOx emissions of large point sources .

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (also known as isoprene) is identified as a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the formation of ozone. The text discusses how regional models can simulate ozone formation based on emissions of NOx and biogenic isoprene, indicating a direct relationship where isoprene contributes to ozone production in the atmosphere. This highlights the importance of understanding the reactivity of VOCs like isoprene in relation to ozone formation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and ozone, as the context discusses how isoprene influences ozone formation through atmospheric chemistry. The relationship is supported by the mention of modeling and emissions inventories, indicating a clear interaction in environmental science.",
