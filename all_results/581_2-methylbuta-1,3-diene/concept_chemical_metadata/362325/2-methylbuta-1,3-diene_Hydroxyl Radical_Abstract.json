    "context": "[4] Further, these observations can be used to estimate the effect of power plant location and surrounding land use on plume ozone formation processes. [5] We now present two examples showing the influence of biogenic isoprene concentration. [1] Ozone yield data from a flight on 7 July 1999, downwind of the Thomas Hill, Missouri, coal-fired plant, are shown in Fig. 3C. [2] On this day the plume (blue box in Fig. 1B) was remote from isoprene sources, resulting in average measured isoprene concentrations of 0.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.2 ppbv; these concentrations are lower than those observed on the 12 July flight by a factor of 3. Thus, ambient VOC reactivity was sufficiently low that background levels of carbon monoxide and methane contributed substantially to hydroxyl radical (OH) loss rates . [3] Supporting onboard measurements of solar actinic flux, radical precursor concentrations, boundary layer height, and wind speed suggest that the Thomas Hill plume should exhibit ozone formation rates and yields intermediate between the Cumberland and Johnsonville plumes as a result of NOxconcentration differences alone. [4] The relatively low VOC reactivity characteristic of the region resulted in delayed net ozone production and the lower observed yield of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc2 ozone molecules per NOx emitted from the Thomas Hill plant (Fig. 3C). [1] A second illustration of the dependence of ozone production processes on the ambient concentration of isoprene is afforded by consideration of the partitioning of the oxidized nitrogen products in these plumes.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to its ambient concentrations affecting ozone formation processes. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are critical in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene. The text indicates that lower isoprene concentrations lead to reduced reactivity and subsequently influence hydroxyl radical loss rates, suggesting a connection between isoprene levels and hydroxyl radical dynamics in the atmosphere.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between isoprene and hydroxyl radicals is discussed in terms of their roles in atmospheric chemistry and ozone formation, but the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored.",
