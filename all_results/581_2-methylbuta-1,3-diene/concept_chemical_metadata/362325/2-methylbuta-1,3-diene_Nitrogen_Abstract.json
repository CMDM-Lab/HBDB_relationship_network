    "context": "[2] On this day the plume (blue box in Fig. 1B) was remote from isoprene sources, resulting in average measured isoprene concentrations of 0.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.2 ppbv; these concentrations are lower than those observed on the 12 July flight by a factor of 3. Thus, ambient VOC reactivity was sufficiently low that background levels of carbon monoxide and methane contributed substantially to hydroxyl radical (OH) loss rates . [3] Supporting onboard measurements of solar actinic flux, radical precursor concentrations, boundary layer height, and wind speed suggest that the Thomas Hill plume should exhibit ozone formation rates and yields intermediate between the Cumberland and Johnsonville plumes as a result of NOxconcentration differences alone. [4] The relatively low VOC reactivity characteristic of the region resulted in delayed net ozone production and the lower observed yield of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc2 ozone molecules per NOx emitted from the Thomas Hill plant (Fig. 3C). [1] A second illustration of the dependence of ozone production processes on the ambient concentration of isoprene is afforded by consideration of the partitioning of the oxidized nitrogen products in these plumes. [2] The major products of atmospheric NOx oxidation are HNO3 and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and other organic nitrates . [3] High ambient VOC concentrations lead to ozone formation initiated by the peroxy radical (RO2) + NO reaction in the cycle catalyzed by NOx (Fig. 1A). [4] Low ambient VOC concentrations increase the relative importance of the OH + NO2 reaction, thereby favoring HNO3 formation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and nitrogen are indirectly related through their roles in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in ozone formation processes. The text discusses how ambient concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) influence ozone production rates, which can be affected by the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and nitrogen.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in atmospheric reactions affecting ozone formation, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or significant in the context provided.",
