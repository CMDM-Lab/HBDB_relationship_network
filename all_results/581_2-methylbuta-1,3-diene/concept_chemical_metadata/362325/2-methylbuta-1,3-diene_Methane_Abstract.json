    "context": "[4] Further, these observations can be used to estimate the effect of power plant location and surrounding land use on plume ozone formation processes. [5] We now present two examples showing the influence of biogenic isoprene concentration. [1] Ozone yield data from a flight on 7 July 1999, downwind of the Thomas Hill, Missouri, coal-fired plant, are shown in Fig. 3C. [2] On this day the plume (blue box in Fig. 1B) was remote from isoprene sources, resulting in average measured isoprene concentrations of 0.3 \u00c2\u00b1 0.2 ppbv; these concentrations are lower than those observed on the 12 July flight by a factor of 3. Thus, ambient VOC reactivity was sufficiently low that background levels of carbon monoxide and methane contributed substantially to hydroxyl radical (OH) loss rates . [3] Supporting onboard measurements of solar actinic flux, radical precursor concentrations, boundary layer height, and wind speed suggest that the Thomas Hill plume should exhibit ozone formation rates and yields intermediate between the Cumberland and Johnsonville plumes as a result of NOxconcentration differences alone. [4] The relatively low VOC reactivity characteristic of the region resulted in delayed net ozone production and the lower observed yield of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc2 ozone molecules per NOx emitted from the Thomas Hill plant (Fig. 3C). [1] A second illustration of the dependence of ozone production processes on the ambient concentration of isoprene is afforded by consideration of the partitioning of the oxidized nitrogen products in these plumes.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and methane are both mentioned as components influencing ozone formation processes in the atmosphere. However, their relationship is not directly discussed; rather, they are referenced in the context of ambient volatile organic compound (VOC) reactivity and its impact on hydroxyl radical loss rates. The focus is more on their collective influence on ozone production rather than a specific interaction between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and methane, as both are mentioned in relation to ozone formation processes. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships within the context.",
