    "context": "Among these compounds butanethioic acid S-methyl ester was absent in normal feces and was only detected in the feces of the CKD rats. Also striking was the difference in relative abundance of ethanethioic acid S methyl ester released from the cultured feces of the CKD rats (267ppbv) and control (12ppbv) rats (Table\u00a03).Exhaled breath data More than 50 volatile organic compounds were detected in the animals' exhaled breath. Table\u00a04 summarizes the levels of the detected compounds in the exhaled breath of the control and CKD animals. Among the compounds detected in exhaled breath, the relative abundance of four gases including isoprene and three aldehydes i.e. pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal were significantly different (P<0.05) between the CKD and the control groups. The exhaled breath isoprene level was about 2.5 times higher in the CKD animals compared to that found in the control group averaging 380pptv in the CKD rats vs. 150pptv in the control group. In contrast exhaled breath pentanal, hexanal and heptanal levels were significantly lower in the CKD than in the control rats. Specifically, the exhaled breath in CKD animals contained nearly half the amount of these aldehydes than those found in the control group. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not directly mentioned, but aldehydes such as pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal are discussed in relation to their levels in the exhaled breath of control and chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats. The study highlights significant differences in the abundance of these aldehydes between the two groups, suggesting a potential metabolic alteration in CKD. However, the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and aldehydes is not explicitly established, indicating a lack of direct interaction or relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as aldehydes are part of the volatile organic compounds detected in the study, but there is no specific discussion linking 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene to the observed changes in aldehyde levels in CKD rats.",
        "score": 2
