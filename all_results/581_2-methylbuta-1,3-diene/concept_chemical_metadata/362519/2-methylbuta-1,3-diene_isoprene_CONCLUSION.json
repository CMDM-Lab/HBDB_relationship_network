[11] exABA, Exogenous ABA; AZ, abscission zone. [1] As a concluding comment, future applications involving the measurement of isoprene emission at the field level may be useful to predict the fruit load. [2] Isoprene is an important parameter from an environmental point of view, and for this reason, its levels have already been monitored with different systems, including satellite observations . [3] However, the resolution of these imaging systems is not sufficient to provide precise data at the orchard level. [4] A high-resolution dedicated system is therefore being developed to test its efficacy in predicting fruit load and, consequently, allow thinning treatments to be tuned according to a modern environmentally friendly precision agriculture. [1] Experiments were conducted over four different years on apple (Malus domestica) trees of cv Golden Delicious/M9 and Red Chief/M26 trained with standard horticultural practices at the experimental farm Maso Part of the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Adige, Edmund Mach Foundation.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be emitted by plants, particularly in relation to environmental monitoring and agricultural practices. The mention of isoprene highlights its significance in predicting fruit load, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may share similar ecological roles or emissions patterns, although the specific relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed in the context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as both are VOCs relevant to environmental studies. However, their specific interactions or functional relationships are not elaborated upon in the context.",
