    "context": " [7] This induces nutrient starvation in actively growing organs such as young fruits; the effect is therefore similar to that of BA.  [8] Control and treated fruitlets of two genotypes were collected and subjected to an untargeted analysis performed by means of proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS; ).  [9] This approach allowed their volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions to be measured and linked both to the corresponding AP and the sequence of events occurring at the molecular and metabolic levels. [10] A set of candidate markers was identified, among which isoprene showed the highest statistical score. [11] A relationship between the emission of this volatile and ABA content in the fruit cortex was also observed, with interesting implications related to their biological activities. [1] Natural and chemically induced fruit drop dynamics were followed until their conclusion in two commercial apple genotypes, cv Golden Delicious and Red Chief, which are characterized by significant differences in their natural AP and sensitivity to thinning chemicals. [2] While the former usually shows a high fruit set as well as a consequently high AP, and can be easily thinned with BA, the latter normally displays lower fruit set and AP, and is insensitive to this chemical.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from fruitlets during a study on nutrient starvation and its effects on fruit development. Isoprene is highlighted as a candidate marker with a significant statistical score, suggesting its importance in the biological activities related to the fruit's response to abscisic acid (ABA) content. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association as VOCs rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are mentioned in the context of VOC emissions from fruitlets, with isoprene being specifically noted for its statistical significance. However, their direct relationship or interaction is not clearly defined.",
        "score": 3
