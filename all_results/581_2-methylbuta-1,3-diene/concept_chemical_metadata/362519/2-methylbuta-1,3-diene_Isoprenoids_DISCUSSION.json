    "context": "[3] The Pearson correlation coefficients and their P level of significance are also shown. [4] L1, Small lateral fruitlets; L3, big lateral fruitlets; C1, small central fruitlets; C3, big central fruitlets.  [1] Isoprenoid compounds are thought to play a pivotal role in abiotic stress tolerance, according to the mechanistic view of a single biochemical mechanism for multiple physiological stressors .  [2] It is demonstrated here that the isoprenoid pathway was activated and isoprene emission increased during the induction of abscission in apple fruitlets.  [3] Isoprene may thus represent a potential marker to predict the fruit destiny early.  [4] It is not surprising that isoprene is highly emitted by organs, such as the AFs, suffering shortage of assimilates.  [5] In fact, isoprenoid emissions have often been found to be sustained when carbon supply becomes scarce under stress conditions or even in the presence of null photosynthetic rates (; ; ; ; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is identified as a significant isoprenoid compound involved in abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The isoprenoid pathway's activation leads to increased isoprene emissions during stress conditions, indicating that isoprene serves as a marker for physiological responses in fruitlets under stress. This highlights the critical role of isoprenoids in plant stress responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is explicitly categorized as an isoprenoid and is discussed in the context of its physiological role and significance in stress tolerance mechanisms.",
