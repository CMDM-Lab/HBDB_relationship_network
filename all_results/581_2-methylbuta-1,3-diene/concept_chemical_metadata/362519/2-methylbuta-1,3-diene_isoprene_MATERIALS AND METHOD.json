However, the context does not provide any specific details about their relationship or interactions. They are listed in association with VOC emissions and fruit characteristics, but no direct connection is established between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs and are mentioned in the same context related to plant emissions. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
