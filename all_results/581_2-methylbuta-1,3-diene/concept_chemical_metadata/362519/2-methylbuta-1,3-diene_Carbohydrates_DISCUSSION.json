    "context": "[1] These results may also provide some interesting indications about the balance of metabolic fluxes feeding isoprene biosynthesis. [2] The majority of the carbon incorporated in this molecule was proven to come from photosynthesis in several species (; ; ; ; ; ; ), although additional sources either chloroplastic, such as starch degradation , or extrachloroplastic, such as transported carbohydrates (; ), or CO2 coming from mitochondrial respiration , may also contribute. [3] In abscising apple fruitlets, isoprene biosynthesis was shown to be sustained even with photosynthesis inhibition, which is known to occur soon after MET treatments in apple and persist up to 5 d after the chemical application . [4] Moreover, the nutritional stress caused by both BA and MET indirectly reduces the already low assimilate availability to the sinks (i.e. the fruitlets), suggesting that a contribution to isoprene biosynthesis from transported carbohydrates may be ruled out. [5] Taking into account that  observed an increase of Suc and a decrease of starch concentration in the cortex of AFs, it may be hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis in these fruits is supported by both starch degradation and respiration (following Suc breakdown). [6] Specific investigations will be focused on these aspects to shed light on which metabolisms are more active in feeding isoprene biosynthesis in apple fruitlets undergoing a nutritional stress, such as that caused by the thinning treatments. [1] The determination of ABA levels in the cortex allowed the identification of a significant correlation between the hormone content and isoprene emission (Fig. 5). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor to isoprene biosynthesis, is linked to carbohydrates through metabolic processes. The carbon for isoprene is primarily derived from photosynthesis, but carbohydrates, particularly from starch degradation and respiration, also contribute to its biosynthesis. The study suggests that during nutritional stress in apple fruitlets, the availability of carbohydrates influences isoprene production, indicating a metabolic interplay between carbohydrates and isoprene synthesis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbohydrates, as the context discusses how carbohydrates contribute to isoprene biosynthesis, particularly under conditions of nutritional stress. This relationship is supported by evidence of metabolic fluxes and the role of carbohydrates in the process.",
