    "context": "[3] Also shown are the Pearson correlation coefficients and relevant P level of significance. [4] L1, Small laterals; L3, big laterals; C3, big centrals. [1] The relationship between ABA, isoprene, and fruit drop was examined more closely by applying ABA to apple trees. [2] The effects of ABA treatments at different concentrations on fruit drop and isoprene emission were assessed in cv Golden Delicious trees at phenological stages that are suitable for chemical thinning. [3] Total fruit drop was significantly affected only by the ABA treatment at 100 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 (about +25% in both 2011 and 2012; Supplemental Fig. S4). [4] Based on the daily measurements of shed fruitlets, it was deduced that the increased abscission was due mainly to the shedding of the L3 class (data not shown). [5] It is worth noting that fruit drop of control trees was higher than usual (for a comparison see the inset of Fig. 1), most likely because of particularly favorable climatic conditions during flowering, which resulted in a high fruit set.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a chemical related to the study of isoprene emissions and their effects on fruit drop in apple trees. However, the term 'Chemicals' is used broadly and does not provide specific information about the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and other chemicals. The context primarily focuses on the effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on fruit drop and isoprene emission, with 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene being one of the chemicals involved but lacking detailed interaction or significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to isoprene emissions, which are part of a broader category of chemicals. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or interaction with other chemicals in the context provided.",
