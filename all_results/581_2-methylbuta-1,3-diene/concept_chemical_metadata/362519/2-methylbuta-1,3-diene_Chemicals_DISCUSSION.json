    "context": "[10] In addition, because MDP0000793656 was shown to be substantially unaffected by the ABA treatment, a positive feedback control exerted by the hormone on DXS transcription may be unlikely. [1] These results may also provide some interesting indications about the balance of metabolic fluxes feeding isoprene biosynthesis. [2] The majority of the carbon incorporated in this molecule was proven to come from photosynthesis in several species (; ; ; ; ; ; ), although additional sources either chloroplastic, such as starch degradation , or extrachloroplastic, such as transported carbohydrates (; ), or CO2 coming from mitochondrial respiration , may also contribute. [3] In abscising apple fruitlets, isoprene biosynthesis was shown to be sustained even with photosynthesis inhibition, which is known to occur soon after MET treatments in apple and persist up to 5 d after the chemical application . [4] Moreover, the nutritional stress caused by both BA and MET indirectly reduces the already low assimilate availability to the sinks (i.e. the fruitlets), suggesting that a contribution to isoprene biosynthesis from transported carbohydrates may be ruled out. [5] Taking into account that  observed an increase of Suc and a decrease of starch concentration in the cortex of AFs, it may be hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis in these fruits is supported by both starch degradation and respiration (following Suc breakdown). [6] Specific investigations will be focused on these aspects to shed light on which metabolisms are more active in feeding isoprene biosynthesis in apple fruitlets undergoing a nutritional stress, such as that caused by the thinning treatments.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in apple fruitlets under nutritional stress. While the term 'Chemicals' is broadly mentioned, it does not provide specific details or interactions regarding 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. The focus is primarily on metabolic pathways and the sources of carbon for isoprene biosynthesis, rather than a direct relationship with other chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a chemical compound involved in metabolic processes, but the context does not elaborate on its specific interactions with other chemicals or its broader implications.",
