[1] DXS has been shown to be a rate-limiting enzyme for plastidic isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants , and a likely transcriptional regulation of the step catalyzed by DXS was suggested, at least for carotenoids biosynthesis during tomato fruit ripening .  [2] For this reason, the expression of the corresponding gene/s in apple fruitlets may be an important physiological indicator of the regulatory mechanisms triggered during the early phases of abscission induction to support both isoprene and ABA biosynthesis.  [3] Four candidate DXS genes were identified in apple, three of which belonging to class II (MDP0000253802, MDP0000253952, and MDP0000793656) and one to class I (MDP0000798878), according to the classification of  and ; see the phylogenetic analysis in Supplemental Fig. S7).  [4] Expression of MDP0000253802 was substantially unaffected by BA in all fruit classes and time points and also by ABA at abscission-inducing concentration (100 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191; Fig. 7).  [5] MDP0000253952 transcription was strongly up-regulated in BA-treated C3 fruitlets at both time points, whereas in L1 and L3, it was inhibited by the thinning treatment, especially in the former class.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both isoprenoid compounds involved in plant biosynthesis. The expression of genes related to isoprene production, such as DXS, is crucial for the biosynthesis of these compounds in plants. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific functional relationships between the two compounds beyond their classification as isoprenoids.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are mentioned in the context of isoprenoid biosynthesis in plants, indicating a shared significance. However, their specific interactions or roles are not elaborated upon.",
