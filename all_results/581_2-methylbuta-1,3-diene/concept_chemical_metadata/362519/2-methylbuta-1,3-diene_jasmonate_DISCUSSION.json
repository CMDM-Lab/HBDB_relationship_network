    "context": "[11] In this specific case, however, ROS levels did not decrease as a consequence of increased isoprene emission, probably because abscission induction was at this point irreversible. [12] Isoprene, in addition to acting directly as an antioxidant, may also be involved in specific signaling pathways leading to a broader cellular response to abiotic stresses. [13] Cooperating with NO, isoprene was shown to reduce oxidative damage in leaves , and this effect is likely to be dependent upon interactions occurring at the signaling level rather than direct scavenging reactions . [14] The involvement of NO in the signal cascade that initiates the hypersensitive response occurring in plant-pathogen interactions  and its cooperation with isoprene may suggest that a number of other processes are also likely to be affected, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the elicitation of jasmonate and salicylate signaling pathways typically involved in the hypersensitive response . [15] Transcriptomic analyses performed by  indicate that the above-cited processes were triggered early (at 17 DAPF) during abscission induction, especially concerning the up-regulation of genes coding for a jasmonate-induced protein, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. [16] For the latter two genes, a role in the cross talk with ethylene signaling, which is activated downstream , may be hypothesized, along with an interaction with NO signaling, as previously pointed out (; ).  [1] Short-term changes in isoprene emission are primarily determined by availability of the isoprene synthase substrate dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (; ; ; ; ; ), which is synthesized by the MEP pathway.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its role in signaling pathways that may involve jasmonate during plant responses to abiotic stresses. Isoprene is suggested to cooperate with nitric oxide (NO) in initiating signaling cascades that lead to the elicitation of jasmonate and salicylate pathways, which are crucial for the hypersensitive response in plants. This indicates a potential interaction where isoprene may influence jasmonate signaling, although the specifics of this relationship are not deeply elaborated.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) is implicated in signaling pathways that involve jasmonate, indicating some level of interaction. However, the details of their relationship are not extensively discussed, limiting the strength of the connection.",
