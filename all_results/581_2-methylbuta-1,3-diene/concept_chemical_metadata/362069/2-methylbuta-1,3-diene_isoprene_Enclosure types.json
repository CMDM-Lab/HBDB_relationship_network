    "context": "Also, the leaf orientation can be controlled to be perpendicular to the light source. Leaf cuvettes are generally designed for photosynthesis studies, but with some modifications, they can also be used for BVOC emission measurements. Isoprene is extremely volatile, which reduces the risk of wall losses (see Section 5), and isoprene emission rates from many trees can be 10\u20131000 times greater than those for MT or SQT. The resulting high concentrations and negligible analyte losses typically make leaf cuvettes suitable for studying temperature and light effects on isoprene emissions (Guenther et al., 1991; Harley et al., 1996). The internal surface area of a leaf cuvette is large relative to the amount of biomass that is enclosed. Materials used in commercial systems are generally not designed to be chemically inert towards heavier BVOC, and semi-volatile and reactive compounds are prone to be lost in a leaf cuvette. Synthetic materials used in commercial leaf cuvettes have also been found to create analytical interferences from out-gassing (Harley, P., National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, C.O., Helmig, D., unpublished results).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they both belong to the class of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The discussion focuses on isoprene's high volatility and emission rates compared to other BVOCs, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may share similar properties, although it is not explicitly mentioned in terms of its emission characteristics or significance in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both classified as BVOCs. However, the context does not provide detailed information on their specific interactions or comparative significance, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
