    "context": "The critical question then becomes: What will the overall uncertainties be in estimating whole-canopy fluxes given the uncertainties in emission rates and scaling parameters? Findings from independent techniques are needed to test the validity of scaling results, but, as previously mentioned, relatively few studies have reported long-term BVOC fluxes using micrometeorological techniques (such as eddy covariance or relaxed eddy accumulation) from a site where species characterization and emission rate data for the scaling-up of emission rates are available. Ortega et al. (2007) scaled branch-level isoprene emission rates and compared those to above-canopy eddy covariance fluxes reported by Pressley et al. (2005) from the same mixed hardwood forest site in Michigan. They showed that isoprene fluxes from the two methods agreed favorably; the mean cumulative (seasonal) fluxes differed by less than 30%, which given the aforementioned constraints, is well within the uncertainties of these techniques. Comparisons of independent BVOC flux measurements from other sites would be useful to further improve scaling models and confidence in the applicability of this technique. 14 Conclusions Enclosure methods are valuable tools for determining BVOC emission rates under laboratory and field conditions from portions of leaves, single leaves, whole branches, entire plants, and potted plants including the soil. Previous studies published in the literature demonstrate a high variability of techniques and of measured parameters among numerous researchers. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as both are biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from vegetation. The study discusses isoprene fluxes and their measurement techniques, implying that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may share similar emission characteristics or ecological roles as isoprene, although the specific relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both mentioned in the context of BVOC emissions. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific functional relationship.",
