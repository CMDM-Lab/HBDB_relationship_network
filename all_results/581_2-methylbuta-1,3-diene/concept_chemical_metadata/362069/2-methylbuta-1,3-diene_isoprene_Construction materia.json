    "context": "Second, surfaces should be inert to prevent losses due to uptake and chemical reactions, and third, the materials should be transparent to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in the 400\u2013700nm wavelength range. The potential for analyte adsorption losses generally increases with decreasing vapor pressure (which is a function of the molecular weight and boiling point). Isoprene (C5H8) has a boiling point of 34\u00b0C while MT (C10H16) and SQT (C15H24) have boiling points in the range of 155\u2013175\u00b0C and 240\u2013275\u00b0C, respectively. Calculated saturation gas-phase concentrations for SQT, MT and isoprene (at 25\u00b0C and 1atm pressure) range from 101 to 105 ppmv and are several orders of magnitude greater than typical BVOC mixing ratios achieved in enclosure experiments. However, adsorptive losses occur at mixing ratios well below saturation and have been observed at low ppbv levels, and they can be a significant fraction of the total signal (Helmig et al., 2004). Therefore, it is important to choose materials with low surface areas and low affinities for these analytes. This is especially important for heavier compounds such as SQT. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with specific boiling points and saturation gas-phase concentrations. Isoprene, with a boiling point of 34\u00b0C, is highlighted in relation to other compounds like MT and SQT, but there is no direct discussion of their chemical relationship or interactions. The focus is on their physical properties and the implications for analyte adsorption losses rather than a specific connection between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs with similar properties, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions in the context provided.",
