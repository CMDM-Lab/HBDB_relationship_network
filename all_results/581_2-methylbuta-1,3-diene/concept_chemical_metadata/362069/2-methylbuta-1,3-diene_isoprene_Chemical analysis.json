    "context": "Only a brief overview of the most popular methods is provided here and the reader is referred to these references and to analytical journals for more detailed descriptions. There are a number of advantages of on-site analysis, as the instantaneously available results allow for adjustments in the sampling strategy of an ongoing experiment. These measurements also provide higher time resolution for investigating parameters that control emissions. In situ measurements of isoprene have been accomplished with chemiluminescence detectors (Guenther et al., 1996b, Singsaas and Sharkey, 2000), argon ionization detectors (Sharkey et al., 1996), photoionization detectors (Keller and Lerdau, 1999) and reduction gas detectors (Harley et al., 1996; Geron et al., 2000). PTR-MS is another technique that is increasingly utilized in BVOC research because of its high time resolution and ability to monitor multiple compounds simultaneously (De Gouw et al., 1999; Karl et al., 2001; Tani et al., 2003; Graus et al., 2004; Steeghs et al., 2004). PTR-MS has been useful in demonstrating the time- and light-dependent synthesis and emissions of certain compounds (Graus et al., 2004; Tholl et al., 2006 and references therein). However, there are some challenges with using this technique. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to biogenic emissions. However, the text primarily discusses analytical methods for measuring isoprene without detailing any specific relationship or interaction between the two compounds. They are grouped under the broader category of BVOCs, but no direct connection is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to emissions studies, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions in the provided context.",
