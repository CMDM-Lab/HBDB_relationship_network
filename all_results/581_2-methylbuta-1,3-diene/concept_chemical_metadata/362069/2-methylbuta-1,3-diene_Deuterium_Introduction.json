    "context": "Because of these analytical challenges in measuring reactive BVOC, there has been only limited success in measuring their fluxes at the canopy scale (Ciccioli et al., 1999). Leaf- and branch-level enclosure experiments provide viable alternatives for obtaining fluxes of reactive and low-volatility compounds when ambient measurements are not possible. Several investigators have measured isoprene emissions at the leaf- and branch-level and have characterized these emissions with respect to leaf development, light environment, canopy position, and temperature history (Harley et al., 1996; Sharkey et al., 1996; Geron et al., 2000; Singsaas and Sharkey, 2000; P\u00e9tron et al., 2001). Isotopic labeling experiments using 13C or deuterium have been performed to finely characterize time-dependent isoprene production and emissions (Tholl et al., 2006; and references therein). Branch-level emissions of compounds other than isoprene (e.g. MT, SQT, oxygenated BVOC) are more difficult to quantify because of the reasons previously discussed. Although challenging to obtain, quantitative emission rates of these other BVOC compounds from enclosures can be used to estimate whole-canopy fluxes and their roles in atmospheric processes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and deuterium are related through isotopic labeling experiments aimed at characterizing isoprene production and emissions. Deuterium, as a stable isotope, is used to trace and analyze the dynamics of isoprene fluxes in various environmental conditions. This relationship highlights the methodological approach to studying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene, but does not delve into direct interactions between the two substances.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as deuterium is utilized in isotopic labeling to study the emissions of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, indicating a significant methodological connection. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or implications beyond this analytical approach.",
