    "context": "The Agilent GC/MS system used to analyze these samples is more sensitive to MNT than the Inficon GC/MS, and also more foliage was enclosed in the branch system, increasing overall sensitivity to the MNT compounds. A large peak eluting just before \u03b2-myrcene indicated emission of an unidentified MNT compound, which was present in all branch samples and was the most abundant MNT emitted from Q.\u00a0alba. The aromatic p-cymene has been found in Quercus emissions in previous studies (Geron et\u00a0al., 2000b). In this study p-cymene emissions appeared to decline at higher temperatures relative to isoprene emission and showed an inconsistent response to increasing T L from each species with the exception of Q.\u00a0alba in June. The p-cymene was comparable to the pinenes in both the ambient and branch enclosure canister samples.Comparison of leaf vs canopy monoterpene fluxes Canopy average M L rates (Table\u00a04) are at least an order of magnitude lower than the rates used in MEGAN for North American broadleaf deciduous temperate forest canopies and warrant additional attention. MEGAN appears to simulate observed above canopy MNT fluxes (Seco et\u00a0al., 2015) reasonably well, although MEGAN assumes that only 50% of the MNT flux is light dependent. The flux data indicate a much higher percentage of light-dependent MNT, consistent with MNT emissions from foliage such as oaks, maples, and poplars with no known storage structures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from foliage, particularly in relation to the emissions from Quercus alba. While isoprene is specifically noted for its emission patterns, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be part of the broader category of MNT compounds analyzed. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both VOCs emitted from plants. However, the context does not provide specific details on their interaction or comparative significance, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
