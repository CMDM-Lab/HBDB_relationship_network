    "context": "Field studies of affected areas on the Mark Twain National Forest revealed most mortality occurred in oak stands over 60 years old with trees more than 14 inches in diameter (Law and Gott, 1987), similar to the size and age of the oaks within the canopy at the MOFLUX tower site. Given the large variability in physiological, growth, and survival responses to drought between Quercus species, it seems reasonable to expect that l I L and leaf-level monoterpene (M L ) emission rates may also show varying response to drought stress among the oaks. We attempted to characterize this variability by examining I L and M L from several oak species before, during and after the severe drought experienced in the Ozarks in the summer of 2012. We compare these observations with the above canopy fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes measured during the course of the growing season. Leaf isoprene emission rates (I L , in \u03bcgC (g leaf dry weight)\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 unless otherwise specified) were measured by enclosing portions of leaves in the cuvette of two LI-COR 6400 plant photosynthesis systems (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Exit air was ported to two Photovac (Perkin\u2013Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) photoionization detection (PID) systems as described in Geron et\u00a0al. (2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned alongside monoterpenes as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from oak trees. The study investigates the emission rates of these compounds in response to drought stress among different oak species. While both terms are related as types of VOCs produced by plants, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes is not deeply explored beyond their co-occurrence in the study of emissions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes are discussed in the context of plant emissions, indicating a shared significance in the study of VOCs. However, their specific interactions or comparative analysis are not detailed.",
