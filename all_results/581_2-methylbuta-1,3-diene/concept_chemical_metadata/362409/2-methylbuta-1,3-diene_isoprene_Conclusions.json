    "context": "These effects varied significantly between species, and it is important to note that such effects cannot be detected from whole-canopy flux studies. Even within an oak canopy classification, variation in species composition could result in significant differences in response to drought and high temperatures. For instance, a forest stand composed of Q. stellata, Q.\u00a0muehlenbergii, and Q.\u00a0macrocarpa could produce dramatically different isoprene fluxes during dry, hot conditions compared to a forest dominated by Q.\u00a0alba, Q.\u00a0rubra, and Q.\u00a0velutina. Taken together, however, the drought responses of the individual species at MOFLUX are generally consistent with canopy fluxes of isoprene given the Quercus species composition near the tower. The leaf level data are also consistent with laboratory effects of drought on I L documented in previous studies, suggesting a drought-induced breakdown of the dependence of I L on T L particularly within the Erythrobalanus subgenus of Quercus. Low levels of leaf monoterpene emissions measured before and during the drought of 2012 suggest that non-oak sources of these compounds may be controlling above canopy fluxes. Additional leaf-level studies are needed in the field for both I L and M L during drought-affected growing seasons. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants, particularly under stress conditions such as drought. The study discusses isoprene fluxes in relation to different oak species, implying that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may also play a role in similar emissions, although it is not explicitly mentioned. Their relationship is rooted in their shared characteristics as plant-emitted VOCs, but specific interactions or comparisons are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as both are VOCs associated with plant emissions. However, the context does not provide a detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions, limiting the relevance.",
