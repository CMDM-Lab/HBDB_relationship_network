    "context": "Given the large variability in physiological, growth, and survival responses to drought between Quercus species, it seems reasonable to expect that l I L and leaf-level monoterpene (M L ) emission rates may also show varying response to drought stress among the oaks. We attempted to characterize this variability by examining I L and M L from several oak species before, during and after the severe drought experienced in the Ozarks in the summer of 2012. We compare these observations with the above canopy fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes measured during the course of the growing season. Leaf isoprene emission rates (I L , in \u03bcgC (g leaf dry weight)\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 unless otherwise specified) were measured by enclosing portions of leaves in the cuvette of two LI-COR 6400 plant photosynthesis systems (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Exit air was ported to two Photovac (Perkin\u2013Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) photoionization detection (PID) systems as described in Geron et\u00a0al. (2002). Additionally, Tenax TA/Carboxen 563 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) adsorbent cartridges were used to sample from the Li-Cor exit air for analysis with an Inficon (East Syracuse, NY, USA) HAPSITE ER gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer (GC/MS) system with a thermal desorption unit, which allowed on-site identification and quantitation of isoprene and monoterpenes.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound emitted by oak species in response to drought stress, while Protium, a stable isotope of hydrogen, is not directly discussed or linked to the emissions or physiological responses of the oak species. There is no clear relationship established between the two terms within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Protium, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
