    "context": "Field studies of affected areas on the Mark Twain National Forest revealed most mortality occurred in oak stands over 60 years old with trees more than 14 inches in diameter (Law and Gott, 1987), similar to the size and age of the oaks within the canopy at the MOFLUX tower site. Given the large variability in physiological, growth, and survival responses to drought between Quercus species, it seems reasonable to expect that l I L and leaf-level monoterpene (M L ) emission rates may also show varying response to drought stress among the oaks. We attempted to characterize this variability by examining I L and M L from several oak species before, during and after the severe drought experienced in the Ozarks in the summer of 2012. We compare these observations with the above canopy fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes measured during the course of the growing season. Leaf isoprene emission rates (I L , in \u03bcgC (g leaf dry weight)\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 unless otherwise specified) were measured by enclosing portions of leaves in the cuvette of two LI-COR 6400 plant photosynthesis systems (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Exit air was ported to two Photovac (Perkin\u2013Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) photoionization detection (PID) systems as described in Geron et\u00a0al. (2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants, particularly oak species. The study examines isoprene emission rates from oak leaves during drought conditions, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may also be emitted in similar contexts. However, the specific relationship between these two compounds is not directly discussed, indicating a general association rather than a detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both VOCs emitted by plants, but the context does not provide detailed information on their specific interactions or comparative significance.",
