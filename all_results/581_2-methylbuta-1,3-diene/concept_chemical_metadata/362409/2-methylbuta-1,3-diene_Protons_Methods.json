    "context": "Because the sensitivity of the analytical system varied with ambient temperature, the isoprene detection system was calibrated after approximately every fifth measurement using a standard cylinder containing 45\u00a0ppbv isoprene, referenced to an NIST Butene/Benzene standard using gas chromatography (Model 7890a, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with both a flame ionization detector and an electron ionization mass-selective detector. In August, an additional photosynthesis system (MPH-1000, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA) was deployed. Leaves were enclosed in a custom-built temperature-controlled, fan-stirred glass cuvette (Allen Scientific Glass, Boulder, CO, USA) 12.5\u00a0cm in diameter (volume of 425\u00a0cm3) and concentrations of CO2 and H2O measured using an Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA, Model LI-6262, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA, see Harley et\u00a0al., 2014 for complete description). Exhaust gas leaving the cuvette was ported to an Ionicon proton transfer time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS 8000, Ionicon Analytik, Austria) and isoprene concentrations were monitored at protonated m/z 69.066. A thorough description and characterization of the PTR-TOF-MS instrument is given by Graus et\u00a0al. (2010) and the data reduction was performed with the software developed by M\u00fcller et\u00a0al. (2013). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is detected and monitored using a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). Protons play a crucial role in the ionization process of isoprene, as the mass spectrometer detects the protonated form of isoprene at a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z 69.066). This indicates a direct relationship where protons are essential for the analytical detection of isoprene concentrations in the exhaust gas.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and protons, as protons are directly involved in the detection process of isoprene in the mass spectrometer. The context provides clear evidence of their interaction in the analytical method used.",
        "score": 4
