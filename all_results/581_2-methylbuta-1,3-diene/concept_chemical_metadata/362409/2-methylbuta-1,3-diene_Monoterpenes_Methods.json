    "context": "The SUMMA canisters were pressurized to 10\u201326 psig using ambient air or a subsample of the exit air from the dynamic branch enclosure system. Canisters were transported to the laboratory in Portland, OR, USA, and within two weeks were evacuated onto a two-bed (Tenax TA and Carbotrap) Markes cartridge and desorbed using a Markes-1 thermal desorption/preconcentration system. Output was analyzed on an Agilent 6980N gas chromatograph and Agilent 5973 mass selective detector operated in selected ion mode (SIM). The SIM detector response to BVOCs relative to CCl4 (assumed to be 100\u00a0ppt) was used to approximate BVOC concentrations in the canister samples, although these samples were used primarily to analyze ratios of isoprene to monoterpene (MNT) and relative abundance of individual MNT compounds. Leaf isoprene emissions The June I L measurements using the PID and LICOR systems showed basal emission rates (I L at PPFD\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121 and T L \u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0\u00b0C) that ranged from 80 to 120 \u03bcgC\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (Table\u00a04 ). These rates fall within the range observed by Geron et\u00a0al. (2001) for Q. alba, Q.\u00a0rubra, Q.\u00a0stellata, and Q.\u00a0velutina in North Carolina, USA. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that is analyzed alongside monoterpenes (MNT) in the study of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. The focus is on the ratios of isoprene to monoterpenes and the relative abundance of individual monoterpene compounds, indicating that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is part of the broader category of monoterpenes but does not have a detailed interaction or specific relationship highlighted in the analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to BVOCs and are analyzed together, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
