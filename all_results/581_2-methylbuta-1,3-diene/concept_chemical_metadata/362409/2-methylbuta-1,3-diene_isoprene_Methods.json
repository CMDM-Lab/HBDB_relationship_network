    "context": "The SUMMA canisters were pressurized to 10\u201326 psig using ambient air or a subsample of the exit air from the dynamic branch enclosure system. Canisters were transported to the laboratory in Portland, OR, USA, and within two weeks were evacuated onto a two-bed (Tenax TA and Carbotrap) Markes cartridge and desorbed using a Markes-1 thermal desorption/preconcentration system. Output was analyzed on an Agilent 6980N gas chromatograph and Agilent 5973 mass selective detector operated in selected ion mode (SIM). The SIM detector response to BVOCs relative to CCl4 (assumed to be 100\u00a0ppt) was used to approximate BVOC concentrations in the canister samples, although these samples were used primarily to analyze ratios of isoprene to monoterpene (MNT) and relative abundance of individual MNT compounds. Leaf isoprene emissions The June I L measurements using the PID and LICOR systems showed basal emission rates (I L at PPFD\u00a0=\u00a01000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0s\u22121 and T L \u00a0=\u00a030\u00a0\u00b0C) that ranged from 80 to 120 \u03bcgC\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (Table\u00a04 ). These rates fall within the range observed by Geron et\u00a0al. (2001) for Q. alba, Q.\u00a0rubra, Q.\u00a0stellata, and Q.\u00a0velutina in North Carolina, USA. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) analyzed in relation to their emissions from leaves. The study focuses on measuring isoprene emissions and comparing them to monoterpene concentrations, indicating that both compounds are part of the same ecological and chemical analysis, but their specific relationship is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are categorized as BVOCs and are analyzed in the same study. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their inclusion in the analysis.",
