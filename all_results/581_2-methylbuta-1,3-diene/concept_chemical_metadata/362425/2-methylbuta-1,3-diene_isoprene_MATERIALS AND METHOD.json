        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by plants, particularly during photosynthesis. Isoprene is a well-known product of plant metabolism, and 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or detailed discussions about their roles or significance in the studied scenarios.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both VOCs related to plant metabolism. However, the context lacks detailed discussion of their specific relationship or functional interactions.",
        "score": 2
