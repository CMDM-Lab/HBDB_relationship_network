    "context": "[1] Online determination of isoprene (m69), MeOH (m33), m71, LOX products (m99 and m101), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (m137 and m205, respectively) was conducted simultaneously to the gas-exchange measurements using a high-sensitivity PTR-QMS (Ionicon Analytik) at a sampling flow rate of 200 mL min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191. [2] The PTR-QMS switched between the two infrared gas analyzers every 2 d. [3] The details of the PTR-QMS operating parameters and the calibration procedures are given elsewhere (; ). [4] In addition, the sum of the isoprene oxidation products MVK and MACR was calculated at m71, after subtracting the amount of isoprene occurring as stable 13C isotope (i.e. [5] 13C212C3H8; 0.305% of m69). [6] The first 1 min of each measurement after switching the subchambers was always discarded in order to avoid any memory effects. [7] VOC concentrations in the inlet air of the subchambers were used as background and therefore subtracted from the outlet concentrations every 20 min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is analyzed alongside stable isotopes, specifically the stable 13C isotope, to quantify isoprene oxidation products. The presence of the stable isotope allows for the differentiation of isoprene from its oxidation products during gas-exchange measurements, indicating a methodological relationship where stable isotopes are used to enhance the accuracy of isoprene quantification in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the stable isotope is utilized in the analysis of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene to improve measurement accuracy. However, the relationship is primarily methodological rather than indicating a direct biochemical interaction.",
