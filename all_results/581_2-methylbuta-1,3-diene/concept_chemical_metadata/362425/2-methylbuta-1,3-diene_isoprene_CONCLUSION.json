    "context": "[2] The data clearly showed that whole-plant isoprene fluxes increased dynamically and strongly under the HDSs, although the plants developed fewer and smaller leaves under these conditions. [3] The poplars were able to tolerate PS and CS events but paid for their stress adaption with temporarily reduced A and C gain. [4] However, the higher photosynthesis rates at the end of the recovery phase suggest that the impact of periodic and chronic HDSs on growth and biomass can be compensated under unstressed conditions in due time. [5] The comparison of photosynthesis, growth, and stress parameters in the IE and NE poplars suggests that isoprene emission does not enhance plant stress mitigation under the future climate in poplar.  [1] The experiments were conducted with four genotypes of Grey poplar (Populus \u00c3\u2014 canescens [INRA clone 7171-B4]; syn.  [2] Populus tremula \u00c3\u2014 Populus alba).  [3] Two IE genotypes (wild type and PcISPS:GUS/GFP, in which the PcISPS promoter was fused to the GUS and GFP reporter genes; for details, see ) and two well-characterized NE transgenic genotypes (35S::PcISPS-RNAi lines RA1 and RA2; ; ) were used.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are closely related as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. The study discusses isoprene emissions from poplar plants under stress conditions, indicating that isoprene plays a role in plant responses to environmental stress. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their connection in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both terms are related through their chemical structure and the context of isoprene emissions in plants, but the specific interaction or significance of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene in relation to isoprene is not detailed.",
