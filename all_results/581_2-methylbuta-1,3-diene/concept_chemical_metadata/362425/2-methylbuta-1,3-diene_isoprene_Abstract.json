    "context": "[3] Using Grey poplar (Populus \u00c3\u2014 canescens) wild type and well-established transgenic genotypes, which are almost completely suppressed in isoprene emission , we aimed to address the following questions. [4] (1) What are the dynamics of photosynthesis and VOC emissions under the different climate scenarios? [5] (2) Is the ability to tolerate stress and to recover different between short-term and long-term heat and drought spells (HDSs), and what are the costs (in terms of C gain) that poplars will pay under the projected future climate? [6] (3) Is the trait isoprene emission essential for poplar to adapt to fast-changing environmental extremes and to influence the recovery after stress? [1] We studied the photosynthetic performance of isoprene-emitting (IE) and nonemitting (NE) plants under averaged present-day and projected future climates (Fig. 1) by measuring the net plant (canopy) CO2 flux (i.e. the net ecosystem exchange [NEE]) and evapotranspiration rate (Fig. 2) of the plants. [2] NEE was equal in IE and NE poplars in the control scenarios (ambient and elevated [CO2]); overall, elevated [CO2] increased the NEE (P = 0.001). [3] HDSs significantly decreased (all P values are given in Supplemental Table S1) the NEE under PS and CS in both IE and NE plants (Fig. 2) compared with plants that were grown in the control chambers under ambient and enhanced [CO2].

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are closely related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants, particularly in the study of Grey poplar (Populus \u00d7 canescens). The research focuses on the dynamics of isoprene emission and its potential role in plant stress tolerance and recovery under climate change scenarios. The study aims to understand how isoprene emission affects photosynthesis and plant adaptation, indicating a significant relationship between the two compounds in the context of plant physiology and environmental response.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as both are studied in the context of plant VOC emissions and their roles in stress tolerance. The research highlights their significance in plant adaptation to climate change, supported by evidence of their physiological impacts.",
