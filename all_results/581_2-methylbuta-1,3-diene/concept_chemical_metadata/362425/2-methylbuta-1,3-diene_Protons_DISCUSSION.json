    "context": "[5] However, LOX emissions upon dehydration have been detected as early stress responses on cut grass (; ). [6] These drought treatments were, in contrast to our climate change scenarios, rather extreme and artificial and resulted in fast dehydration that normally does not occur in natural drought progression. [7] It was proposed that, under oxidative stress, a substantial fraction of isoprene is oxidized inside the leaf to MVK and/or MACR . [8] Here, we could not detect any isoprene oxidation products in measurements at the plant level (with a proton-transfer reaction-quadrupole mass spectrometer [PTR-QMS]) or at the leaf level (with a proton-transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometer [PTR-ToF-MS]). [1] While HDSs positively triggered isoprene emission rates and NEE, we observed a long-lasting impairment of plant growth and leaf pigmentation (anthocyanins and flavonols) in both IE and NE plants during HDSs and during the recovery phases. [2] The strong correlation between MeOH emission and RLER clearly demonstrates that MeOH is a suitable indicator of overall plant growth. [3] The phylogenic emission of MeOH is primarily associated with leaf expansion and cell elongation (; ; ), and developing poplar leaves emit significantly more compared with mature ones . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to its oxidation under oxidative stress, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with protons. Protons are referenced in the context of measurement techniques (PTR-QMS and PTR-ToF-MS) used to analyze isoprene emissions and oxidation products. The connection between isoprene and protons is indirect, as protons are part of the analytical methods rather than a chemical interaction or physiological relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the study of isoprene emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction beyond the measurement context.",
