    "context": "[6] Concurrent with the reduction of net C uptake, the amount of C lost as isoprene increased in the IE plants by 6 to 9 times during the periodic or chronic HDSs compared with control conditions. [7] The percentage of photosynthetic C lost as isoprene (daily) increased progressively as the water scarcity became more severe (Supplemental Fig. S6), finally reaching 5.8% at day 20 in the CS scenario. [1] Net C uptake in IE (black bars) and NE (red bars) poplars in the four scenarios (AC, EC, PS, and CS) at the end of the experiment. [2] Net C uptake was calculated based on overall plant fluxes of CO2 and isoprene (see \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Materials and Methods\u00e2\u20ac\u009d), and values for IE and NE plants in each scenario are given as means of four subchambers \u00c2\u00b1 se. [3] The dashed line indicates the reference value of 87 g C m\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 (the mean in the AC scenario for IE plants). [4] The PS and CS scenarios were performed under elevated [CO2]. [1] As an additional measure of leaf performance under abiotic stress, we noninvasively monitored the anthocyanin, flavonol, and chlorophyll contents in the leaves using an optical sensor. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are closely related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by plants, particularly under stress conditions such as water scarcity. The study indicates that the loss of carbon as isoprene increased significantly in response to abiotic stress, suggesting that isoprene production may be a physiological response to environmental challenges, potentially linked to the metabolic pathways involving 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is a structural isomer of isoprene.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as both are involved in plant responses to stress, with isoprene production being quantitatively measured in the context of carbon loss. Their relationship is supported by the context of plant metabolism under stress conditions.",
