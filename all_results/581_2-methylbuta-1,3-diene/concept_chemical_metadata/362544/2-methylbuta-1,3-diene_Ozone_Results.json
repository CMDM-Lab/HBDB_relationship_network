    "context": "[4] Such NOx concentrations are currently widely observed in rural areas of Western Europe , North America, and Asia . [5] Ozone at 100 ppbv has significant detrimental effects on human health and crop yields and enhances global warming through its strong radiative forcing . [1] Sensitivity of daytime (10.00\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16.00 [2] hours) average ozone concentration to concentrations of NOx in the boundary layer, for the isoprene and monoterpene emission rates measured at the rainforest and oil palm landscapes, as computed by CiTTyCAT. [3] Each model run has a similar shape but with a different point of inflection, so the solid lines are not always in the centre of the shaded region. [4] Current measured concentrations of NOx and O3 in the rainforest and plantation are marked. [1] Our measurements show that the conversion of rainforest to oil palm plantation substantially increases VOC and NOx emissions and concentrations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (also known as isoprene) is indirectly related to ozone through its role as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to ozone formation in the atmosphere. The text discusses the sensitivity of ozone concentrations to NOx levels and the impact of land-use changes, such as converting rainforest to oil palm plantations, which increases VOC emissions, including isoprene. This suggests that higher emissions of isoprene can lead to increased ozone levels, which have detrimental effects on health and the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned in the context of its contribution to ozone formation, but the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its role as a VOC affecting ozone levels.",
        "score": 3
