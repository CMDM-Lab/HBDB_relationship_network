    "context": "[4] Such NOx concentrations are currently widely observed in rural areas of Western Europe , North America, and Asia . [5] Ozone at 100 ppbv has significant detrimental effects on human health and crop yields and enhances global warming through its strong radiative forcing . [1] Sensitivity of daytime (10.00\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16.00 [2] hours) average ozone concentration to concentrations of NOx in the boundary layer, for the isoprene and monoterpene emission rates measured at the rainforest and oil palm landscapes, as computed by CiTTyCAT. [3] Each model run has a similar shape but with a different point of inflection, so the solid lines are not always in the centre of the shaded region. [4] Current measured concentrations of NOx and O3 in the rainforest and plantation are marked. [1] Our measurements show that the conversion of rainforest to oil palm plantation substantially increases VOC and NOx emissions and concentrations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are emitted from rainforest and oil palm landscapes. The study highlights the sensitivity of ozone concentration to the emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes, indicating a potential relationship between these compounds in the context of air quality and environmental impact. However, the specific interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to emissions in the studied environments, but their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed in the context.",
