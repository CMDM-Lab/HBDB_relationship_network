    "context": "[3] Surprisingly, ozone concentrations were similar over both landscapes in the boundary layer (rainforest: 11 ppbv; oil palm plantation: 12 ppbv). [4] The ozone measurements at the Bukit Atur Global Atmosphere Watch station confirm that our measurement period is typical of the long-term record at this site. [5] However, the concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) increased from 6 pptv in the boundary layer over the rainforest to 12 pptv over the plantation landscape, demonstrating enhanced photochemical processing of the increased NOx and VOC emissions and concentrations over the plantations. [1] Isoprene, ozone, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and acetylene measured between 10.00 and 16.00 hours local time at ground sites (2 left columns), from the aircraft flying within the boundary layer (500\u00e2\u20ac\u201c800 m above ground level) (2 middle columns), and from the aircraft flying in the free troposphere (3,000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6,000 m above ground level) (2 right columns). [2] The green symbols show data from the rainforest landscape, and the red symbols show data from the oil palm plantation landscape. [3] Symbol boxes show median and quartile values, with the whiskers showing 95th and 5th percentiles. [4] Measurements of NO, NO2, PAN, and acetylene were not made on the ground at the Sabahmas oil palm plantation and therefore do not appear in the figure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and acetylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the atmosphere, particularly in relation to photochemical processes. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their classification as VOCs. The focus is more on their concentrations and measurements rather than any functional or chemical relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs measured in the same atmospheric study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or significance in the context provided.",
