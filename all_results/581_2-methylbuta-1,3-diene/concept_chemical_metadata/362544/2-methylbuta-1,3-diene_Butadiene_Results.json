    "context": "[8] Specifically, our study provides an early warning of the urgent need to develop policies that manage nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere from the tropics if the detrimental effects of palm oil production on air quality and climate are to be avoided. [1] Our study comprises a truly integrated and fully comprehensive set of biosphere-to-atmosphere flux measurements, atmospheric composition measurements, and atmospheric chemistry modeling in the tropics for 2 distinct but contiguous land use types. [2] The project was based in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, during April through July 2008. [3] Our measurements (Table 1) show that emissions of VOCs from the rainforest and oil palm plantation landscapes are dominated by emissions of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). [4] On a land area basis, isoprene emissions from the plantation (27 tonnes of isoprene per km2 per year) are 5 times greater than from the rainforest. [5] Isoprene and other VOC emission rates depend, in part, on leaf temperature . [6] Temperatures were higher at the oil palm site than at the rainforest site (campaign averages 27.9 \u00c2\u00b0C and 25.7 \u00c2\u00b0C, respectively), but this difference in temperature explains only 7% of the observed difference in isoprene emission rates; the remainder is the result of the higher biogenic VOC emission rates from oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) trees  compared with rainforest tree species.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned as a significant volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from oil palm plantations, with emissions being five times greater than those from rainforest areas. Butadiene, while not directly discussed, is a related compound in the context of VOCs. The relationship between isoprene and butadiene is implied through their classification as VOCs, but no direct interaction or comparison is provided in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and butadiene, as both are VOCs, but their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed in the context.",
        "score": 2
