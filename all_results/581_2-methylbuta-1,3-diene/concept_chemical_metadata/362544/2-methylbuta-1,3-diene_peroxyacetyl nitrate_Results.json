    "context": "[3] Surprisingly, ozone concentrations were similar over both landscapes in the boundary layer (rainforest: 11 ppbv; oil palm plantation: 12 ppbv). [4] The ozone measurements at the Bukit Atur Global Atmosphere Watch station confirm that our measurement period is typical of the long-term record at this site. [5] However, the concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) increased from 6 pptv in the boundary layer over the rainforest to 12 pptv over the plantation landscape, demonstrating enhanced photochemical processing of the increased NOx and VOC emissions and concentrations over the plantations. [1] Isoprene, ozone, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, peroxyacetyl nitrate, and acetylene measured between 10.00 and 16.00 hours local time at ground sites (2 left columns), from the aircraft flying within the boundary layer (500\u00e2\u20ac\u201c800 m above ground level) (2 middle columns), and from the aircraft flying in the free troposphere (3,000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6,000 m above ground level) (2 right columns). [2] The green symbols show data from the rainforest landscape, and the red symbols show data from the oil palm plantation landscape. [3] Symbol boxes show median and quartile values, with the whiskers showing 95th and 5th percentiles. [4] Measurements of NO, NO2, PAN, and acetylene were not made on the ground at the Sabahmas oil palm plantation and therefore do not appear in the figure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is indirectly related to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) through their roles in atmospheric chemistry. The increase in PAN concentrations over the oil palm plantation is attributed to enhanced photochemical processing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This suggests that isoprene emissions contribute to the formation of PAN, although the specific interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and PAN is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is part of the VOC emissions that influence the formation of peroxyacetyl nitrate, indicating a connection in atmospheric chemistry, but lacking detailed interaction.",
