    "context": "[4] Such NOx concentrations are currently widely observed in rural areas of Western Europe , North America, and Asia . [5] Ozone at 100 ppbv has significant detrimental effects on human health and crop yields and enhances global warming through its strong radiative forcing . [1] Sensitivity of daytime (10.00\u00e2\u20ac\u201c16.00 [2] hours) average ozone concentration to concentrations of NOx in the boundary layer, for the isoprene and monoterpene emission rates measured at the rainforest and oil palm landscapes, as computed by CiTTyCAT. [3] Each model run has a similar shape but with a different point of inflection, so the solid lines are not always in the centre of the shaded region. [4] Current measured concentrations of NOx and O3 in the rainforest and plantation are marked. [1] Our measurements show that the conversion of rainforest to oil palm plantation substantially increases VOC and NOx emissions and concentrations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) related to monoterpenes, which are a class of VOCs emitted from plants. The discussion focuses on the emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes in relation to NOx concentrations and their environmental impacts, indicating that both compounds are part of the broader category of biogenic VOCs affecting air quality and climate. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes, as they are both classified as VOCs and discussed in the context of emissions. However, there is no detailed interaction or specific functional relationship provided in the context.",
