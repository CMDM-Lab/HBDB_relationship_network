    "context": "[3] Each marker represents a single measurement, and there are only a small number of instances, mostly around 5.05\u00c2\u00b0 North, 117.8\u00c2\u00b0 [4] East, where several points overlay each other. [1] Fig. 2 shows that the differences in emission rates in NOx and isoprene between the rainforest and the oil palm plantations give rise to differences in concentrations throughout the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. [2] Over the rainforest, median boundary layer mixing ratios of NO, NO2, and isoprene were 35, 161, and 767 parts per trillion (1012) by volume (pptv), respectively, and over the plantation the median mixing ratios were 67, 288, and 3870 pptv, respectively. [3] Surprisingly, ozone concentrations were similar over both landscapes in the boundary layer (rainforest: 11 ppbv; oil palm plantation: 12 ppbv). [4] The ozone measurements at the Bukit Atur Global Atmosphere Watch station confirm that our measurement period is typical of the long-term record at this site. [5] However, the concentrations of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) increased from 6 pptv in the boundary layer over the rainforest to 12 pptv over the plantation landscape, demonstrating enhanced photochemical processing of the increased NOx and VOC emissions and concentrations over the plantations.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to its emission rates over rainforest and oil palm plantations, with specific mixing ratios provided in parts per trillion (pptv). The term '1012S' appears to refer to a measurement unit (parts per trillion), indicating the concentration of isoprene in the atmosphere. However, there is no direct discussion of a relationship between isoprene and the specific measurement unit beyond this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to atmospheric measurements, but there is no detailed interaction or functional relationship discussed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the measurement unit 1012S.",
        "score": 2
