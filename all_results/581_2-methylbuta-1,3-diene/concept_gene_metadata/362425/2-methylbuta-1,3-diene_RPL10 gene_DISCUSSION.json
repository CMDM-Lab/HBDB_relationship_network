    "context": "[5] However, LOX emissions upon dehydration have been detected as early stress responses on cut grass (; ). [6] These drought treatments were, in contrast to our climate change scenarios, rather extreme and artificial and resulted in fast dehydration that normally does not occur in natural drought progression. [7] It was proposed that, under oxidative stress, a substantial fraction of isoprene is oxidized inside the leaf to MVK and/or MACR . [8] Here, we could not detect any isoprene oxidation products in measurements at the plant level (with a proton-transfer reaction-quadrupole mass spectrometer [PTR-QMS]) or at the leaf level (with a proton-transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometer [PTR-ToF-MS]). [1] While HDSs positively triggered isoprene emission rates and NEE, we observed a long-lasting impairment of plant growth and leaf pigmentation (anthocyanins and flavonols) in both IE and NE plants during HDSs and during the recovery phases. [2] The strong correlation between MeOH emission and RLER clearly demonstrates that MeOH is a suitable indicator of overall plant growth. [3] The phylogenic emission of MeOH is primarily associated with leaf expansion and cell elongation (; ; ), and developing poplar leaves emit significantly more compared with mature ones . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to plant stress responses, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of the RPL10 gene, which is typically associated with ribosomal protein synthesis. The relationship between isoprene emissions and the RPL10 gene is not established, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that while both terms are mentioned, there is no discussion or evidence of a relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the RPL10 gene in the provided context.",
