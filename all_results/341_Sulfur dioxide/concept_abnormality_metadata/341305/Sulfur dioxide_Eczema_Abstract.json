    "context": "This study investigated the dry torrefaction process only; a scrutiny of wet torrefaction is recommended for future study. The future biomass/coal co-firing life cycle study should also emphasize on the sustainability factors including socio-economic, water use, land use, soil erosion, and biodiversity. [1] For the 4,907 children who had resided at their current address for the past 3 yrs, asthma (exercise induced, past year and lifetime) was significantly positively associated with benzene, SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO. [2] In the same children, eczema (lifetime and past year) was significantly positively associated with benzene, PM10, NO2, NOx and CO, lifetime allergic rhinitis with PM10 and sensitisation to pollens with benzene and PM10. [3] Among the 2,213 children residing at their current address since birth, the associations persisted for lifetime asthma with benzene (adjusted OR per interquartile range (95% CI) 1.3 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)) and PM10 (1.4 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0)), and for sensitisation to pollens with volatile organic compounds (1.3 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)) and PM10 (1.2 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)). [1] Over the past 35 yrs, the prevalence of asthma and allergies has increased considerably worldwide, particularly in industrialised countries . [2] This phenomenon is attributable to multiple factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the air pollutants significantly associated with eczema in children. The study highlights a positive correlation between eczema and various pollutants, including SO2, indicating that exposure to this compound may contribute to the development or exacerbation of eczema symptoms. However, the context does not provide detailed mechanisms or direct evidence linking SO2 specifically to eczema beyond this association.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is associated with eczema in the study, indicating a potential link. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and the context primarily focuses on broader associations with multiple pollutants.",
