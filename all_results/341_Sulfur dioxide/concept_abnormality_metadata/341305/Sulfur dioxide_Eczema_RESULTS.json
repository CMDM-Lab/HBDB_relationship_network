    "context": "[3] Parental education, mother's ethnic origin and the four potential sources of indoor pollution at home were related to several health outcomes. [4] No significant relationship was observed with older siblings. [1] The associations between pollutants exposure and health outcomes are described in table 3. [2] An increment for an interquartile range of the concentrations of benzene, SO2, PM10, NOx and CO was associated with an increased risk for suffering from EIA. Interquartile range increases in concentrations of benzene, SO2, NOx and CO were associated with asthma in the past year; benzene, SO2, PM10 and CO with lifetime asthma; benzene, PM10, NOx and CO with past year eczema; PM10, NO2, NOx and CO with lifetime eczema; benzene and PM10 with sensitisation to pollens; and PM10 with lifetime allergic rhinitis.  [1] Sensitivity analyses repeated in the 2,834 children residing at their current address for \u00e2\u2030\u00a58 yrs resulted in similar or even higher ORs.  [2] However, the confidence intervals were slightly wider, most likely due to the smaller sample size.  [3] The associations which remained significant or for which ORs were not stable are shown in figure 2. The associations of lifetime asthma with benzene, SO2 and PM10 and of sensitisation to pollens with PM10 were particularly robust. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is associated with an increased risk of eczema, particularly in relation to lifetime asthma and other respiratory conditions. The data indicates that higher concentrations of SO2, along with other pollutants like benzene and PM10, correlate with a greater incidence of eczema among children. This suggests a potential link between SO2 exposure and the exacerbation of eczema symptoms, highlighting the impact of air quality on skin health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and eczema, supported by statistical associations in the context. The mention of SO2's correlation with eczema and asthma indicates a clear relationship, although the exact mechanisms are not detailed.",
