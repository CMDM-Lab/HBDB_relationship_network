[1] Health outcomes were classified as follows. [2] 1) Objective diagnosis during the clinical examination: EIA, defined as a decrease in peak expiratory flow after the run test >10%, and sensitisation to pollens, defined as at least one positive SPT to the tested pollens. [3] 2) Reported symptoms during the last 12 months: asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the last 1 yr. [4] 3) Reported diagnosis during life: lifetime asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema. [5] The methods used to assess the six reported outcomes through the replies to the ISAAC questions  are briefly summarised in the supplementary material. [1] Long-term exposure of the 6,683 children for whom complete health data were available (refer to the supplementary material for details on the participation rate) was assessed through 3-yr averaged (from 1998 to 2000) concentrations of major urban air pollutants (benzene, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), NO2, NOx and CO), estimated through the validated STREET 5 software (Targeting, Versailles, France), at the 108 school addresses.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed for its long-term exposure effects on children's health outcomes, including asthma. The study indicates a potential link between SO2 exposure and the prevalence of asthma symptoms, as it is included in the list of pollutants evaluated for their impact on respiratory health. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and asthma is not elaborated upon in detail within the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is identified as a pollutant potentially linked to asthma symptoms in children, but the context does not provide detailed evidence or direct interaction between SO2 and asthma beyond its inclusion in a broader health assessment.",
