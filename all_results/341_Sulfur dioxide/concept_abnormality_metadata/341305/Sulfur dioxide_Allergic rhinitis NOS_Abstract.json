    "context": "This study investigated the dry torrefaction process only; a scrutiny of wet torrefaction is recommended for future study. The future biomass/coal co-firing life cycle study should also emphasize on the sustainability factors including socio-economic, water use, land use, soil erosion, and biodiversity. [1] For the 4,907 children who had resided at their current address for the past 3 yrs, asthma (exercise induced, past year and lifetime) was significantly positively associated with benzene, SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO. [2] In the same children, eczema (lifetime and past year) was significantly positively associated with benzene, PM10, NO2, NOx and CO, lifetime allergic rhinitis with PM10 and sensitisation to pollens with benzene and PM10. [3] Among the 2,213 children residing at their current address since birth, the associations persisted for lifetime asthma with benzene (adjusted OR per interquartile range (95% CI) 1.3 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)) and PM10 (1.4 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0)), and for sensitisation to pollens with volatile organic compounds (1.3 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)) and PM10 (1.2 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)). [1] Over the past 35 yrs, the prevalence of asthma and allergies has increased considerably worldwide, particularly in industrialised countries . [2] This phenomenon is attributable to multiple factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a pollutant associated with respiratory conditions in children, including asthma and allergic rhinitis. The study indicates a significant positive association between SO2 exposure and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, suggesting that SO2 may contribute to the exacerbation of allergic responses in susceptible individuals. However, the specific relationship with allergic rhinitis NOS (not otherwise specified) is not detailed, indicating a broader connection rather than a direct one.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and allergic rhinitis, supported by evidence of associations in the study. However, the lack of specific details regarding allergic rhinitis NOS limits the strength of the relationship.",
