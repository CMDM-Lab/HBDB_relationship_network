    "context": "[3] Parental education, mother's ethnic origin and the four potential sources of indoor pollution at home were related to several health outcomes. [4] No significant relationship was observed with older siblings. [1] The associations between pollutants exposure and health outcomes are described in table 3. [2] An increment for an interquartile range of the concentrations of benzene, SO2, PM10, NOx and CO was associated with an increased risk for suffering from EIA. Interquartile range increases in concentrations of benzene, SO2, NOx and CO were associated with asthma in the past year; benzene, SO2, PM10 and CO with lifetime asthma; benzene, PM10, NOx and CO with past year eczema; PM10, NO2, NOx and CO with lifetime eczema; benzene and PM10 with sensitisation to pollens; and PM10 with lifetime allergic rhinitis.  [1] Sensitivity analyses repeated in the 2,834 children residing at their current address for \u00e2\u2030\u00a58 yrs resulted in similar or even higher ORs.  [2] However, the confidence intervals were slightly wider, most likely due to the smaller sample size.  [3] The associations which remained significant or for which ORs were not stable are shown in figure 2. The associations of lifetime asthma with benzene, SO2 and PM10 and of sensitisation to pollens with PM10 were particularly robust. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is associated with various respiratory health outcomes, including allergic rhinitis. The data indicates that increased concentrations of SO2, along with other pollutants, correlate with a heightened risk of allergic rhinitis and other respiratory conditions in children. This suggests that SO2 exposure may contribute to the development or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis symptoms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and allergic rhinitis, supported by evidence of increased risk associated with SO2 exposure. The context provides a clear link between pollutant levels and respiratory health outcomes, indicating a relevant relationship.",
