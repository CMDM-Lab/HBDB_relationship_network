[1] Health outcomes were classified as follows. [2] 1) Objective diagnosis during the clinical examination: EIA, defined as a decrease in peak expiratory flow after the run test >10%, and sensitisation to pollens, defined as at least one positive SPT to the tested pollens. [3] 2) Reported symptoms during the last 12 months: asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the last 1 yr. [4] 3) Reported diagnosis during life: lifetime asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema. [5] The methods used to assess the six reported outcomes through the replies to the ISAAC questions  are briefly summarised in the supplementary material. [1] Long-term exposure of the 6,683 children for whom complete health data were available (refer to the supplementary material for details on the participation rate) was assessed through 3-yr averaged (from 1998 to 2000) concentrations of major urban air pollutants (benzene, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), NO2, NOx and CO), estimated through the validated STREET 5 software (Targeting, Versailles, France), at the 108 school addresses.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed for its long-term exposure effects on children's health outcomes, including eczema. While the study indicates a correlation between air pollution and various allergic conditions, including eczema, it does not provide specific evidence or detailed analysis of the direct relationship between SO2 exposure and the incidence or severity of eczema symptoms in the children studied.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is included in the assessment of air pollutants related to health outcomes, including eczema. However, the context lacks specific details on how SO2 directly affects eczema, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
