    "context": "The future biomass/coal co-firing life cycle study should also emphasize on the sustainability factors including socio-economic, water use, land use, soil erosion, and biodiversity. [1] For the 4,907 children who had resided at their current address for the past 3 yrs, asthma (exercise induced, past year and lifetime) was significantly positively associated with benzene, SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and CO. [2] In the same children, eczema (lifetime and past year) was significantly positively associated with benzene, PM10, NO2, NOx and CO, lifetime allergic rhinitis with PM10 and sensitisation to pollens with benzene and PM10. [3] Among the 2,213 children residing at their current address since birth, the associations persisted for lifetime asthma with benzene (adjusted OR per interquartile range (95% CI) 1.3 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)) and PM10 (1.4 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0)), and for sensitisation to pollens with volatile organic compounds (1.3 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)) and PM10 (1.2 (1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1.9)). [1] Over the past 35 yrs, the prevalence of asthma and allergies has increased considerably worldwide, particularly in industrialised countries . [2] This phenomenon is attributable to multiple factors. [3] Air pollution has also considerably changed over the last decades. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a significant air pollutant positively associated with asthma in children. The study highlights that children exposed to SO2, along with other pollutants like benzene and PM10, exhibited higher rates of asthma, indicating a potential link between SO2 exposure and respiratory health issues. This suggests that SO2 may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms or the development of asthma in susceptible populations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between sulfur dioxide and asthma, supported by statistical associations in the study. The evidence indicates that SO2 exposure is linked to increased asthma prevalence, although the exact mechanisms of this relationship are not fully explored.",
