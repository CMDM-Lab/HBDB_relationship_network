    "context": "The constant rate of O3 accumulation, from morning to its peak concentration, found by Fujita et al. (2003) does not seem applicable to our data, which exhibit two rather distinct phases of O3 accumulation to their respective maxima in the two cities (Fig. 2): (a) a fast-phase (from points B and C to point D), suggesting a high rate of ozone accumulation and (b) a slow-phase (from point D to points F and E for Volos and Patras, respectively), suggesting a low rate of ozone accumulation. The duration of each phase is different in the two cities and seems to depend on the type of the local photochemistry. Probably, the approach of Fujita et al., could be applicable to places where ozone accumulation curve exhibits a bell-shaped pattern with a clear peak, to which ozone accumulation reaches almost linearly its maximum, as described in their article, but it is rather inappropriate for places, like those in Patras and Volos, where ozone diurnal pattern exhibits a plateau.Weekday/weekend variations Although, weekly changes in the emissions caused by human activities are known to affect the weekly cycle of ambient pollutant concentrations, this emission\u2013concentration relationship, in urban, suburban and rural sites, is not well elucidated and that is reflected in controversial reports (Blier and Winer, 1999; Pun et al., 2003). Weekday/weekend differences in ambient concentrations of air pollutants such as NO x , CO, SO2 and especially of O3 have been a subject of research interest (Marr and Harley, 2002; Vandaele et al., 2002; Fujita et al., 2003). During weekends, the emissions of anthropogenic pollutants and especially of O3 precursors, are believed to be lower compared to those occurring during weekdays, because car traffic is lower and several polluting plants and factories may be less active or inactive during weekends. Several approaches have been used for the study of the so-called weekend effect, meaning the occurrence of increased O3 levels and decreased NO x during weekends in comparison to midweek days. Near constant day-of-week O3 levels, in the face of strong weekday/weekend variations in NO x , should also be viewed as a weekend effect (Fujita et al., 2003). ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the air pollutants studied in relation to weekday/weekend variations in ambient concentrations. The reference to Harley pertains to research on the emissions and concentrations of pollutants, including SO2, but there is no direct relationship or interaction discussed between sulfur dioxide and Harley. They are connected through the broader topic of air quality research, but not specifically to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and Harley are involved in the study of air pollution, but their relationship lacks detailed discussion or specific interaction in the context provided.",
