    "context": "While air pollution can exacerbate asthma (Guarnieri and Balmes, 2014), only one prior study examined the interaction of asthma and air pollutants, looking exclusively at first trimester exposure to NOx and O3. Olsson et al. (2013). This Swedish register-based study found no relation between preeclampsia and NOx and no significant interactions for O3 and asthma in the risk for preeclampsia. Our aim was to examine whether the relationships between preeclampsia and criteria air pollutant exposures as well as exposure to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were different among women with and without asthma, for exposures preconception and throughout pregnancy, in a large contemporary U.S. obstetric cohort. Study population Our study is based on a retrospective cohort of 228,438 births at \u226523 weeks gestation assembled using hospital delivery admission electronic medical records (both mother and neonate charts) from 12 centers (19 hospitals; 15 hospital referral regions) across the United States (Zhang et al., 2010). We excluded multifetal pregnancies (n=5053), pregnancies missing air quality data (n=10) or maternal age (n=307), women with chronic hypertension (n=4358) and superimposed preeclampsia (n=1889) because they were not at risk for new-onset hypertension. We also excluded women with gestational hypertension (n=6074) or eclampsia (n=239) to allow comparison of preeclampsia cases to a normotensive reference group. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to air pollution and its potential exacerbation of asthma symptoms. While the study primarily focuses on the relationship between various air pollutants and preeclampsia, it acknowledges that air pollution can worsen asthma. However, there is no direct examination of sulfur dioxide's specific effects on asthma within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is associated with air pollution, which is known to exacerbate asthma. However, the context does not provide detailed evidence or specific interactions between sulfur dioxide and asthma, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
        "score": 2
