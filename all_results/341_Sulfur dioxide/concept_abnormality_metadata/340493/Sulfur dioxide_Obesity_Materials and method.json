    "context": "The specific gestational age at preeclampsia diagnosis was not available, but severity of preeclampsia was distinguished using ICD-9 codes (642.4: mild or unspecified preeclampsia; 642.5: severe preeclampsia). Asthma diagnosis was recorded in the medical record and/or in the discharge summary (ICD-9 code 493.0-493.9). Maternal age (continuous), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, Other/Unknown), pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) category (underweight <18.5, normal weight 18.5 to <25, overweight 25 to <30, obese \u226530, unknown), parity (nulliparous, primiparous, multiparous), marital status (married, divorced/widowed, single, unknown), insurance status (public, private, other, unknown), smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy (both yes/no) were all derived from the electronic medical record.Exposure We estimated air pollutant exposures, both for criteria pollutants and hazardous air toxics, using a modified version of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, which is based on a three-dimensional, regional air quality model developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). The model inputs weather data including hourly measures of temperature, relative humidity and wind characteristics as well as air pollutant emissions generated using the U.S. EPA National Emission Inventories. Hourly exposures were calculated over the entire continental U.S. for the years 2001\u20132010 in the Air Quality and Reproductive Health study which was completed in 2013 and described in detail elsewhere (Chen et al., 2014). Briefly, model estimates for criteria air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, O3, NOx, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and CO were fused with monitor data from the US EPA Air Quality System to correct for measurement errors using inverse distance weighting to take advantage of measured data where they were available.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as part of a broader study on air pollutant exposures, but there is no direct discussion linking SO2 to obesity. The focus is primarily on maternal health factors and air quality modeling, without establishing a clear relationship between SO2 exposure and obesity outcomes. Thus, while both terms are present, their connection is not explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between sulfur dioxide and obesity in the provided context. They are mentioned in the same study, but there is no discussion or evidence connecting the two.",
