    "context": "Naphthalene increased risk for asthmatics in the second trimester and whole pregnancy (21%) and whole pregnancy pyrene increased preeclampsia risk for non-asthmatics (7%). Analyses restricted to nulliparous women, as well as those restricted by pre-pregnancy BMI status to normal weight only and obese women only, generally yielded similar results as the main analyses although with a loss of precision due to the smaller sample. Restriction to severe preeclampsia cases attenuated the results and several inverse associations were observed (data not shown). We found first trimester exposure to NOx and SO2 and whole pregnancy elemental carbon were associated with higher risks of preeclampsia among asthmatic women compared to their non-asthmatic counterparts. SO2 has not been previously studied in relation to preeclampsia alone, so our findings for this pollutant are novel. Most notably, nearly all the VOCs we studied were associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, with significantly higher risk in pregnancies complicated by maternal asthma. In our data, modeled VOC exposure among asthmatics was associated with increased preeclampsia risk up to 70%. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is linked to asthma through its association with increased risks of preeclampsia in asthmatic women. The study indicates that first trimester exposure to SO2, along with other pollutants, correlates with higher preeclampsia risks among asthmatic women compared to non-asthmatics. This suggests that SO2 exposure may exacerbate health risks in individuals with asthma during pregnancy, highlighting its potential impact on respiratory health and pregnancy outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and asthma, as the study provides evidence of SO2 exposure being associated with increased preeclampsia risk specifically in asthmatic women, indicating a clear relationship within the context of respiratory health.",
        "score": 4
