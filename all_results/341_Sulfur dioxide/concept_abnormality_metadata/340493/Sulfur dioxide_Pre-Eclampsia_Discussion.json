    "context": "Analyses restricted to nulliparous women, as well as those restricted by pre-pregnancy BMI status to normal weight only and obese women only, generally yielded similar results as the main analyses although with a loss of precision due to the smaller sample. Restriction to severe preeclampsia cases attenuated the results and several inverse associations were observed (data not shown). We found first trimester exposure to NOx and SO2 and whole pregnancy elemental carbon were associated with higher risks of preeclampsia among asthmatic women compared to their non-asthmatic counterparts. SO2 has not been previously studied in relation to preeclampsia alone, so our findings for this pollutant are novel. Most notably, nearly all the VOCs we studied were associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, with significantly higher risk in pregnancies complicated by maternal asthma. In our data, modeled VOC exposure among asthmatics was associated with increased preeclampsia risk up to 70%. In contrast, with the exception of naphthalene and fluoranthene, PAH exposures rarely interacted with maternal asthma in relation to preeclampsia risk, but some PAHs were associated with elevated risk in both groups.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure during the first trimester is associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, particularly among asthmatic women. This finding is novel, as SO2 has not been previously studied in relation to pre-eclampsia alone. The study indicates that air pollutants, including SO2, may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, highlighting the importance of environmental factors in maternal health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and pre-eclampsia, supported by evidence of increased risk associated with SO2 exposure in asthmatic women. The novel nature of this finding adds to its relevance, although further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved.",
