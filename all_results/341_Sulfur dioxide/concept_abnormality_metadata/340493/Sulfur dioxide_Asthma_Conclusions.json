    "context": "This is the first study to comprehensively study the interaction of maternal asthma, a common chronic disease in contemporary obstetric practice known to increase preeclampsia risk, and air pollutant exposures. We find many exposures that differentially increase preeclampsia risk for women with asthma, suggesting they are a particularly vulnerable population. Consistent with a recent meta-analysis of preeclampsia, we found no effect for most criteria air pollutants on preeclampsia risk with the exception of a 10% increased risk among asthmatics associated with second trimester CO exposure. We also observed few interactions with maternal asthma for the commonly measured criteria air pollutants with the exception of first trimester NOx and SO2. In contrast, we see a strong signal for most VOC exposures, particularly for women with asthma. These results merit further investigation and suggest that women with asthma, who already experience higher rates of preeclampsia, may be a vulnerable subpopulation with respect to air pollution exposure.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the air pollutants studied for its interaction with maternal asthma and its potential impact on preeclampsia risk. The findings suggest that women with asthma may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution, including SO2 exposure, although the specific relationship between SO2 and asthma is not deeply explored. The study indicates that while most criteria air pollutants showed no significant effect on preeclampsia risk, SO2 and NOx were noted for their interactions with maternal asthma, warranting further investigation.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is linked to asthma in the context of air pollution exposure and its potential effects on preeclampsia risk. However, the relationship is not extensively detailed, indicating a need for more focused research.",
        "score": 3
