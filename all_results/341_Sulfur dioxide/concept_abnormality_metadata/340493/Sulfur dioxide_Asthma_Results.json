    "context": "Risks were significantly elevated 11% for asthmatics in association with whole pregnancy elemental carbon exposure and 10% for second trimester CO exposure. Among non-asthmatics, significant risk reductions were observed for first trimester NOx and SO2 exposure, with elevated risks associated with elemental carbon and organic compounds in the second trimester, sulfite particles in the first trimester and whole pregnancy dust particles. The interaction of VOCs and asthma ( Table 3) reveals a fairly consistent pattern of increased risk for asthmatics (6\u201370%) with significant interactions observed for most of the compounds studied in multiple windows. Significantly increased risks (13\u201370%) for asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics were seen in every time window studied for benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene. Risk estimates tended to be higher for whole pregnancy average exposures for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. No interaction was observed for methyl-tertiary butyl ether, sesquiterpene or styrene. Preeclampsia risk estimates were elevated for both asthmatics (39%) and non-asthmatics (15%) in relation to second trimester benzene exposure and whole pregnancy exposure increased risk for asthmatics only.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure is associated with increased risks for asthmatics during pregnancy. The study indicates that asthmatics face significantly elevated risks (10%) related to SO2 exposure, particularly in the context of other pollutants. This suggests a potential exacerbation of asthma symptoms or complications due to SO2, highlighting its relevance in respiratory health during pregnancy.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and asthma, as the context provides evidence of increased risk for asthmatics associated with SO2 exposure. The data indicates a clear relationship, although it does not delve deeply into the mechanisms of this interaction.",
        "score": 4
