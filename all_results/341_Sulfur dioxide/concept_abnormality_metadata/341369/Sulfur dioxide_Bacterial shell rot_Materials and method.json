    "context": "Production of hydrogen sulphide (H2S): the qualitative characterization of the yeasts for the character \u201cproduction of H2S\u201d was performed on BIGGY agar medium. The production of H2S was evaluated in function of yeast streak browning. After 24h at 26\u00b0C, fresh yeast cells streaked on this medium assume different browning degree in function of their capacity to produce H2S. The following codes were used: S, Snow; W, White; H, Hazelnut; B, Brown; R, Rust; C, Coffee (S=lowest production level of H2S; C=highest production level of H2S). In grape must fermentations, all S. cerevisiae strains chosen in this study were characterized by a general good fermentation performance, reaching very similar levels of CO2 evolution and sugar exhaustion (the residual sugars ranged from 1 to 1.5%). All the strains exhibited a high fermentation power, producing about 18g CO2/100ml of grape must.Analysis of volatile compounds by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) The first step of this work was to optimize the condition for extraction of aromatic compounds of experimental wines obtained by inoculating the 36 S. cerevisiae strains. Optimal condition of extraction was obtained using the following procedure: 20ml of wine were transferred to a 25ml vial. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned in relation to bacterial shell rot. The focus is on the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by yeast strains during fermentation, which may have implications for spoilage or off-flavors in wine. However, there is no explicit connection made between sulfur dioxide and bacterial shell rot, which typically refers to a disease affecting fruits or vegetables caused by bacteria. Thus, the relationship remains unclear and indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is related to fermentation processes where H2S is produced, but there is no detailed discussion of its impact on bacterial shell rot or any direct relevance between the two terms.",
