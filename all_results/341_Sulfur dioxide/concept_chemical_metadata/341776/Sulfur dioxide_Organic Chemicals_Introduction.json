    "context": "It is also suggested that for O3, the 8-h standard is more stringent than the 1-h standard, while for NO2 and SO2, the 1-h standard is more stringent than the 24-h standard. The multiple regression analyses confirmed that meteorological parameters are important for roadside pollution levels as well as residential pollution levels. Since the pollution prevention concept emerged many years ago, there has been a growing concern about air quality in urban areas. To improve urban air quality, environmental policy makers express widespread interest in controlling and regulating major gaseous pollutants such as O3, CO, NO, NO2, SO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Increased levels of these pollutants, besides eroding materials, are known to have deleterious effects on human health (Brunekreef and Holgate, 2002), to cause injury to plants (Saitanis et al., 2001; Saitanis and Karandinos, 2002), to reduce crops yield (Nali et al., 2002) and to affect negatively ecosystems (Garrec and Kerfoun, 1989; Bytnerowicz et al., 2002). Concerning plants, it is known that urban trees, bushes and other ornamental plants as well as forests, woodlands, other natural ecosystems and agricultural land, adjacent to urban areas, are exposed increasingly to air pollutants of urban origin. Air pollutants, particularly SO2, NO2 and the major secondary photochemical oxidant O3 are important threats to plants. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a major gaseous pollutant that contributes to urban air quality issues, alongside other organic chemicals such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The discussion highlights the harmful effects of SO2 on human health, plants, and ecosystems, indicating its relevance as an organic chemical pollutant in urban environments. However, the relationship is more about SO2 being categorized as a harmful pollutant rather than a direct interaction with organic chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is discussed in the context of air pollution alongside organic chemicals, indicating a shared significance in environmental health. However, there is no detailed interaction or specific relationship between SO2 and organic chemicals beyond their classification as pollutants.",
