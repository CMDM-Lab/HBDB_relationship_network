    "context": "For certain pollutants, urban air quality has been improved significantly, in many places of Europe, over the last two decades. However, it is estimated that in 2010 the European urban population will still be exposed regularly to high concentrations of air pollutants (EEA, 2003a). The number and the types of reactions involved in the air pollutants formation are too many and have kept researchers occupied for many years. The oxidation of SO2 and NO2 and their conversion to particulate sulfate ( SO 4 2 - ) and (gaseous and particulate) nitrates (NO3) are important characteristics of urban air photochemistry (Monn and Shaeppi, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1998). Moreover, the rate of the conversion of NO x to NO3 affects ozone formation and fate of the NO x in the atmosphere. NO x are oxidized to nitric acid (HNO3) in the atmosphere, which in turn forms the NO3 particles (Matsumoto and Tanaka, 1996). The environmental effects of these secondary pollutants are associated with acidification of precipitation, visibility reduction and deleterious effects on human health and plants\u2019 vigor, enhancing the negative effects of primary pollutants.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation and conversion into particulate sulfates (SO4^2-) as part of urban air photochemistry. This process is significant for understanding the formation of secondary pollutants, which include inorganic sulfates. The relationship highlights how SO2 contributes to sulfate formation, impacting air quality and environmental health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and inorganic sulfates, as the context discusses the conversion of SO2 into sulfates, indicating a clear chemical relationship with implications for air quality and health.",
        "score": 4
