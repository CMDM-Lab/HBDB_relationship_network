    "context": "In particular, total carbonyl compounds ranged from 0.1% to 1.3% and from 0.1% to 0.4% in wine samples produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d strains, respectively (Table 1). Acetaldehyde was produced by 35% of \u201cSouthern\u201d and 25% of \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Fig.\u00a01). Decanal was formed by 45% of \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts, while \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts didn't form this compound. As regards ketones, 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone were recovered in 45% and in 35% of wine samples produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d Italy strains, respectively, and in 37.5% and in 25% of wine samples obtained with \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). Other aromatic compounds were determined in low amounts both in wines produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Table 1). In summary, S. cerevisiae isolated from Southern Italy grapes were able to produce more volatile compounds than those from Northern Italy. Consequently, yeasts from South Italy can produce potentially more complex wines from a specific must. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to 2-heptanone. The focus is on the production of various carbonyl compounds, including 2-heptanone, by different strains of S. cerevisiae in wine fermentation. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used as a preservative in winemaking, its specific interaction with 2-heptanone or its role in the fermentation process is not discussed, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that sulfur dioxide and 2-heptanone are mentioned in the same context of winemaking, but there is no discussion of their relationship or interaction. They appear coincidentally without any direct relevance.",
