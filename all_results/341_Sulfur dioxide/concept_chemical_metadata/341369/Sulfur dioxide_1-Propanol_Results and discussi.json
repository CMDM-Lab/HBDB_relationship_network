    "context": "Among higher alcohols determined, all the strains produced 3-methyl-1-butanol (Fig.\u00a01 ), that is the major higher alcohol in wine (Romano et\u00a0al., 2003; Garde-Cerd\u00e1n and Anc\u00edn-Azpilicueta, 2007). 2-Methyl-1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol were recovered in numerous experimental wines; in particular, about 65% of the wines produced by fermentation with \u201cSouthern\u201d strains were characterized by the presence of these three higher alcohols, whereas only 30% of wines produced by \u201cNorthern\u201d strains contained these compounds. Two wines, samples 9 and 10, produced by fermentation with two different S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d strains, didn't contain these compounds. 1-Propanol was detected in 15 of 20 wines fermented with S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d strains, while only 6 of 16 wines produced by \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts contained this compound (Fig.\u00a01). The content of this higher alcohol in wine is mainly influenced by the starter strain responsible for the fermentation (Giudici et\u00a0al., 1993; Torrea et\u00a0al., 2003). The content of other alcohols was variable in all the wine samples without correlation with the strain origin. As regards acid content of the experimental wines, these compounds were not recovered only in five wines (samples 3, 6, 10, 15, and 18) obtained by fermentation with \u201cSouthern\u201d strains and were not determined in all the experimental wines derived by fermentation with \u201cNorthern\u201d strains.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to 1-propanol. The focus is on the production of various higher alcohols, including 1-propanol, during the fermentation of wines by different strains of S. cerevisiae. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking as a preservative and antioxidant, its specific interaction with 1-propanol or its influence on its production is not discussed in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between sulfur dioxide and 1-propanol in the context. They are mentioned in the same document, but there is no discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
