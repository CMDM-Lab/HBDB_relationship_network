    "context": "Other esters, such as ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate were found in 75%, 85% and 85%, respectively, of wines fermented by Southern Italy yeasts and in 87.5%, 87.5%, and 68.75%, respectively, of wines resulting by fermentation with Northern Italy yeasts (Fig.\u00a01). Ethyl nonanoate was found in 55% samples obtained by 11 of 20 S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d strains and only in 12.5% samples produced by 2 of 16 Northern strains. Ethyl acetate was detected only in a few samples obtained with S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d strains and only in sample 1 obtained with a \u201cNorthern\u201d yeast (Table 1). These S. cerevisiae strains did not produce probably very aromatic wines as ethyl acetate does not evolve fruity and floral odours, contrary to ethyl esters of fatty acids and acetate ester of higher alcohols (Lema et\u00a0al., 1996). The relative amounts of total carbonyl compounds found in the experimental wines produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts were lower than the amounts determined in wines obtained by \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts. In particular, total carbonyl compounds ranged from 0.1% to 1.3% and from 0.1% to 0.4% in wine samples produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d strains, respectively (Table 1). Acetaldehyde was produced by 35% of \u201cSouthern\u201d and 25% of \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Fig.\u00a01). ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to esters, which are discussed in the context of wine fermentation by different yeast strains. The focus is on the production of various esters, such as ethyl octanoate and ethyl acetate, and their presence in wines from Southern and Northern Italy. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking for preservation and preventing spoilage, its specific interaction with esters in this context is not addressed, indicating a lack of direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that sulfur dioxide and esters are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion of their relationship or interaction. They appear coincidentally without any direct relevance.",
