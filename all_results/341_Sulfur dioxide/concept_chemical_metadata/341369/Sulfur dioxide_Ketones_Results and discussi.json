    "context": "In particular, total carbonyl compounds ranged from 0.1% to 1.3% and from 0.1% to 0.4% in wine samples produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d strains, respectively (Table 1). Acetaldehyde was produced by 35% of \u201cSouthern\u201d and 25% of \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Fig.\u00a01). Decanal was formed by 45% of \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts, while \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts didn't form this compound. As regards ketones, 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone were recovered in 45% and in 35% of wine samples produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d Italy strains, respectively, and in 37.5% and in 25% of wine samples obtained with \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). Other aromatic compounds were determined in low amounts both in wines produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Table 1). In summary, S. cerevisiae isolated from Southern Italy grapes were able to produce more volatile compounds than those from Northern Italy. Consequently, yeasts from South Italy can produce potentially more complex wines from a specific must. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to ketones, which are identified as volatile compounds produced by different strains of S. cerevisiae in wine fermentation. The focus is on the production of ketones like 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone by these yeast strains, with no discussion of sulfur dioxide's role or interaction with ketones in the winemaking process. Therefore, while both terms are related to wine production, their connection is not explicitly established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and ketones are relevant to the context of wine production, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
