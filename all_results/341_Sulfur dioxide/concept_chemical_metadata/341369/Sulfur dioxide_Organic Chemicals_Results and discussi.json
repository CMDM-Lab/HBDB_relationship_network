    "context": "At this purpose we used both different exposition times of the fiber to the headspace and different temperatures. Furthermore, the analytical conditions (column, oven temperature, temperature raising rate) were selected in order to obtain the best resolution of the peaks. The vial was sealed and headspace extraction was performed for 20min at 25\u00b0C with a 100\u03bcm PDMS fiber, keeping the sample under continuous stirring. By this analysis, the experimental wines yielded different levels of the relative peak areas related to the volatile organic compounds (VOC), in function of the different S. cerevisiae strain which performed the fermentation process. In Table 1 , the compounds with area % less than 0.1 were not reported. In particular, by examining the data for each strain, it was found a considerable variability in relative amounts of total alcohols, which ranged from 34.5% to 83.8%. No significant differences for this parameter were found among the experimental wines produced by S. cerevisiae Southern and Northern strains. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to organic chemicals as it is often used as a preservative in wine production, which involves the fermentation of organic compounds by S. cerevisiae. The analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the wines produced by different yeast strains suggests that SO2 may influence the composition and relative amounts of these organic chemicals, although the specific interactions are not detailed in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals, as they are both involved in the context of wine production. However, the relationship lacks detailed discussion or evidence of direct interaction.",
