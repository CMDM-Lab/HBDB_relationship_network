    "context": "Acetaldehyde was produced by 35% of \u201cSouthern\u201d and 25% of \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Fig.\u00a01). Decanal was formed by 45% of \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts, while \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts didn't form this compound. As regards ketones, 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone were recovered in 45% and in 35% of wine samples produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d Italy strains, respectively, and in 37.5% and in 25% of wine samples obtained with \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). Other aromatic compounds were determined in low amounts both in wines produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Table 1). In summary, S. cerevisiae isolated from Southern Italy grapes were able to produce more volatile compounds than those from Northern Italy. Consequently, yeasts from South Italy can produce potentially more complex wines from a specific must. During fermentation all yeasts produced ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned, but aromatic compounds are discussed in relation to the fermentation process of yeasts from Southern and Northern Italy. The production of various volatile compounds, including aromatic ones, is influenced by the yeast strains used. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking to preserve and enhance aromatic qualities, its specific role in this context is not detailed, leading to an indirect connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect relationship, as sulfur dioxide is typically associated with the preservation of aromatic compounds in winemaking, but it is not explicitly discussed in relation to the aromatic compounds produced by the yeasts in this context.",
        "score": 2
