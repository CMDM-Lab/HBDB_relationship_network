    "context": "Ethyl acetate was detected only in a few samples obtained with S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d strains and only in sample 1 obtained with a \u201cNorthern\u201d yeast (Table 1). These S. cerevisiae strains did not produce probably very aromatic wines as ethyl acetate does not evolve fruity and floral odours, contrary to ethyl esters of fatty acids and acetate ester of higher alcohols (Lema et\u00a0al., 1996). The relative amounts of total carbonyl compounds found in the experimental wines produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts were lower than the amounts determined in wines obtained by \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts. In particular, total carbonyl compounds ranged from 0.1% to 1.3% and from 0.1% to 0.4% in wine samples produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d strains, respectively (Table 1). Acetaldehyde was produced by 35% of \u201cSouthern\u201d and 25% of \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Fig.\u00a01). Decanal was formed by 45% of \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts, while \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts didn't form this compound. As regards ketones, 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone were recovered in 45% and in 35% of wine samples produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d Italy strains, respectively, and in 37.5% and in 25% of wine samples obtained with \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts, respectively (Fig.\u00a01).

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned, but carbonyl compounds, including acetaldehyde and ketones, are discussed in relation to the production of wines by different S. cerevisiae strains. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking for its preservative and antioxidant properties, the relationship with carbonyl compounds is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, indicating a lack of direct interaction or relevance between the two terms in this specific context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is a common additive in winemaking, which may influence the formation of carbonyl compounds, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship in the context provided.",
