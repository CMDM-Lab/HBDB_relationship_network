    "context": "The productivity, fuel consumption rate, and lifetime of the spreader was estimated to be 4.4ha/h, 5L/h, and 1200h, respectively (Mann and Spath, 1997). Truck use in the transportation of ash and plant materials for landfilling was assumed to be similar to that for biomass transportation and relevant inventory data are presented in Table 3. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions impact The life cycle GHG emission impacts of the direct co-firing pathways are shown in Fig. 2 . The GHG emissions (Fig. 2) do not include the impacts of coal and only environmental impacts for 1MWh of biomass-based power generation for all the pathways are shown. From the GHG emission perspective, AR-based power generation is the most favorable option of biomass-based power generation followed by power generation from FR and WT, irrespective of the densification technology (Fig. 2). This outcome is mainly because AR is considered a by-product in the base case and AR is available at a much lower moisture content (14wt.%) compared to FR (45wt.%) ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and coal are indirectly related through the discussion of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts of biomass-based power generation. While coal is mentioned as a fuel source, the focus is on the emissions from biomass power generation, with no direct connection established between sulfur dioxide and coal's combustion or its specific emissions profile. Thus, their relationship is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as sulfur dioxide and coal are mentioned in the same context regarding emissions, but there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship. They share a general category of environmental impact but lack detailed connection.",
