    "context": "Net GHG, ARP, and GOP emissions for each power generation pathway were determined based on Eq. (2) (2) Net emission = \u03a3 \u03b5 out where \u03a3\u03b5out =life cycle GHG/ARP/GOP emissions corresponding to the FU. A detailed description of the methodology for evaluating the life cycle NER and environmental emissions has been provided previously (Kabir and Kumar, 2011). It was assumed that coal-fired power plants in Alberta operate with an efficiency of 35% (Kabir and Kumar, 2011). Environmental stressors considered in this study were greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, CO, CH4, and N2O), acid rain precursors (ARP: SO2 and NO x ), and ground level ozone precursors (GOP: NO x and VOC). Weighting factors for the different emission compounds were adopted from Kabir and Kumar (2011). Since biomass absorbs CO2 during growth, biomass combustion during co-firing was considered as CO2 neutral; however, other GHG, ARP, and GOP emissions during biomass combustion were included. Energy and environmental performances of each biomass co-firing pathway were compared with those of coal-fired power plant to understand its extent of benefits. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) are both mentioned as environmental stressors related to emissions from power generation pathways. Sulfur dioxide is identified as a precursor to acid rain, while ozone is noted as a ground-level ozone precursor. However, the relationship between the two is not explicitly discussed, and they are presented more as components of broader environmental emissions rather than having a direct interaction or impact on each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and ozone are categorized as environmental stressors in the context of emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other.",
        "score": 2
