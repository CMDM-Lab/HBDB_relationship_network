    "context": "Energy and environmental impacts of truck manufacturing, operation (empty/loaded), recycling, and disposal were taken into account. The impacts from the primary road construction (required for biomass collection) were considered in UP 2. The impacts of road construction were disregarded in UP 4 since it was assumed that the biomass feedstocks would be transported to the power plant from biomass preprocessing plants using the existing road network. Table 3 provides the specifications of the truck used in feedstock transportation to the end user. Methodologies to calculate the actual load carrying capacity and fuel consumption by truck are described in Section 3.2.Power production (UP 5) During direct co-firing, biomass and coal are simultaneously fed into the same boiler. Direct co-firing involves blending of biomass and coal followed by processing of the mixture through coal mills, crushers, pulverizer, and burner. However, this technique can be modified for feedstock in the form of pellet and TOP. Feedstock in these forms is mixed with coal after coal milling since it can be crushed evenly and mixed with the milled coal (Maciejewska et al., 2006). ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to coal through the process of direct co-firing, where biomass and coal are burned together in the same boiler. The combustion of coal is known to produce sulfur dioxide as a byproduct, which has significant environmental and health impacts. The mention of coal in the context of biomass co-firing implies a consideration of sulfur dioxide emissions resulting from this energy production method, although the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and coal is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is a known byproduct of coal combustion, and the context discusses coal's role in energy production. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, limiting the strength of the connection.",
