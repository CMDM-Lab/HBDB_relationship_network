    "context": "Smoking was less common in pregnancies with preeclampsia for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. We observed significant interactions for NOx and SO2 in the first trimester and for elemental carbon in the whole pregnancy average, with higher risk estimates among asthmatics ( Table 2). Risks were significantly elevated 11% for asthmatics in association with whole pregnancy elemental carbon exposure and 10% for second trimester CO exposure. Among non-asthmatics, significant risk reductions were observed for first trimester NOx and SO2 exposure, with elevated risks associated with elemental carbon and organic compounds in the second trimester, sulfite particles in the first trimester and whole pregnancy dust particles. The interaction of VOCs and asthma ( Table 3) reveals a fairly consistent pattern of increased risk for asthmatics (6\u201370%) with significant interactions observed for most of the compounds studied in multiple windows. Significantly increased risks (13\u201370%) for asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics were seen in every time window studied for benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene. Risk estimates tended to be higher for whole pregnancy average exposures for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a pollutant whose exposure is analyzed in relation to pregnancy outcomes, particularly in asthmatic and non-asthmatic women. The term 'elements' likely refers to elemental carbon and other elemental pollutants discussed in the study. While SO2 is part of the broader discussion on air quality and its health impacts, the specific relationship between SO2 and the broader category of elements is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is part of the discussion on air pollutants, which includes elemental carbon. However, there is no detailed exploration of how SO2 specifically interacts with or relates to the broader category of elements.",
