    "context": "Smoking was less common in pregnancies with preeclampsia for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. We observed significant interactions for NOx and SO2 in the first trimester and for elemental carbon in the whole pregnancy average, with higher risk estimates among asthmatics ( Table 2). Risks were significantly elevated 11% for asthmatics in association with whole pregnancy elemental carbon exposure and 10% for second trimester CO exposure. Among non-asthmatics, significant risk reductions were observed for first trimester NOx and SO2 exposure, with elevated risks associated with elemental carbon and organic compounds in the second trimester, sulfite particles in the first trimester and whole pregnancy dust particles. The interaction of VOCs and asthma ( Table 3) reveals a fairly consistent pattern of increased risk for asthmatics (6\u201370%) with significant interactions observed for most of the compounds studied in multiple windows. Significantly increased risks (13\u201370%) for asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics were seen in every time window studied for benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene. Risk estimates tended to be higher for whole pregnancy average exposures for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned alongside organic chemicals as part of a study examining the risks associated with exposure to various pollutants during pregnancy, particularly in asthmatic and non-asthmatic women. The interactions between SO2 and organic compounds, such as elemental carbon and VOCs, indicate a potential link to elevated health risks, particularly for asthmatics. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and organic chemicals is not deeply explored beyond their association with risk estimates in the context of air pollution exposure during pregnancy.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals are discussed in relation to health risks during pregnancy, particularly for asthmatics. While they are connected through the context of air pollution, the specific interactions between SO2 and organic chemicals are not elaborated upon.",
