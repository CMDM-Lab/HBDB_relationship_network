    "context": "Naphthalene increased risk for asthmatics in the second trimester and whole pregnancy (21%) and whole pregnancy pyrene increased preeclampsia risk for non-asthmatics (7%). Analyses restricted to nulliparous women, as well as those restricted by pre-pregnancy BMI status to normal weight only and obese women only, generally yielded similar results as the main analyses although with a loss of precision due to the smaller sample. Restriction to severe preeclampsia cases attenuated the results and several inverse associations were observed (data not shown). We found first trimester exposure to NOx and SO2 and whole pregnancy elemental carbon were associated with higher risks of preeclampsia among asthmatic women compared to their non-asthmatic counterparts. SO2 has not been previously studied in relation to preeclampsia alone, so our findings for this pollutant are novel. Most notably, nearly all the VOCs we studied were associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, with significantly higher risk in pregnancies complicated by maternal asthma. In our data, modeled VOC exposure among asthmatics was associated with increased preeclampsia risk up to 70%. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon are both mentioned as pollutants associated with increased risks of preeclampsia among asthmatic women. The study highlights that first trimester exposure to NOx and SO2, along with whole pregnancy exposure to elemental carbon, correlates with higher preeclampsia risks. While SO2 is noted for its novel association with preeclampsia, carbon is included as part of the broader analysis of elemental pollutants, indicating a potential link to adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in women with asthma.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and carbon, as both are pollutants linked to increased preeclampsia risk in the study. The context provides evidence of their association with adverse health outcomes, particularly in asthmatic women, indicating a clear relationship.",
        "score": 4
