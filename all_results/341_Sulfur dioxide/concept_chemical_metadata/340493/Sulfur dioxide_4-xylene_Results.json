    "context": "Risks were significantly elevated 11% for asthmatics in association with whole pregnancy elemental carbon exposure and 10% for second trimester CO exposure. Among non-asthmatics, significant risk reductions were observed for first trimester NOx and SO2 exposure, with elevated risks associated with elemental carbon and organic compounds in the second trimester, sulfite particles in the first trimester and whole pregnancy dust particles. The interaction of VOCs and asthma ( Table 3) reveals a fairly consistent pattern of increased risk for asthmatics (6\u201370%) with significant interactions observed for most of the compounds studied in multiple windows. Significantly increased risks (13\u201370%) for asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics were seen in every time window studied for benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene. Risk estimates tended to be higher for whole pregnancy average exposures for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. No interaction was observed for methyl-tertiary butyl ether, sesquiterpene or styrene. Preeclampsia risk estimates were elevated for both asthmatics (39%) and non-asthmatics (15%) in relation to second trimester benzene exposure and whole pregnancy exposure increased risk for asthmatics only.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 4-xylene are both mentioned in relation to their exposure risks for asthmatics during pregnancy. While SO2 exposure is associated with risk reductions for non-asthmatics, 4-xylene, along with other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is linked to significantly increased risks for asthmatics. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and 4-xylene is not directly discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of air quality impacts on health rather than having a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and 4-xylene, as both are discussed in the context of exposure risks for asthmatics, but their relationship is not elaborated upon or quantitatively analyzed.",
