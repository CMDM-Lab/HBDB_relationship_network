    "context": "While air pollution can exacerbate asthma (Guarnieri and Balmes, 2014), only one prior study examined the interaction of asthma and air pollutants, looking exclusively at first trimester exposure to NOx and O3. Olsson et al. (2013). This Swedish register-based study found no relation between preeclampsia and NOx and no significant interactions for O3 and asthma in the risk for preeclampsia. Our aim was to examine whether the relationships between preeclampsia and criteria air pollutant exposures as well as exposure to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were different among women with and without asthma, for exposures preconception and throughout pregnancy, in a large contemporary U.S. obstetric cohort. Study population Our study is based on a retrospective cohort of 228,438 births at \u226523 weeks gestation assembled using hospital delivery admission electronic medical records (both mother and neonate charts) from 12 centers (19 hospitals; 15 hospital referral regions) across the United States (Zhang et al., 2010). We excluded multifetal pregnancies (n=5053), pregnancies missing air quality data (n=10) or maternal age (n=307), women with chronic hypertension (n=4358) and superimposed preeclampsia (n=1889) because they were not at risk for new-onset hypertension. We also excluded women with gestational hypertension (n=6074) or eclampsia (n=239) to allow comparison of preeclampsia cases to a normotensive reference group. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are both mentioned as air pollutants that may have implications for health outcomes, particularly in relation to asthma and preeclampsia. However, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between sulfur dioxide and PAHs, focusing instead on their individual roles in air pollution and health risks during pregnancy. The study aims to explore the effects of various air pollutants, including PAHs and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but does not specifically link sulfur dioxide to PAHs in the analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and PAHs are categorized as air pollutants relevant to health outcomes, but their specific relationship is not detailed in the context provided.",
        "score": 2
