    "context": "Smoking was less common in pregnancies with preeclampsia for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. We observed significant interactions for NOx and SO2 in the first trimester and for elemental carbon in the whole pregnancy average, with higher risk estimates among asthmatics ( Table 2). Risks were significantly elevated 11% for asthmatics in association with whole pregnancy elemental carbon exposure and 10% for second trimester CO exposure. Among non-asthmatics, significant risk reductions were observed for first trimester NOx and SO2 exposure, with elevated risks associated with elemental carbon and organic compounds in the second trimester, sulfite particles in the first trimester and whole pregnancy dust particles. The interaction of VOCs and asthma ( Table 3) reveals a fairly consistent pattern of increased risk for asthmatics (6\u201370%) with significant interactions observed for most of the compounds studied in multiple windows. Significantly increased risks (13\u201370%) for asthmatics compared to non-asthmatics were seen in every time window studied for benzene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene. Risk estimates tended to be higher for whole pregnancy average exposures for both asthmatics and non-asthmatics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon are both mentioned as pollutants associated with increased health risks during pregnancy, particularly for asthmatic individuals. The study highlights significant interactions between SO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the first trimester, as well as elemental carbon exposure throughout the pregnancy. While SO2 exposure showed risk reductions for non-asthmatics, the overall relationship indicates that both pollutants are relevant in assessing respiratory risks during pregnancy, especially for asthmatics.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide and carbon are discussed in relation to their health impacts during pregnancy, particularly for asthmatics. Their interactions with other pollutants suggest a shared significance, but the context does not provide detailed mechanisms linking them directly.",
