    "context": "[1] Conclusions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAthletes and exercisers should avoid exercising by the road side even though levels of the more noxious air pollutants have been controlled in the United Kingdom. [2] O3 is particularly damaging to athletes; it reaches its highest concentrations on hot bright days in rural areas. [1] Air pollution continues to be a matter for concern despite falling levels of some of the major pollutants. [2] The aim of this review is to examine six major pollutants in relation to exercise: carbon monoxide (CO); nitrogen oxides (NOx); ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM10); sulphur dioxide (SO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCs). [3] Many of the effects of air pollution on human health have long been established, but no clear consensus has been reached on the effects of ambient air pollution on the exercising athlete and sport performance. [4] A second aim of this review is to relate current ambient air pollution levels to exercising subjects. [5] Maynard identified a need to understand the effects of long term exposure to current concentrations of air pollutants, and a need to identify groups of the population with greater than average sensitivity to them.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are both identified as major air pollutants that can impact human health, particularly for athletes and exercisers. The review aims to examine the effects of these pollutants, among others, on exercise performance and health. While both pollutants are mentioned together in the context of air quality and health concerns, their specific interactions or combined effects on exercise are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, as they are both categorized as significant air pollutants affecting health. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or combined effects in the context provided.",
