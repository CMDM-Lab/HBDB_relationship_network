    "context": "[1] Conclusions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAthletes and exercisers should avoid exercising by the road side even though levels of the more noxious air pollutants have been controlled in the United Kingdom. [2] O3 is particularly damaging to athletes; it reaches its highest concentrations on hot bright days in rural areas. [1] Air pollution continues to be a matter for concern despite falling levels of some of the major pollutants. [2] The aim of this review is to examine six major pollutants in relation to exercise: carbon monoxide (CO); nitrogen oxides (NOx); ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM10); sulphur dioxide (SO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCs). [3] Many of the effects of air pollution on human health have long been established, but no clear consensus has been reached on the effects of ambient air pollution on the exercising athlete and sport performance. [4] A second aim of this review is to relate current ambient air pollution levels to exercising subjects. [5] Maynard identified a need to understand the effects of long term exposure to current concentrations of air pollutants, and a need to identify groups of the population with greater than average sensitivity to them.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major air pollutants alongside organic chemicals, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The review discusses the impact of various air pollutants, including SO2, on human health and exercise performance. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals, indicating a general association rather than a significant connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals are both categorized as air pollutants discussed in relation to health effects, but their specific interactions or relationships are not elaborated upon in the context.",
