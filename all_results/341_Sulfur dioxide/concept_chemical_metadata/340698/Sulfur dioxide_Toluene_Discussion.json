    "context": "No histological differences were evident in the spleen of the quail in terms of the number of germinal centers (\u03a7 2 =2.56; df= 2; p=0.63) and the cell density of the PALS (\u03a7 2 =4.18; df= 2; p=0.12) among the dosing groups (Table 2). Similarly, there were no differences in the relative mass of the bursa of Fabricius (F 2,29=0.57; p=0.6), and no histological differences in cell density (\u03a7 2 =2.46; df=2; p=0.65) or degree of apoptosis in the medulla of this organ (\u03a7 2 =2.79; df= 2; p=0.59) among the quail treatment groups (Table 2). In this study, inhalation exposure to mixtures of benzene, toluene, NO2 and SO2 induced EROD, although not quite statistically so, in adult American kestrels but not in juvenile Japanese quail, resulted in increased plasma CORT concentrations in both species, and had no immunomodulatory effects in either species. Avian defense mechanisms against toxic substances vary among species, and are poorly understood although birds are able to modulate their detoxification systems in response to pollution levels (Rainio et al., 2012). We know from many other species, that biotransformation capacity is very species-specific. In agreement with our results, species and age differences have been reported for the catalytic activity of CYP 450 enzymes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are mentioned as components of a mixture that was inhaled by birds, specifically American kestrels and Japanese quail. The study investigates the effects of this mixture on various physiological parameters, including EROD activity and plasma CORT concentrations. However, there is no direct discussion of the specific interactions or combined effects of sulfur dioxide and toluene on the birds' health or detoxification mechanisms, indicating a lack of detailed relationship between the two substances.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and toluene are part of a mixture studied for their effects on avian physiology, but their specific interactions or combined effects are not elaborated upon in the context.",
