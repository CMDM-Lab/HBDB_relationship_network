    "context": "2.2.2 Gas mixture and rationale for dose selection The low dose for quail and the only dose of contaminant gas mixture for the kestrels were based on air contaminant data recorded at monitoring stations located throughout the oil sands regions from the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA) during 2010. Specifically, the 1-h maximum concentrations that were recorded at each station were averaged, and multiplied by a safety factor of 100 (Merril, 2003) for benzene and toluene since similar concentrations have been used before on kestrels without evidence of morbidity (Olsgard et al., 2008). For NO2 and SO2 there were limited references on which to base the concentrations without lethal effects. The closest concentrations (averaged maximum concentration recorded in a 6-month period near a coal-fired power plant) were 0.28ppm for NO2 and 0.5ppm SO2. Therefore, for the quail, the 1-h maximum concentrations recorded at each station for NO2 and SO2 were averaged and multiplied by a factor of 10. For the kestrels this safety factor was increased to 100 since no mortalities or overt health effects were seen in the quail. For the quail, the control group was dosed with hydrocarbon-free air; the low dose group with a combination of 0.6ppm benzene, 1ppm toluene, 0.2ppm NO2 and 0.5ppm SO2; and the high dose group with 100 times the concentration of the low dose group (Merril, 2003).

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to air quality monitoring near a coal-fired power plant. The concentrations of SO2 were derived from data collected in the vicinity of coal combustion, indicating a direct link between coal burning and the emission of sulfur dioxide. This relationship highlights the environmental impact of coal as a source of SO2 pollution, which is relevant for assessing air quality and potential health effects on wildlife, such as quail and kestrels.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and coal, as the context discusses SO2 concentrations specifically measured near a coal-fired power plant, indicating a clear relationship between coal combustion and SO2 emissions.",
        "score": 4
