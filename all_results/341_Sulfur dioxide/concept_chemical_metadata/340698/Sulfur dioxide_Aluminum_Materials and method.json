    "context": "Blood samples were taken at the beginning, middle and end of the exposure trial and used to determine CORT levels and antibody responses. 2.1.2 American kestrels In a separate trial, 20 (17 females and 3 males), adult (3\u20137 years old) American kestrels were obtained from a breeding colony (avian science conservation center, McGill university). The birds were individually identified with fluorescent color and aluminum leg bands and randomly allocated into 2 groups (control and exposed, n=10/group) except for the three males that were allocated to the control group because they were required by another facility after this study. The birds were housed together in an indoor flight room (7m widex5m highx3m long) with controlled ventilation, temperature (21\u201323\u00b0C), and light cycle (12-h. light/dark); the same conditions as used with the quail. The room had wood shavings covering the floor, a perch (1-in. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and aluminum are mentioned in relation to a study involving American kestrels, where aluminum leg bands were used for identification of the birds. However, there is no direct discussion of the relationship between sulfur dioxide and aluminum, nor any indication of how they may interact or affect the study's outcomes. Their mention appears coincidental, with no specific relevance to each other in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as sulfur dioxide and aluminum are mentioned without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to the study involving American kestrels. They appear in the context without a direct connection.",
