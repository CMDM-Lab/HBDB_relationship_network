    "context": "Therefore, for the quail, the 1-h maximum concentrations recorded at each station for NO2 and SO2 were averaged and multiplied by a factor of 10. For the kestrels this safety factor was increased to 100 since no mortalities or overt health effects were seen in the quail. For the quail, the control group was dosed with hydrocarbon-free air; the low dose group with a combination of 0.6ppm benzene, 1ppm toluene, 0.2ppm NO2 and 0.5ppm SO2; and the high dose group with 100 times the concentration of the low dose group (Merril, 2003). For the kestrels, the control group was dosed with air and the exposed group with 0.6ppm benzene, 1ppm toluene, 2ppm NO2 and 5.6ppm SO2. 2.2.3 Dosing protocol and exposure times The studies were conducted in October\u2013November (quail) and November\u2013December (kestrels) 2011. The birds were transported from their cages/flight room into the inhalation chamber where the control group was exposed first, followed by the low, and then high dose groups. The chamber was flushed for 5\u20137min with hydrocarbon-free air between dosing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are both mentioned as components of the exposure protocols for quail and kestrels. The birds were subjected to varying concentrations of these pollutants, along with other hydrocarbons like benzene. However, the relationship between SO2 and toluene is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup, indicating they are part of a broader study on the effects of air pollutants on avian health.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide and toluene are both included in the exposure protocols for the birds, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific effects in relation to each other.",
        "score": 2
