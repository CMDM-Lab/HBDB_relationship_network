    "context": "Immunotoxicology studies in contaminant-exposed mammals describe both antibody mediated immunosuppression, plus thymic and splenic atrophy (Kennedy et al., 2004; Peden-Adams et al., 2008). Yet in quail exposed to the same contaminant, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), of the four immunotoxicity tests including a disease challenge, only the T cell response was suppressed (Smits and Nain, 2013), which raises the possibility that Japanese quail are a relatively insensitive species. From this study we cannot determine if specific contaminants affected the birds or if it was the mixture of compounds. The long-term effects of NO2 and SO2 emitted from a coal-fired power plant were described for two species of passerines (a different order than quail and kestrels) and one rodent species. These animals were kept for 6 months in outdoor cages 2km from the power plant. Average concentrations over 5 months were 0.1ppm for SO2 and 0.006ppm NO2. For these exposed birds, the tracheas had excessive mucus and shorter cilia compared to controls. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a contaminant emitted from coal-fired power plants, which has been studied for its long-term effects on wildlife, particularly passerines and rodents. The study highlights the impact of SO2 exposure on respiratory health, evidenced by excessive mucus and shorter cilia in the tracheas of exposed birds. This establishes a direct relationship between coal combustion and the release of SO2, linking coal as a source of this harmful pollutant affecting animal health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and coal, as SO2 is a direct byproduct of coal combustion, and the context provides evidence of its detrimental effects on wildlife health due to exposure.",
