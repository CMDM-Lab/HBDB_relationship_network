    "context": "Among the major air pollutants are sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Gosselin et al., 2010). However, there is limited information on the immunotoxic and stress-mediated effects from air borne contaminants on biota compared to on-going aquatic toxicology research. Using birds to study the effects of air pollutants is advantageous because of their uniquely sensitive respiratory anatomy and physiology (Brown et al., 1997). Therefore, an experimental inhalation study was designed to test the hypothesis that exposure to inhaled benzene, toluene, NO2 and SO2, would induce hepatic EROD and alter the stress and immune responses of captive Japanese quail and American kestrels. In addition, we hypothesized that EROD induction would be detectable in feather tissue (growing feathers). Animals and housing conditions 2.1.1 Japanese quail Using protocols approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Calgary, the dosing trial was conducted with 36 male, juvenile (3-wk old) Japanese quail purchased from a local breeder (Byrconn Dev.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are both identified as air pollutants that may have immunotoxic effects on biota, specifically in birds. The study aims to investigate the impact of inhaled pollutants, including SO2 and toluene, on hepatic enzyme induction and stress responses in Japanese quail and American kestrels. While both pollutants are part of the same experimental framework, the specific interactions between SO2 and toluene are not detailed, indicating a shared relevance as air contaminants rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both sulfur dioxide and toluene are included in the same study investigating their effects on birds, indicating they are part of a broader investigation into air pollution. However, their specific interactions or comparative effects are not elaborated upon.",
