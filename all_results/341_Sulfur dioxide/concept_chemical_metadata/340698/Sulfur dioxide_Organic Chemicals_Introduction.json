    "context": "Aquatic contaminants typical of the oil sands region, such as naphthenic acids (NAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have induced hepatic EROD in fish (Colavecchia et al., 2007; Tetreault et al., 2003), wood frogs (Hersikorn and Smits 2011), and birds including tree swallows (Smits et al., 2000, Gentes et al., 2006) and ducks (Gurney et al., 2005). Similarly, immunotoxic effects, including decreased circulating leukocytes and decreased antibody response to a bacterial pathogen, have been described in fish (Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed in situ to oil sands processed waters (OSPW) and experimentally to NAs (Leclair et al., 2013; McNeill et al., 2012). In addition to contaminants in OSPW, airborne contaminants are emitted from oil sands operations. Among the major air pollutants are sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Gosselin et al., 2010). However, there is limited information on the immunotoxic and stress-mediated effects from air borne contaminants on biota compared to on-going aquatic toxicology research. Using birds to study the effects of air pollutants is advantageous because of their uniquely sensitive respiratory anatomy and physiology (Brown et al., 1997). Therefore, an experimental inhalation study was designed to test the hypothesis that exposure to inhaled benzene, toluene, NO2 and SO2, would induce hepatic EROD and alter the stress and immune responses of captive Japanese quail and American kestrels.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as one of the major airborne contaminants emitted from oil sands operations, alongside other organic chemicals such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study aims to investigate the immunotoxic and stress-mediated effects of these airborne pollutants, including SO2, on birds, highlighting the relevance of organic chemicals in assessing environmental impacts on wildlife. However, the specific interactions between SO2 and organic chemicals are not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is mentioned as an airborne contaminant related to organic chemicals in the context of environmental toxicity studies. While they are connected through the broader theme of pollution, the specific relationship is not deeply explored.",
