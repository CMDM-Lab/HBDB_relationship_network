    "context": "The closest concentrations (averaged maximum concentration recorded in a 6-month period near a coal-fired power plant) were 0.28ppm for NO2 and 0.5ppm SO2. Therefore, for the quail, the 1-h maximum concentrations recorded at each station for NO2 and SO2 were averaged and multiplied by a factor of 10. For the kestrels this safety factor was increased to 100 since no mortalities or overt health effects were seen in the quail. For the quail, the control group was dosed with hydrocarbon-free air; the low dose group with a combination of 0.6ppm benzene, 1ppm toluene, 0.2ppm NO2 and 0.5ppm SO2; and the high dose group with 100 times the concentration of the low dose group (Merril, 2003). For the kestrels, the control group was dosed with air and the exposed group with 0.6ppm benzene, 1ppm toluene, 2ppm NO2 and 5.6ppm SO2. 2.2.3 Dosing protocol and exposure times The studies were conducted in October\u2013November (quail) and November\u2013December (kestrels) 2011. The birds were transported from their cages/flight room into the inhalation chamber where the control group was exposed first, followed by the low, and then high dose groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrocarbons are both pollutants included in the exposure protocols for quail and kestrels near a coal-fired power plant. The study examines the effects of these pollutants on the birds, with specific concentrations of hydrocarbons like benzene and toluene being administered alongside SO2. However, the relationship between SO2 and hydrocarbons is primarily as co-exposures rather than a direct interaction or metabolic relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide and hydrocarbons are both part of the exposure study, indicating they are relevant to the same environmental health context. However, their specific interactions or combined effects are not deeply explored.",
        "score": 3
