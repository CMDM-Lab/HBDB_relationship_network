    "context": "Measuring the activity of mixed function oxidases (MFOs) has become a standard means for determining xenobiotic exposure in wild animals including birds (Melancon, 1996; Custer et al., 2001). This is a surrogate measure to indicate the animal's effort to detoxify foreign substances through biotransformation. One of the components of this enzymatic system, the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) isozymes, is often used to determine exposure to hydrocarbon-related compounds (Rattner and Eastin, 1981). For example, the induction of CYP 4501A1, measured by the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) assay (Walker, 1998), is considered a biomarker of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Whyte et al., 2000). The EROD assay, mainly done with hepatic microsomes, requires euthanasia of the animals. However, since CYP 450 activity has been detected in endothelial cells of several tissues, including the integument (Ben-David et al., 2001), growing feathers of birds having active vasculature, might be a tissue in which contaminant exposure can be detected non-lethally (Melancon et al., 2006). Aquatic contaminants typical of the oil sands region, such as naphthenic acids (NAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), have induced hepatic EROD in fish (Colavecchia et al., 2007; Tetreault et al., 2003), wood frogs (Hersikorn and Smits 2011), and birds including tree swallows (Smits et al., 2000, Gentes et al., 2006) and ducks (Gurney et al., 2005).

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are both mentioned in relation to the assessment of mixed function oxidases (MFOs) and cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) activity as biomarkers for xenobiotic exposure in wildlife. While sulfur dioxide is not directly linked to PAHs in the discussion, both are part of the broader context of environmental contaminants affecting animal health and detoxification processes. However, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and PAHs is not elaborated upon, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and PAHs are discussed in the context of environmental exposure and detoxification in wildlife, but there is no detailed interaction or specific relationship established between them.",
