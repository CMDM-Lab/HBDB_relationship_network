    "context": "All the gas lines merged into a 4-piece, stainless steel fitting and from there, the gas mixture passed through a flow meter (Matheson Tri-gas\u00ae, Inc., Basking Ridge, NJ, USA), attached to a bubbler humidifier (Salter Labs, Arvin, CA, USA). The gas mixture then flowed through two stainless steel chambers each with six individual animal holding units (straight 2.6-in. diameter PCV tubes with interior perches). After passing through the animal holding units, the gas mixture flowed through a carbon-activated filter and into the room's exhaust and scavenger system. To fit the quail morphology, the straight PCV tubes were replaced by \u201cS\u201d-shaped PCV tubes (4-in. widex13-in. long), with flat stainless steel mesh perches ( Fig. 2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and carbon are both components of a gas mixture that is being processed through a series of chambers and filters. While sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as being filtered or treated, the carbon-activated filter is noted as part of the system designed to manage the gas mixture. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between sulfur dioxide and carbon beyond their presence in the same system.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as sulfur dioxide and carbon are mentioned in the same context related to gas handling, but their relationship is not explicitly defined or explored. They share a general category of being components in a gas mixture without detailed interaction.",
