        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are both mentioned as components of air pollution, specifically categorized under pollutants that may affect health and environmental quality. However, the context does not provide any specific details about their interactions, mechanisms, or comparative significance, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are both identified as air pollutants but lack a detailed discussion of their interactions or specific roles in the context provided.",
