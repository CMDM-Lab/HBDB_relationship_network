    "context": "[3] 2) Reported symptoms during the last 12 months: asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the last 1 yr. [4] 3) Reported diagnosis during life: lifetime asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema. [5] The methods used to assess the six reported outcomes through the replies to the ISAAC questions  are briefly summarised in the supplementary material. [1] Long-term exposure of the 6,683 children for whom complete health data were available (refer to the supplementary material for details on the participation rate) was assessed through 3-yr averaged (from 1998 to 2000) concentrations of major urban air pollutants (benzene, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), NO2, NOx and CO), estimated through the validated STREET 5 software (Targeting, Versailles, France), at the 108 school addresses. [2] Home addresses were not available. [1] The implemented methods, as described previously , are briefly summarised below. [2] To obtain annual mean concentrations of air pollutants, STREET, which is based on a dispersion model, combines data on both a regional component (background air pollution) and a local component, which depends on both traffic emissions and local dispersion conditions (topography and meteorology) in the modelled street segment (refer to supplementary material).

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed in relation to health outcomes in children, alongside organic chemicals such as benzene and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While SO2 is a specific pollutant, organic chemicals represent a broader category of compounds that can include various harmful substances. The relationship is indirect, as both are part of the air quality assessment but not specifically linked in terms of their interactions or combined effects on health.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals, as they are both included in the assessment of urban air pollutants affecting health outcomes. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or combined effects.",
