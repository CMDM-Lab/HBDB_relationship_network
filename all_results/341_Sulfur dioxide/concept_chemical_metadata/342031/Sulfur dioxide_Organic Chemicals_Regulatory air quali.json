    "context": "This is much in parallel with the German TA Luft 1985 (Umweltrecht, 1995). Presently, however the air quality limits are subject to a radical change by the Ministry of Environment. For reasons of interest in international activities and trade WHO (Europe) criteria and European Community (EC) directives were also being closely followed in many case studies. As already stated, this revision of Turkish regulation include stricter SO2, PM10, NO2, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), and CO pollution limits at short- and long-term averages. However the proposed revisions of SO2 and PM are above the WHO guidelines of 1996 and EC limits (Table 1) . Turkish Air Quality Protection Regulation (MOE, 1986) foresees SO2 and PM short-term limits of 400 \u03bcg/m3 and 300 \u03bcg/m3 as well as long-term limit values of 150 \u03bcg/m3 for both. However in many Turkish cities the concentration of these pollutants were known to be above these limits. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a regulated air pollutant alongside other organic chemicals, specifically non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC). The discussion focuses on air quality limits and regulations, indicating that SO2 is part of a broader category of organic chemicals that are monitored for environmental health. However, there is no detailed interaction or specific relationship between SO2 and organic chemicals beyond their classification as pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals are both mentioned in the context of air quality regulations. They share a general category as pollutants, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships.",
        "score": 2
