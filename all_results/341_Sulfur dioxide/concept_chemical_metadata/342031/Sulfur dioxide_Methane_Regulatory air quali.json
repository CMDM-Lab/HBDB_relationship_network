    "context": "This is much in parallel with the German TA Luft 1985 (Umweltrecht, 1995). Presently, however the air quality limits are subject to a radical change by the Ministry of Environment. For reasons of interest in international activities and trade WHO (Europe) criteria and European Community (EC) directives were also being closely followed in many case studies. As already stated, this revision of Turkish regulation include stricter SO2, PM10, NO2, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), and CO pollution limits at short- and long-term averages. However the proposed revisions of SO2 and PM are above the WHO guidelines of 1996 and EC limits (Table 1) . Turkish Air Quality Protection Regulation (MOE, 1986) foresees SO2 and PM short-term limits of 400 \u03bcg/m3 and 300 \u03bcg/m3 as well as long-term limit values of 150 \u03bcg/m3 for both. However in many Turkish cities the concentration of these pollutants were known to be above these limits. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methane are both mentioned as pollutants regulated under Turkish air quality standards. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. The focus is primarily on the limits set for SO2 and particulate matter (PM), with methane not being highlighted in terms of its impact or regulation in the same manner. Thus, while both are part of air quality considerations, their connection is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between sulfur dioxide and methane, as they are merely listed among pollutants without any discussion of their interactions or significance in the context provided.",
