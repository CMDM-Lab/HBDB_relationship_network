    "context": "Table 3). No histological differences were evident in the spleen of the quail in terms of the number of germinal centers (\u03a7 2 =2.56; df= 2; p=0.63) and the cell density of the PALS (\u03a7 2 =4.18; df= 2; p=0.12) among the dosing groups (Table 2). Similarly, there were no differences in the relative mass of the bursa of Fabricius (F 2,29=0.57; p=0.6), and no histological differences in cell density (\u03a7 2 =2.46; df=2; p=0.65) or degree of apoptosis in the medulla of this organ (\u03a7 2 =2.79; df= 2; p=0.59) among the quail treatment groups (Table 2). In this study, inhalation exposure to mixtures of benzene, toluene, NO2 and SO2 induced EROD, although not quite statistically so, in adult American kestrels but not in juvenile Japanese quail, resulted in increased plasma CORT concentrations in both species, and had no immunomodulatory effects in either species. Avian defense mechanisms against toxic substances vary among species, and are poorly understood although birds are able to modulate their detoxification systems in response to pollution levels (Rainio et al., 2012). We know from many other species, that biotransformation capacity is very species-specific. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to a study examining its effects alongside other pollutants on avian species. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with apoptosis. The study notes no significant differences in the degree of apoptosis in the medulla of the bursa of Fabricius among treatment groups, indicating that SO2 exposure did not lead to observable apoptotic changes in the examined tissues of the quail.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between sulfur dioxide and apoptosis, as the context only mentions SO2 in the context of exposure without any evidence or discussion of its impact on apoptotic processes.",
