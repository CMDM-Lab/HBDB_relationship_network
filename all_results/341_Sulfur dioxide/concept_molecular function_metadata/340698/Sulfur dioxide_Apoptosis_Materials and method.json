    "context": "The criteria for grading the PALS density was: 1=depleted (a conspicuous space present between the cells of approximately one cell large), 2=moderate (a clear space present around most of the cells), and 3=dense (cells touching or overlapping each other). For the bursa of Fabricius of quail, the cell density and the degree of apoptosis were assessed in the medulla of 5 randomly chosen follicles. The criteria to evaluate the cell density were the same as for the spleen. For the degree of apoptosis the criterion was: 1=low (\u22644 cell-sized spaces containing cellular debris), 2=moderate (4\u20136 cell-sized spaces) and 3=high (>6 cell-sized empty spaces). 2.3.5 Statistical analyzes The statistical analyzes were conducted separately for each species. The associations between the independent variable (treatment groups) and the continuous dependent variables (EROD activity, corticosterone, and immune responses) were assessed through general linear models. Normality and homogeneity of variances were tested through the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and Levene's test, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not explicitly mentioned in relation to apoptosis. The study focuses on assessing cell density and apoptosis in the bursa of Fabricius of quail, but does not provide any direct evidence or discussion linking sulfur dioxide exposure to the apoptotic processes being evaluated. Therefore, while both terms are relevant to cellular biology, their relationship is not established in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between sulfur dioxide and apoptosis in the provided context. They are mentioned in the same biological field but without any specific interaction or relevance discussed.",
