    "context": "The birds were fed 1.5 frozen/thawed cockerels/bird/day that were soaked in warm water for 30min prior to feeding. After a 2-wk acclimation period, pre-dosing blood samples were collected as for the quail. To minimize stress, the room lights were dimmed to very low levels for cleaning, feeding and for capturing the birds to transport them to the inhalation chamber. Blood samples were taken from the birds at the beginning, middle and end of the exposure trial and the plasma was used to determine CORT and antibody responses.Experimental design 2.2.1 Inhalation chamber We used a whole body, avian-specific inhalation chamber (Olsgard and Smits 2008) with the following modifications ( Fig. 1). To prevent corrosion of the chamber's components, the copper piping was replaced with polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (0.5-in. diameter) and the copper fittings were replaced by stainless steel fittings (Calgary Valve and Fittings Ltd., Calgary, AB, Canada). The gas mixtures and the hydrocarbon-free air (for controls) were released from pre-filled aluminum and steel cylinders (Praxair Inc., Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada; concentration accuracy\u00b15%, manufacturer guarantee), except for the low dose of NO2 that was diluted by mixing this gas with air into a 3-in.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to an inhalation chamber used for exposure trials on birds. While the study involves measuring physiological responses, including potential impacts on inspiration function, there is no direct discussion of how sulfur dioxide specifically affects the inspiration function of the birds. The focus is more on the experimental setup rather than a clear relationship between SO2 and respiratory function.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is part of the inhalation study, which may impact inspiration function, but the relationship is not explicitly detailed or supported by data in the context provided.",
