    "context": "The birds were fed 1.5 frozen/thawed cockerels/bird/day that were soaked in warm water for 30min prior to feeding. After a 2-wk acclimation period, pre-dosing blood samples were collected as for the quail. To minimize stress, the room lights were dimmed to very low levels for cleaning, feeding and for capturing the birds to transport them to the inhalation chamber. Blood samples were taken from the birds at the beginning, middle and end of the exposure trial and the plasma was used to determine CORT and antibody responses.Experimental design 2.2.1 Inhalation chamber We used a whole body, avian-specific inhalation chamber (Olsgard and Smits 2008) with the following modifications ( Fig. 1). To prevent corrosion of the chamber's components, the copper piping was replaced with polytetrafluoroethylene tubing (0.5-in. diameter) and the copper fittings were replaced by stainless steel fittings (Calgary Valve and Fittings Ltd., Calgary, AB, Canada). The gas mixtures and the hydrocarbon-free air (for controls) were released from pre-filled aluminum and steel cylinders (Praxair Inc., Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada; concentration accuracy\u00b15%, manufacturer guarantee), except for the low dose of NO2 that was diluted by mixing this gas with air into a 3-in.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to an experimental design involving birds exposed to various gas mixtures, including inhalation trials. While blood samples were collected to assess antibody responses, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide exposure and antibody formation is not directly discussed. The context primarily focuses on the methodology of exposure and sample collection rather than detailing any immunological effects of sulfur dioxide on antibody production.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is part of the inhalation study, but there is no detailed discussion on how it specifically influences antibody formation. The relationship is more about the experimental setup than a direct interaction.",
