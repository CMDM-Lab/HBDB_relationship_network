    "context": "The relatively lower daytime concentrations of SO2, in the city of Volos, compared to those of Patras, would be attributed, besides perhaps the difference in emissions, to the relatively higher oxidation of SO2 to sulfate ( SO 4 2 - )\u2014under the effect of solar radiation\u2014and to the observed higher ozone concentration, and probably to OH (Harrison and Perry, 1986). Khoder\u2019s (2002) results show that the oxidation processes and conversion of SO2 to sulfate and of NO2 to nitrate (NO3), depend on the photochemical oxidation and that the sulfur conversion ratio increases with increasing ozone concentration. The higher ozone concentrations in Volos, compared to those in Patras, may contribute to the higher conversion ratio of sulfur in Volos than in Patras, where higher values of SO2 were observed. The different rates of SO2 oxidation between the two cities may partially explain the descent of SO2 in Volos during midday hours, when ozone is quite high, leading in a substantially different pattern in comparison to that in Patras, where the lower ozone levels allow increased SO2 concentrations during midday hours. Besides that reason, the more frequent ship calls in the very busy harbor of Patras and the heavy commercial trucks and articulated lorries which call the harbor, probably lead to the SO2 accumulation during the daytime hours and cause this different pattern. It will be interesting to compare this SO2 diurnal pattern with that of the following years, when the new harbor of Patras, being under construction at the west edge of the city, will be operating, and thus all the traffic of cars using the ferry-boats, will leave or arrive to that new harbor through the new highway, by-passing the city of Patras. The two peaks of NO are strong during the months from October to March in both cities, mainly in Patras. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes, particularly its conversion to sulfate (SO4^2-) under the influence of solar radiation and higher ozone concentrations. The study highlights how the oxidation of SO2 varies between the cities of Volos and Patras, with higher ozone levels in Volos contributing to a greater conversion ratio of SO2 to sulfate. This indicates a significant relationship where oxidation plays a crucial role in the atmospheric behavior of sulfur dioxide.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between sulfur dioxide and oxidation, as the context provides evidence of the oxidation processes affecting SO2 levels and their conversion to sulfate, supported by quantitative observations of ozone concentrations.",
