    "context": "The productivity, fuel consumption rate, and lifetime of the spreader was estimated to be 4.4ha/h, 5L/h, and 1200h, respectively (Mann and Spath, 1997). Truck use in the transportation of ash and plant materials for landfilling was assumed to be similar to that for biomass transportation and relevant inventory data are presented in Table 3. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions impact The life cycle GHG emission impacts of the direct co-firing pathways are shown in Fig. 2 . The GHG emissions (Fig. 2) do not include the impacts of coal and only environmental impacts for 1MWh of biomass-based power generation for all the pathways are shown. From the GHG emission perspective, AR-based power generation is the most favorable option of biomass-based power generation followed by power generation from FR and WT, irrespective of the densification technology (Fig. 2). This outcome is mainly because AR is considered a by-product in the base case and AR is available at a much lower moisture content (14wt.%) compared to FR (45wt.%) ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts related to biomass-based power generation. The environmental impacts are assessed in terms of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, which may include sulfur dioxide as a pollutant. However, there is no direct connection or detailed analysis of sulfur dioxide's specific impacts on the environment within the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is a known environmental pollutant that could be relevant to greenhouse gas emissions discussions, but it is not specifically addressed in the context provided.",
