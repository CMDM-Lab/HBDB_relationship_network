    "context": "This life cycle study was performed based on the system boundary presented in Fig. 1. The energy and environmental data for coal production, processing, and combustion in Alberta were taken from existing literature (McCulloch et al., 2000), and were not analyzed in the present study. Fig. 1 shows only the processes investigated in the present study. The life cycle of each power generation pathway was divided into the unit processes (UP), biomass production (UP 1), biomass transportation (UP 2), preprocessing (UP 3), transportation to end-user (UP 4), and power production (UP 5). Embodied energy and emission factors for all the material, equipment, and energy flows associated with the system were determined from their respective life cycles. Energy and environmental performance results of a power generation pathway were normalized corresponding to a functional unit (FU). Results were normalized to FU, but inventory data were not normalized. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as a part of any specific process but is likely a byproduct of the processes involved in coal production, processing, and combustion. The study focuses on the life cycle of power generation pathways, which includes various unit processes, but does not detail the role or impact of sulfur dioxide within these processes. Therefore, while sulfur dioxide is relevant to the broader context of emissions from coal-related processes, its specific relationship to the processes described is not directly addressed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is associated with coal processing and combustion, but the context does not provide detailed information on its specific role or impact within the described processes.",
