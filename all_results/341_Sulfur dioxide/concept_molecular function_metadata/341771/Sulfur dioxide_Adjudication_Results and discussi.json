    "context": "Conversely, the frequency of days with NO2 and SO2 concentrations above the corresponding 24-h standard was less than the frequency of days above the corresponding 1-h standard at all sites. Thus, it would seem that, for O3, the 8-h standard is more stringent than the 1-h standard, while for NO2 and SO2, the 1-h standard is more stringent than the 24-h standard.Relationship with meteorological conditions To examine the possible relationships between the pollutant concentrations and various meteorological parameters, stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed between the air concentrations as the dependent variable and meteorological parameters as independent variables. The meteorological parameters included the daily average solar radiation, wind speed, temperature, relative humidity and precipitation, all of which are associated with urban air pollution (particularly, O3) levels (Broomfield et al., 1996; Krupa et al., 2003). Table 4 (Panels A and B) show the regression equations relating the air concentrations with the meteorological data, which were chosen according to the coefficient of determination (R 2) and Mallows\u2019 Cp value (Draper and Smith, 1981). The number of and type of meteorological variables included in these equations varied according to the pollutant, monitoring station, or season. For O3, all the regression equations were statistically significant. One notable result is that, in contrast to the roadside data, the regression equations obtained for the RE1 (residential monitoring station) O3 data consistently included both X 1 (solar radiation) and X 3 (air temperature) for all seasons.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to air quality standards and its concentrations in the atmosphere, particularly in comparison to other pollutants like NO2 and O3. However, there is no mention of 'adjudication' or any direct relationship between SO2 and adjudication processes. The focus is primarily on pollutant levels and meteorological factors affecting air quality, with no clear connection to adjudication.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between sulfur dioxide and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their interaction or significance.",
