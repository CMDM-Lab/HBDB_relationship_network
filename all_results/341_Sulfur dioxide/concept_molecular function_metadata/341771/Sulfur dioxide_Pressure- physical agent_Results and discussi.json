    "context": "All the current monitoring sites exhibited lower O3 concentrations in July and August compared to the other summer month, June. This is most likely due to the seasonal rain front that usually occurs in Korea between July and August. The seasonal evolution of O3 levels was parallel to that of NO2 in spring\u2013summer, and the inverse in winter, which is the usual pattern at many urban stations (Viana et al., 2003). It has been reported that O3 levels in urban areas reach high-values on spring and summer days, usually under the influence of stagnant high-pressure systems (Aneja et al., 2000), as characterized by the summer bright sunshine and high-temperatures (Table 2). Contrary to the other target compounds, for all matched months, the roadside O3 concentrations were lower than the residential concentrations. This result is likely due to high-levels of fresh NO from traffic emissions, which rapidly react with O3, thereby reducing the O3 roadside level (Yang and Miller, 2002).Standard exceedances To analyze the frequency of elevated concentrations over the study period, the number of days when the concentrations of the target pollutants exceeded the corresponding 1-h, 8-h, or 24-h standards was totaled. The frequencies were then determined by calculating the total number of days with concentrations exceeding the corresponding standard as a percentage of the total number of sampling days over the specified time period (Table 3 ).

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned in relation to pressure as a physical agent. The discussion focuses on ozone (O3) levels and their seasonal variations influenced by high-pressure systems. While pressure can affect the dispersion and concentration of pollutants like SO2, there is no explicit connection made between sulfur dioxide and pressure in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between sulfur dioxide and pressure in the context. They are mentioned in the same discussion about air quality, but there is no evidence or discussion linking them meaningfully.",
