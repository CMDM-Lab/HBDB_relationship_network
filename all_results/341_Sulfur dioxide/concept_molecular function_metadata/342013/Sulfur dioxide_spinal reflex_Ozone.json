    "context": "[7] Concentration-response regression curves of lung measurements in exercising subjects show progressively increased decrements in measurements of lung function with increasing exercise intensity. [8] Other forced and inspired flow rates, inspiratory capacity and total lung capacity (TLC), are also affected, and there is increased RAW and residual volume.  [1] It has been suggested that O3 inhalation stimulates receptors located in the smooth muscle layers of the upper airways.  [2] Contraction of the inspiratory muscles is limited by the non-myelinated C fibre afferent nerves of vagal origin, which may act through axonal reflex connections or through spinal reflexes.  [3] The net effect on the human lung is involuntary inhibition of full inspiration, reduction of transpulmonary pressure and inspiratory capacity, and increased flow resistance.  [4] There is an associated decrease in maximal expiratory flow rates, TLC, and vital capacity accompanied by substernal pain and coughing.  [5] Research has shown an influx of inflammatory cells into the pulmonary tissue. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around lung function and the effects of inhaled irritants like ozone on respiratory mechanics. The spinal reflex is referenced in relation to the inhibition of inspiratory muscle contraction via non-myelinated C fiber afferent nerves. While both terms relate to respiratory physiology, there is no explicit connection between sulfur dioxide and spinal reflexes in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both sulfur dioxide and spinal reflexes pertain to respiratory function, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or explored in the context provided.",
