    "context": "[2] Its distribution has been shown to follow the expected pattern\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat is, areas of the United Kingdom with high NO2 concentrations correlate well with the geographical distribution of the major urban conurbations and major emission sources. [3] Discussion will focus on NO2 in this section.  [1] NO2 is of concern to human health as it is soluble and can be absorbed by the mucous lining of the nasopharyngeal cavity, where it is converted to nitrous and nitric acids.  [2] The oxidant properties of NO2 after acute exposure at levels of 5000\u00e2\u20ac\u201c10 000 ppb can cause respiratory illness, such as pharyngeal irritation, cough, and dyspnoea.  [3] Resistance to respiratory infection can also be impaired by NO2 exposure below 500 ppb.  [4] NO2 levels in urban environments are usually below 150 ppb.  [5] The UK National Air Quality standard for NO2 is 150 ppb, measured as an hourly mean. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its irritative effects on the respiratory system. NO2 exposure leads to symptoms such as pharyngeal irritation and cough, which are similar to the known effects of sulfur dioxide. Both gases are irritants that can affect respiratory health, suggesting a potential parallel in their irritative properties, although sulfur dioxide is not explicitly linked in this excerpt.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and irritation, as both are known respiratory irritants. However, the context primarily discusses NO2 without detailing sulfur dioxide's specific effects, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
