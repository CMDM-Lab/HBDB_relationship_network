    "context": "[4] In the 1980s, the concentration of COHb in the blood of city dwellers was found to be approximately double that in people living in rural traffic-free areas. [5] Strenuous exercise in heavy traffic for 30 minutes can increase the level of COHb 10-fold, which is the equivalent of smoking 10 cigarettes. [1] There is no doubt that CO is detrimental to athletic performance and there is much experimental evidence of this.\u00e2\u20ac\u201c [2] With CO in the bloodstream, less O2 is released from haemoglobin to myoglobin, and therefore, to compensate, the heart must work harder and beat more frequently. [3] Maximum cardiac output and maximal arteriovenous difference are lowered, resulting in a decrease in maximum oxygen uptake (V\u00cc\u2021o2max) and work output. [4] The formation of COHb is reversible, and exposure to clean air removes most of the gas from the body, with a half life of three to four hours. [1] The risk of CO poisoning in joggers and cyclists in areas of traffic congestion is difficult to predict because the concentration and movement of CO depend on prevailing wind and temperature. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around carbon monoxide (CO) and its detrimental effects on blood circulation and athletic performance. CO binds to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues, which necessitates increased heart rate and cardiac output. While sulfur dioxide is a known air pollutant that can affect respiratory health, its direct relationship with blood circulation is not addressed in this context, making the connection indirect and speculative.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is not discussed in relation to blood circulation. The context focuses on carbon monoxide's effects, which may imply a broader discussion on air pollutants, but lacks specific evidence linking sulfur dioxide to blood circulation.",
