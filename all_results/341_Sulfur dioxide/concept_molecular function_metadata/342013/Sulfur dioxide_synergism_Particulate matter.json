    "context": "[3] There is a synergistic interaction between PM10, SO2, and water vapour. [4] Water vapour and SO2 are absorbed on to soot particles while they are present together in the ambient air, and trace metals such as vanadium in the particles catalyse the formation of sulphuric acid. [5] On inhalation, these particles transport the sulphuric acid deep into the lungs, where the gas exchange surfaces are damaged and the capacity for oxygen exchange is decreased. [6] This synergism between particles and SO2 is such that it has been incorporated into legislation, with recommendations for lower tolerable levels of SO2 when the particulate levels are above a certain concentration: the European Community, for example, specifies an annual mean of 120 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 SO2 unless the particle concentration is less than 40 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3, when the upper limit for SO2 is reduced to 80 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3. [1] During the 1990s in the United States and Canada, very many studies indicated a link between airborne particulate matter and mortality. [2] In response to growing concern in the United Kingdom on this matter, the government invited COMEAP to advise on the health effects of non-biological particles, and the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) to recommend air quality standards for particles. [3] The recommended upper limit of PM10 is currently 50 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 as a running 24 hour average in the United Kingdom, which is seldom exceeded in London, where smoke control exists, as illustrated by fig 4. In areas of Britain where there is no smoke control, high levels could build up in the winter months when temperature inversion occurs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is described as part of a synergistic interaction with PM10 and water vapor, which enhances the formation of sulfuric acid when these components are present together in the air. This synergism is significant enough to influence regulatory standards for SO2 levels based on particulate matter concentrations, indicating a critical relationship between SO2 and its synergistic effects on air quality and health outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly discusses the synergistic interaction of sulfur dioxide with other components, highlighting its critical role in air quality regulations and health impacts.",
