    "context": "[7] Concentration-response regression curves of lung measurements in exercising subjects show progressively increased decrements in measurements of lung function with increasing exercise intensity. [8] Other forced and inspired flow rates, inspiratory capacity and total lung capacity (TLC), are also affected, and there is increased RAW and residual volume.  [1] It has been suggested that O3 inhalation stimulates receptors located in the smooth muscle layers of the upper airways.  [2] Contraction of the inspiratory muscles is limited by the non-myelinated C fibre afferent nerves of vagal origin, which may act through axonal reflex connections or through spinal reflexes.  [3] The net effect on the human lung is involuntary inhibition of full inspiration, reduction of transpulmonary pressure and inspiratory capacity, and increased flow resistance.  [4] There is an associated decrease in maximal expiratory flow rates, TLC, and vital capacity accompanied by substernal pain and coughing.  [5] Research has shown an influx of inflammatory cells into the pulmonary tissue. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to contraction through its effects on lung function and respiratory mechanics. The inhalation of irritants like SO2 can lead to inflammation and increased airway resistance, which may contribute to the contraction of smooth muscles in the airways. This contraction can limit inspiratory capacity and affect overall lung function, particularly during exercise, as indicated by the decrements in lung measurements with increased exercise intensity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is implicated in respiratory effects that can lead to muscle contraction in the airways, but the relationship is not explicitly detailed or quantitatively supported in the context provided.",
        "score": 3
