    "context": "[12] Changes in pulmonary function attenuated with repeated exposures. [13] Potentially serious effects may occur, but it has generally been found that outdoor levels are low; there can be greater danger from some indoor environments such as gas heated homes and poorly ventilated residences inside which fires are lit such as are found in underdeveloped countries. [1] O3 forms in the atmosphere through very complex chemical interactions and equilibria between hundreds of different hydrocarbons and radicals and NO and NO2, all requiring photochemical energy. [2] Daily ambient O3 levels in the United Kingdom rarely exceed 100 ppb, at which concentration significant decrements in lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC); forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); mean forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c75); airway resistance (RAW)) have been observed at an exercise intensity equating to a V\u00cc\u2021e of 70.0 litres/min. [3] Figure 3 shows monthly statistics for O3 in 1997. [4] As expected, O3 levels were higher in the summer than the winter. [5] In large hot cities such as Los Angeles, a diurnal pattern of O3 concentration is observed, peaking around midday well after the morning rush hour and when solar radiation is at its highest. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to vital capacity as both are discussed in the broader context of pulmonary function and air quality. While the text primarily focuses on ozone (O3) and its effects on lung function, it implies that exposure to pollutants like SO2 can also impact vital capacity. However, there is no direct evidence or specific data linking SO2 levels to changes in vital capacity within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and vital capacity, as they are both relevant to pulmonary function but are not explicitly linked or discussed in detail in the context provided.",
