    "context": "[1] During the 1990s in the United States and Canada, very many studies indicated a link between airborne particulate matter and mortality. [2] In response to growing concern in the United Kingdom on this matter, the government invited COMEAP to advise on the health effects of non-biological particles, and the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) to recommend air quality standards for particles. [3] The recommended upper limit of PM10 is currently 50 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 as a running 24 hour average in the United Kingdom, which is seldom exceeded in London, where smoke control exists, as illustrated by fig 4. In areas of Britain where there is no smoke control, high levels could build up in the winter months when temperature inversion occurs. [4] COMEAP's report on non-biological particles and health recognised that exercise may have a variable effect on particle deposition depending on particle size and pattern of respiration. [5] It may be that, at increased airflow velocities, the pollutants are not deposited but simply exhaled. [6] As yet the question of pollutant deposition in the respiratory tract during exercise remains unanswered and uncertain. [7] What is certain is that the increased airflow velocity (a consequence of pronounced increases in V\u00cc\u2021e) bypasses much of the normal nasal filtration and carries pollutants deeper into the respiratory tract; hence there is a proportionate increase in the quantity of pollutants inhaled.

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is indirectly related to respiration through the discussion of airborne particulate matter and its health effects. The text highlights how increased airflow during exercise can lead to deeper inhalation of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, which may bypass normal nasal filtration. This suggests a potential impact of sulfur dioxide on respiratory health, particularly during physical activity, although the specific effects of sulfur dioxide on respiration are not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is mentioned in the context of respiratory health and pollutant inhalation during exercise. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and the focus is more on general pollutant effects rather than a direct interaction with respiration.",
