    "context": "[12] Changes in pulmonary function attenuated with repeated exposures. [13] Potentially serious effects may occur, but it has generally been found that outdoor levels are low; there can be greater danger from some indoor environments such as gas heated homes and poorly ventilated residences inside which fires are lit such as are found in underdeveloped countries. [1] O3 forms in the atmosphere through very complex chemical interactions and equilibria between hundreds of different hydrocarbons and radicals and NO and NO2, all requiring photochemical energy. [2] Daily ambient O3 levels in the United Kingdom rarely exceed 100 ppb, at which concentration significant decrements in lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC); forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); mean forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of FVC (FEF25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c75); airway resistance (RAW)) have been observed at an exercise intensity equating to a V\u00cc\u2021e of 70.0 litres/min. [3] Figure 3 shows monthly statistics for O3 in 1997. [4] As expected, O3 levels were higher in the summer than the winter. [5] In large hot cities such as Los Angeles, a diurnal pattern of O3 concentration is observed, peaking around midday well after the morning rush hour and when solar radiation is at its highest. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to respiratory physiology through its potential effects on pulmonary function. While the text primarily discusses ozone (O3) and its impact on lung function, it implies that indoor air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, can pose serious risks to respiratory health, particularly in poorly ventilated environments. However, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and respiratory physiology is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is mentioned in the context of air quality and respiratory health, but there is no direct discussion of its specific effects on respiratory physiology.",
