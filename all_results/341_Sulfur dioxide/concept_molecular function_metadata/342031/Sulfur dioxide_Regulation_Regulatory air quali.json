    "context": "However in many Turkish cities the concentration of these pollutants were known to be above these limits. National legislation also regulates the 8-month winter period urban air quality as 250 \u03bcg/m3 for SO2 and 200 \u03bcg/m3 for PM (MOE 1986). Table 1 summarizes the air quality limits according to this regulation, its probable revision, WHO (Europe-1996) guidelines, and EC regulations (Leeuwen, 1997). Turkish Air Quality Protection Regulation was based on WHO (Europe-1996) air quality criteria which suggests use of SO2 limits of 500 \u03bcg/m3 (10-min average), 125 \u03bcg/m3 (24-h average), 50 \u03bcg/m3 (annual average). For PM new WHO criteria does not propose any guideline. To estimate the amount of past, present, and future pollutant, an emission inventory to cover Turkey was prepared. Methods used for preparing this inventory was similar to the method used in the GENEMIS subproject (EUROTRAC, 1991) of EUROTRAC (EUREKA) project of the European Community. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is directly linked to regulatory measures concerning air quality in Turkish cities. The national legislation sets specific concentration limits for SO2, indicating a structured approach to managing air pollution. The regulation outlines permissible levels for SO2 during different time frames, reflecting the importance of controlling this pollutant to protect public health and comply with international guidelines.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and regulation, as the context provides specific legal limits for SO2 concentrations, demonstrating a clear regulatory framework aimed at managing air quality and public health.",
        "score": 4
