    "context": "Measurements were made with acidimetric titration for SO2 and refractometric evaluations on 24-hr integrated dust filter samples in accordance with WHO-recommended measurement methods. According to these statistics, annual averages for SO2 and PM in the most crowded three metropolitan cities in Turkey between the years 1986 and 1996 were tabulated in Table 8 . Number of monitoring stations were 17 in Istanbul, 10 in Ankara, 9 in Izmir. According to Table 8 air quality on an annual average basis in the three big cities were found to improve towards 1996, although prior to 1992\u20131993 annual average SO2 values were clearly above limits set by the Turkish Regulation for Air Quality Protection. It was found that maximum daily SO2 levels of 762, 299, 491 \u03bcg/m3 and the max daily PM concentrations of 870, 361, 722 \u03bcg/m3 were recorded during the winter months of 1996 in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, respectively. Figs. 1 and 2 show the monthly variations of SO2 and PM for these cities in 1996. Fig. 1 indicates that for SO2 pollution, Ankara was the cleanest. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to air quality measurements and regulatory standards set by Turkish regulations for air quality protection. The data indicates that SO2 levels in major cities were above these limits prior to 1992-1993, highlighting the importance of regulation in managing air quality and reducing pollution levels over time. The improvement in air quality by 1996 suggests that regulatory measures may have been effective in controlling SO2 emissions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and regulation, as the context discusses how SO2 levels were monitored and compared against regulatory limits, indicating the role of regulation in managing air quality.",
        "score": 4
