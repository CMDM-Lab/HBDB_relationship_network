    "context": "The production of H2S was evaluated in function of yeast streak browning. After 24h at 26\u00b0C, fresh yeast cells streaked on this medium assume different browning degree in function of their capacity to produce H2S. The following codes were used: S, Snow; W, White; H, Hazelnut; B, Brown; R, Rust; C, Coffee (S=lowest production level of H2S; C=highest production level of H2S). In grape must fermentations, all S. cerevisiae strains chosen in this study were characterized by a general good fermentation performance, reaching very similar levels of CO2 evolution and sugar exhaustion (the residual sugars ranged from 1 to 1.5%). All the strains exhibited a high fermentation power, producing about 18g CO2/100ml of grape must.Analysis of volatile compounds by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) The first step of this work was to optimize the condition for extraction of aromatic compounds of experimental wines obtained by inoculating the 36 S. cerevisiae strains. Optimal condition of extraction was obtained using the following procedure: 20ml of wine were transferred to a 25ml vial. Our target was to find the best conditions able to determine the largest number of volatile compounds, without saturation of the fiber. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to the evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the fermentation process of grape must by Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. While the study focuses on the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and CO2 evolution, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly discussed in terms of its role or impact on the evolutionary processes of the yeast or the fermentation dynamics. Thus, the relationship is more about the fermentation environment rather than a direct connection between sulfur dioxide and evolutionary processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is part of the fermentation context but lacks a detailed discussion of its relationship with evolutionary processes. The mention of CO2 evolution suggests a broader fermentation process but does not establish a significant link to sulfur dioxide.",
        "score": 2
