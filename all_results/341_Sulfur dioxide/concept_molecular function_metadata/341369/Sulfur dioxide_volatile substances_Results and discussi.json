    "context": "Decanal was formed by 45% of \u201cSouthern\u201d yeasts, while \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts didn't form this compound. As regards ketones, 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone were recovered in 45% and in 35% of wine samples produced by \u201cSouthern\u201d Italy strains, respectively, and in 37.5% and in 25% of wine samples obtained with \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts, respectively (Fig.\u00a01). Other aromatic compounds were determined in low amounts both in wines produced by S. cerevisiae \u201cSouthern\u201d and \u201cNorthern\u201d yeasts (Table 1). In summary, S. cerevisiae isolated from Southern Italy grapes were able to produce more volatile compounds than those from Northern Italy. Consequently, yeasts from South Italy can produce potentially more complex wines from a specific must. During fermentation all yeasts produced ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and ethyl acetate. Also, the production of acids during the alcoholic fermentation was a characteristic of \u201cSouthern Italy\u201d strains. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the production of volatile substances by different yeast strains during fermentation. The focus is on the volatile compounds produced, such as decanal, ketones, and other aromatic compounds, which are significant in wine complexity. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking to preserve volatile compounds, its direct relationship with the volatile substances produced by the yeasts is not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is typically associated with the preservation of volatile substances in winemaking, but there is no direct discussion of its role or interaction with the volatile compounds produced by the yeasts in this context.",
