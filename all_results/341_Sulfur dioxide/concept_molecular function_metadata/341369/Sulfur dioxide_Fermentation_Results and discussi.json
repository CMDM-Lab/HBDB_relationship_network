    "context": "Fig.\u00a02 reports Ward's method hierarchical clustering (dendrogram). The dendrogram clearly differentiated the experimental wines in two main groups (A and B); the samples having similar (highly correlated) aroma composition are clustered together. In fact, the group A includes wines characterized by a higher number of secondary compounds; the main percentage of these wines (76.5) was produced by fermentation with S. cerevisiae strains isolated from Southern grapes and only a little percentage by Northern yeasts. The cluster B includes principally wines produced with S. cerevisiae strains isolated from Northern grapes (about 63%) and only 7 wines derived by fermentation with Southern strains; the common characteristic of wines included in this group was the low number of secondary compounds determined in the experimental wines.Technological characterization of S. cerevisiae strains The screening of S. cerevisiae strains for parameters of technological interest, such as resistance to antimicrobial compounds or hydrogen sulphide production, represents a fundamental step in order to select, within a natural population, strains interesting for oenological use. The thirty-six S. cerevisiae strains were tested for the technological parameters chosen and the results, reported in Table 2 , are subdivided in function of isolation area (Northern, Southern) in order to individuate a potential correlation between strain technological characteristics and isolation area. Generally, a similar behaviour among all the strains was recorded for SO2 and ethanol resistance. In fact, all strains exhibited a high resistance to SO2 (the lowest SO2 concentration tolerated was 225mg/l). ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to the technological characterization of S. cerevisiae strains used in wine fermentation. The strains exhibited high resistance to SO2, which is a common additive in winemaking to prevent spoilage and oxidation. The study highlights the importance of SO2 tolerance in selecting yeast strains for fermentation, indicating a significant relationship between SO2 and the fermentation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between sulfur dioxide and fermentation, as the context discusses the resistance of yeast strains to SO2, which is crucial for their application in winemaking. This relationship is supported by evidence of strain selection based on SO2 tolerance.",
