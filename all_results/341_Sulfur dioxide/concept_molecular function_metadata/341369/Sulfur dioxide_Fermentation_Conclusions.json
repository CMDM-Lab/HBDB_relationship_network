    "context": "Therefore, these yeasts can be considered as unsuitable strains for technological use as starter cultures. From the technological point of view F9 can be considered as the most interesting phenotype, being characterized by strains possessing high resistance to the three antimicrobial compounds and low H2S production. This phenotype was exhibited only among few strains, all isolated from grapes collected in the Northern Italy. Taking into account that the S. cerevisiae strain represents one of the primary parameters affecting wine fermentative volatile composition, the strain-specific aromatic potentiality becomes a selective tool in the choice of the starter that will drive the alcoholic fermentation. In the context of our work, the use of the SPME for the analysis of VOC resulted a suitable and applicative method to highlight the differences in the aromatic potentiality of indigenous S. cerevisiae wine strains. Taking into account that the different aromatic profile is potentially determined by must precursors, the parameter \u201cnumber of VOC\u201d produced can represent a useful tool to select the starter culture in function of the grape must composition. In particular, the VOC profile allowed to find a great variability among wild wine yeasts, emphasizing the potential role of this parameter as trait for starter culture selection. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to fermentation through its role in winemaking, where it is often used as an antimicrobial agent to control unwanted microbial activity during the fermentation process. The study discusses the selection of yeast strains for alcoholic fermentation, emphasizing the importance of strain-specific characteristics in producing desirable volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as a direct factor in the fermentation process, its relevance lies in its common use in managing fermentation conditions and preserving wine quality.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and fermentation. While SO2 is a common additive in winemaking to control fermentation, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific roles of SO2 in the fermentation process itself.",
