    "context": "The strains were differentiated on the basis of parameters of technological interest, such as resistance to antimicrobial compounds frequently present in wine, and the production of volatile aromatic compounds (VOC), determined by SPME procedure in the experimental wines obtained by inoculated fermentations. Yeast strains Thirty-six S. cerevisiae strains, belonging to the collection of Wine Yeast Laboratory of the Basilicata University and isolated from grape varieties coming from two different geographical areas of Italy, were used. The strains coded by 1\u201320 numbers were isolated from Aglianico del Vulture grape variety (Southern Italy), whereas strains coded by 21 until 36 number were isolated from Trebbiano and Sangiovese grape varieties (Northern Italy). All strains were grown at 25\u00b0C on YEPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract; 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) and maintained at 4\u00b0C.Inoculated fermentations The thirty-six wild S. cerevisiae yeasts were tested in inoculated fermentation in order to determine the strain capacity to produce secondary compounds. Fermentations were carried out in 130-ml Erlenmeyer flasks filled with 100ml of red grape must (autoclaved at 100\u00b0C for 20min), characterized by 21% (w/v) fermentable sugars, 0.70 titratable acidity, pH 3.15. The fermentation tests were carried out in duplicate. Each sample was inoculated with 104 cells/ml from a pre-culture grown for 48h in the same grape must. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not explicitly mentioned, but it is commonly used in winemaking to inhibit unwanted microbial growth and oxidation during fermentation. The study focuses on the fermentation process of various S. cerevisiae yeast strains isolated from different grape varieties, assessing their ability to produce volatile aromatic compounds. While SO2 plays a crucial role in fermentation, its specific relationship with the fermentation process in this study is not directly addressed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and fermentation. Although SO2 is a critical component in winemaking and fermentation processes, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific roles of SO2 in the fermentation being studied.",
