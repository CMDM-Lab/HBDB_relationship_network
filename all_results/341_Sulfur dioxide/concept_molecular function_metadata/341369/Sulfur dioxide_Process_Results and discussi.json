    "context": "At this purpose we used both different exposition times of the fiber to the headspace and different temperatures. Furthermore, the analytical conditions (column, oven temperature, temperature raising rate) were selected in order to obtain the best resolution of the peaks. The vial was sealed and headspace extraction was performed for 20min at 25\u00b0C with a 100\u03bcm PDMS fiber, keeping the sample under continuous stirring. By this analysis, the experimental wines yielded different levels of the relative peak areas related to the volatile organic compounds (VOC), in function of the different S. cerevisiae strain which performed the fermentation process. In Table 1 , the compounds with area % less than 0.1 were not reported. In particular, by examining the data for each strain, it was found a considerable variability in relative amounts of total alcohols, which ranged from 34.5% to 83.8%. No significant differences for this parameter were found among the experimental wines produced by S. cerevisiae Southern and Northern strains. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to the fermentation process involving different strains of S. cerevisiae. While the analysis focuses on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during fermentation, sulfur dioxide is commonly used as a preservative and antioxidant in winemaking. However, the specific role of sulfur dioxide in the fermentation process is not explicitly discussed, limiting the depth of the relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between sulfur dioxide and the fermentation process. They share a general context in winemaking, but the relationship lacks detailed exploration or evidence of interaction within the provided context.",
