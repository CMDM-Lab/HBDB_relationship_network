    "context": "[2] Sensitivity analyses were repeated among the children residing at their current address for \u00e2\u2030\u00a58 yrs (n = 2,834), and among those residing at their current address since birth (n = 2,213). [1] Marginal models were applied to assess the associations between exposure to each air pollutant and health outcomes, in order to take into account the potential non-independence of data for children living in the same community. [2] The parameters of the marginal models were estimated by the generalised estimating equation approach using SAS PROC GENMOD (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) with an exchangeable working correlation structure using the community as a stratum. [3] The models were adjusted for age, sex, older siblings, family history of allergy, parental education, mother's ethnic origin and potential sources of indoor pollution at home (smoking, mould or dampness, natural gas used for heating, cooking or water-heater, and pets). [4] Details on the selection of adjustment factors including the study of the interactions between potential modifiers and air pollutants are available in the supplementary material. [5] All odds ratios (ORs) are presented against interquartile range increases in air pollution concentrations. [1] Statistical significance was assessed using a two-sided test at a 5% level of significance. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is mentioned as an air pollutant potentially linked to health outcomes, including hypersensitivity reactions. The study assesses the associations between exposure to various air pollutants and health effects in children, suggesting that sulfur dioxide exposure may contribute to allergic responses or hypersensitivity, although specific interactions are not detailed in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is associated with hypersensitivity in the context of air pollution and health outcomes, but the specific mechanisms or direct evidence of this relationship are not elaborated upon in the text.",
