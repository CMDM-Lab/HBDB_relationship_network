    "context": "[3] 2) Reported symptoms during the last 12 months: asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema in the last 1 yr. [4] 3) Reported diagnosis during life: lifetime asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema. [5] The methods used to assess the six reported outcomes through the replies to the ISAAC questions  are briefly summarised in the supplementary material. [1] Long-term exposure of the 6,683 children for whom complete health data were available (refer to the supplementary material for details on the participation rate) was assessed through 3-yr averaged (from 1998 to 2000) concentrations of major urban air pollutants (benzene, volatile organic compounds (VOC), SO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10), NO2, NOx and CO), estimated through the validated STREET 5 software (Targeting, Versailles, France), at the 108 school addresses. [2] Home addresses were not available. [1] The implemented methods, as described previously , are briefly summarised below. [2] To obtain annual mean concentrations of air pollutants, STREET, which is based on a dispersion model, combines data on both a regional component (background air pollution) and a local component, which depends on both traffic emissions and local dispersion conditions (topography and meteorology) in the modelled street segment (refer to supplementary material).

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed for long-term exposure among children. The term 'targeting' refers to the methods used to estimate air pollutant concentrations at school addresses through the STREET software, which models both regional and local pollution sources. While SO2 is part of the pollutants being targeted for assessment, there is no direct relationship established between SO2 and the concept of targeting beyond its inclusion in the air quality evaluation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sulfur dioxide is included in the assessment of air pollutants targeted for health impact studies, but there is no detailed discussion of how targeting specifically relates to SO2 beyond its mention in the context.",
