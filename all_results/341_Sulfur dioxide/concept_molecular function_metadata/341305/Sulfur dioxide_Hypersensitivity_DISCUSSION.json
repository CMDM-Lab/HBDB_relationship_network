    "context": "[2] However, the rank order of the 3-yr averaged concentrations calculated at schools is likely to have remained stable over the lifetimes of these children, due to the fact that no major road works were undertaken in the six communities between 1990 and 2000, although there may have been some changes in the absolute traffic density. [3] Thus, the fact that the associations of benzene and PM10 with asthma, and of VOC and PM10 with sensitisation to pollens, remained robust among the children who had never moved argues in favour of an effect of these pollutants on asthma and allergies. [4] However, distinguishing new incident asthma from a recrudescence of previous symptoms remains difficult, except in birth cohort. [5] In a Dutch birth cohort, NO2, particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 \u00c2\u00b5m and soot modelled through a regression model were associated with some outcomes of asthma and allergy during the first 4 yrs of life . [1] To conclude, our study showed associations between long-term exposure to urban air pollution, assessed using a dispersion model capable of capturing small-scale variations within communities, and asthma and allergies. [2] The most robust associations were found with PM10 and benzene, primarily emitted by traffic in urban areas. [3] These results corroborate an emerging body of evidence that traffic-related air pollution could induce asthma and allergies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to hypersensitivity through its association with urban air pollution and respiratory conditions like asthma and allergies. While sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as a direct cause of hypersensitivity, the broader discussion of air pollutants, including particulate matter and volatile organic compounds, suggests a potential link to increased sensitivity and allergic responses in children exposed to these pollutants over time.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as sulfur dioxide is part of the broader context of air pollution that is associated with hypersensitivity and respiratory issues, but there is no direct evidence or specific mention of sulfur dioxide's role in hypersensitivity within the provided context.",
