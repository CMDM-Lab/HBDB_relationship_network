    "context": "[2] a) Lifetime asthma, b) asthma in the last 1 yr and c) sensitisation to pollens. [3] A: 4,907 children residing at their current address for \u00e2\u2030\u00a53 yrs; B: 2,834 children residing at their current address for \u00e2\u2030\u00a58 yrs; C: 2,213 children residing at their current address since birth. [4] VOC: volatile organic compounds; PM10: particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00ce\u00bcm. [5] Data are presented as OR and 95% CI obtained with a marginal model adjusted for age, sex, older siblings, family history of allergy, parental education, mother's ethnic origin, smoking at home, mould or dampness at home, natural gas used for heating, cooking or for water-heater at home, and pets at home, with an exchangeable working correlation structure using the community as a stratum. [6] OR were calculated per increment for the interquartile range (1.1 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193, 25.2 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193, 5 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193, 10.5 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193, 18.5 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193, 52.1 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 and 199 \u00ce\u00bcg\u00c2\u00b7m\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 for benzene, VOC, SO2, PM10, NO2, NOx and CO, respectively) successively among children in group A, B and C. The whiskers extend to the lower bound and the upper bound of the 95% CI (\u00c3\u2014: adjusted OR). [1] For children residing at their current address for \u00e2\u2030\u00a53 yrs, the risk for suffering from asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis and sensitisation to pollens was significantly higher in neighbourhoods of schools with higher concentrations of some of the major urban pollutants, mainly influenced by traffic emissions. [2] The associations of lifetime asthma with benzene and PM10 are particularly robust because they remain significant even among children residing at their current address since birth. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the urban pollutants associated with increased risks of asthma and hypersensitivity in children. The study indicates that children living in areas with higher concentrations of SO2, along with other pollutants, have a significantly higher risk of developing asthma and allergic conditions, suggesting a direct link between SO2 exposure and hypersensitivity responses in susceptible populations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between sulfur dioxide and hypersensitivity, as the context provides evidence of increased asthma and allergic reactions in children exposed to higher SO2 levels, indicating a clear relationship within the study's findings.",
        "score": 4
