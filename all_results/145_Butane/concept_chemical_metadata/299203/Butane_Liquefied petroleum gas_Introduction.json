    "context": "2 Although experimentation with products containing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (including glues, gasoline, paints, adhesives, varnishes, paint removers) and halogenated hydrocarbons (such as dry cleaning agents, spray paints, nail polish removers, typewriter correction fluids, aerosolized foods and propellants) among younger adolescents is a common practice seen globally in the last decades, it has been recognized since the early 1900s in Western countries. 3 Inhalants that are commonly abused in order to get \u201chigh\u201d contain substances like toluene, butane, propane, fluorocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons or acetone. 2 Lethal intoxication is more accidental than suicidal by causing death through several mechanisms: suffocation, trauma after dangerous behavior, vagal inhibition, respiratory depression and \u201csudden-sniffing death syndrome\u201d following cardiac arrhythmia 4\u20138 which becomes the cause of death in as many as 50 percent of inhalant-related deaths. 4 The release of a burst of catecholamines that can trigger ventricular fibrillation at the start of inhalant abuse, according to some authors, causes the sudden sniffing death syndrome. 1 Butane \u2013 CH3(CH2)2CH3 (synonyms: n-butane, butyl hydride, methylethyl-methane), a liquefied petroleum gas with LC50 of 658\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123, belongs to a class of aliphatic hydrocarbons which is commonly found in lighter fluid, fuel, spray paint, hair spray, room freshener, deodorants. Frostbite due to rapid cooling on evaporation occurs if butane is used in a liquid state, but most commonly it is abused as a gaseous propellant in an inhalant and acts as a simple asphyxiant causing toxicity by displacing oxygen and preventing it from reaching important tissues and organs. 9 Our report covers two cases of sudden death occurring after the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing only butane. Most reports regard accidental inhalation of a mixture of n-propane, n-butane and isobutane, while only five reported fatal outcomes caused by the intentional inhalation of either n-butane or isobutane.

        "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a specific type of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which is commonly used in products like lighter fluid and aerosol sprays. The text discusses the dangers associated with inhaling butane, highlighting its classification as an aliphatic hydrocarbon and its role as a propellant. The relationship is clear as butane is a component of LPG, and both are associated with inhalant abuse and toxicity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butane and liquefied petroleum gas, as butane is explicitly described as a type of LPG. The context provides details on its uses and associated health risks, indicating a strong relationship.",
