    "context": "Fibrinogen showed an exactly opposite reaction. Interestingly, CC9 was not considered to be positive either, although in Case 1 there was some reaction of large areas of infarcted cells but it was rather weak and membranous suggesting earliest deposition. In Case 2 CC9 stained only disseminated single cells (Figs. 3 and 4 ). It is a paradoxical but well known fact that halogenated hydrocarbons commonly known by their trademark name, Freon, also capable of causing death 4 by induction of cardiac arrhythmias, 3 were regularly found as propellants of aerosol cans deliberately used for getting \u201chigh\u201d until the nineteen-seventies when they were replaced by non-halogenated hydrocarbons such as butanpropane, n-butane, isobutane, and isopentane because of the protection of the earth ozone layer. 8 In the following years several reports discussed patients who accidentally 11 or deliberately 10 inhaled butane and survived thanks to intensive medical care or CPR, or died in spite of it. 6,8 The mechanism of death was explained by epinephrine-induced cardiac arrhythmias caused by acute inhalation of high concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons considered to be otherwise safe. In the past few decades, according to published reports, inhalation of butane became a fairly frequent cause of death especially in young adolecents 1,6,8 or in elders due to autoerotic abuse. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane and isopentane are mentioned as non-halogenated hydrocarbons that replaced halogenated hydrocarbons like Freon in aerosol propellants due to environmental concerns. Both compounds are discussed in relation to their potential health risks when inhaled, particularly in cases of abuse or accidental exposure, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as butane and isopentane are categorized together as hydrocarbons used in aerosol propellants, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or specific interactions in the context provided.",
