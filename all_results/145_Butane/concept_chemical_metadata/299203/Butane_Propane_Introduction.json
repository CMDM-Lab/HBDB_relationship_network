    "context": "1 Butane \u2013 CH3(CH2)2CH3 (synonyms: n-butane, butyl hydride, methylethyl-methane), a liquefied petroleum gas with LC50 of 658\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123, belongs to a class of aliphatic hydrocarbons which is commonly found in lighter fluid, fuel, spray paint, hair spray, room freshener, deodorants. Frostbite due to rapid cooling on evaporation occurs if butane is used in a liquid state, but most commonly it is abused as a gaseous propellant in an inhalant and acts as a simple asphyxiant causing toxicity by displacing oxygen and preventing it from reaching important tissues and organs. 9 Our report covers two cases of sudden death occurring after the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing only butane. Most reports regard accidental inhalation of a mixture of n-propane, n-butane and isobutane, while only five reported fatal outcomes caused by the intentional inhalation of either n-butane or isobutane. 1,8,10 Histological, immunohistochemical as well as toxicological analyses were performed. The dead body of a 25-year-old male, 181\u00a0cm high, appropriately nourished, was found lying supine in an abandoned restaurant. A\u00a0tin lighter refill was found next to the body. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are both identified as aliphatic hydrocarbons commonly found in products like lighter fluid and aerosol sprays. The text discusses the toxicological implications of butane inhalation, particularly in cases of abuse, while mentioning that accidental inhalation often involves a mixture of butane, propane, and isobutane. However, the relationship between butane and propane is not explored in detail beyond their classification as similar hydrocarbons used in similar applications.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as butane and propane are mentioned together in the context of inhalation toxicity and their common uses, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship detailed between the two compounds.",
