    "context": "Fibrinogen showed an exactly opposite reaction. Interestingly, CC9 was not considered to be positive either, although in Case 1 there was some reaction of large areas of infarcted cells but it was rather weak and membranous suggesting earliest deposition. In Case 2 CC9 stained only disseminated single cells (Figs. 3 and 4 ). It is a paradoxical but well known fact that halogenated hydrocarbons commonly known by their trademark name, Freon, also capable of causing death 4 by induction of cardiac arrhythmias, 3 were regularly found as propellants of aerosol cans deliberately used for getting \u201chigh\u201d until the nineteen-seventies when they were replaced by non-halogenated hydrocarbons such as butanpropane, n-butane, isobutane, and isopentane because of the protection of the earth ozone layer. 8 In the following years several reports discussed patients who accidentally 11 or deliberately 10 inhaled butane and survived thanks to intensive medical care or CPR, or died in spite of it. 6,8 The mechanism of death was explained by epinephrine-induced cardiac arrhythmias caused by acute inhalation of high concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons considered to be otherwise safe. In the past few decades, according to published reports, inhalation of butane became a fairly frequent cause of death especially in young adolecents 1,6,8 or in elders due to autoerotic abuse. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned as a non-halogenated hydrocarbon that replaced halogenated hydrocarbons like Freon due to environmental concerns regarding ozone layer depletion. The text discusses the health risks associated with butane inhalation, particularly its potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. However, the relationship with ozone is primarily environmental, focusing on the shift in propellant use to protect the ozone layer rather than a direct interaction between butane and ozone.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between butane and ozone, as they are related through environmental regulations and health implications, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct interaction or specific relevance in the context.",
