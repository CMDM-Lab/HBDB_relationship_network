    "context": "Rigor mortis and post mortem lividity were not yet pronounced. Autopsy Both autopsies were performed in the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Medical School in Zagreb within 24\u00a0h of the ascertained time of death. In either case autopsy did not disclose any pre-existing pathological substrate as a possible cause of death, and suspicion regarding the involvement of a third person was not confirmed. Therefore, tissue, biological fluids, gastric contents, nose swab and pubic hair samples were taken for extensive chemical\u2013toxicological analysis: 1) in order to determine the blood and urine level of ethyl alcohol; 2) blood, urine, bile, liver, kidney, gastric content, nose swab and pubic hair samples were analyzed toxicologically for the possible presence of drugs, poison or opiates; 3) because of specific death-related circumstances, that is, of\u00a0the butane lighter refills found on police investigation next to the bodies, and considering the absence of macroscopic elements which could be used to establish a cause-and-effect link with death, the butane refills were analyzed, and biological brain, lung, blood and urine samples taken.Chemical\u2013toxicological analysis Blood and urine samples, bile liquid, and liver and kidney tissue were analyzed by the extraction technique on an XAD-2 resin column. The nose swab, the pubic hair sample and the gastric content were extracted with organic solvents. Headspace gas chromatography was used was used to analyze blood, urine (there was no urine in case 2), brain and lung samples. The analysis was performed on a PE AutoSystem Gas Chromatograph with a PE TurboMatrix 40 Headspace Sampler, under the following conditions: column 15%; Hallcomid M-18; O1/Chromosorb; W-HP 80/100 Mesch; column temperature 75\u00a0\u00b0C; injector temperature 120\u00a0\u00b0C; detector temperature 130\u00a0\u00b0C; vial temperature 60\u00a0\u00b0C; transferline temperature 90\u00a0\u00b0C; carrier gas N2: 4\u00a0ml/min.

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned as a substance related to the investigation of potential causes of death, specifically in connection with butane lighter refills found at the scene. XAD-2 resin is utilized as an extraction medium in the chemical-toxicological analysis of various biological samples. The relationship between butane and XAD-2 resin is indirect, as the resin is used to extract and analyze substances, including butane, from biological samples, but no direct interaction or specific relevance between the two is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as butane is analyzed using XAD-2 resin in the context of toxicological investigations. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or significant interaction, making it a general association rather than a direct one.",
        "score": 2
