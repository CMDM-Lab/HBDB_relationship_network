    "context": "The intentional inhalation of a volatile substance is an underrecognized form of substance abuse in children and adolescents. 1 Inhalant abuse involves inhaling in a substance directly from its container (\u201csniffing\u201d or \u201csnorting\u201d), placing a rag soaked in the substance over the nose and mouth and inhaling (\u201chuffing\u201d), or pouring the substance into a plastic bag and breathing the fumes (\u201cbagging\u201d). 2 Although experimentation with products containing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (including glues, gasoline, paints, adhesives, varnishes, paint removers) and halogenated hydrocarbons (such as dry cleaning agents, spray paints, nail polish removers, typewriter correction fluids, aerosolized foods and propellants) among younger adolescents is a common practice seen globally in the last decades, it has been recognized since the early 1900s in Western countries. 3 Inhalants that are commonly abused in order to get \u201chigh\u201d contain substances like toluene, butane, propane, fluorocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons or acetone. 2 Lethal intoxication is more accidental than suicidal by causing death through several mechanisms: suffocation, trauma after dangerous behavior, vagal inhibition, respiratory depression and \u201csudden-sniffing death syndrome\u201d following cardiac arrhythmia 4\u20138 which becomes the cause of death in as many as 50 percent of inhalant-related deaths. 4 The release of a burst of catecholamines that can trigger ventricular fibrillation at the start of inhalant abuse, according to some authors, causes the sudden sniffing death syndrome. 1 Butane \u2013 CH3(CH2)2CH3 (synonyms: n-butane, butyl hydride, methylethyl-methane), a liquefied petroleum gas with LC50 of 658\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123, belongs to a class of aliphatic hydrocarbons which is commonly found in lighter fluid, fuel, spray paint, hair spray, room freshener, deodorants. Frostbite due to rapid cooling on evaporation occurs if butane is used in a liquid state, but most commonly it is abused as a gaseous propellant in an inhalant and acts as a simple asphyxiant causing toxicity by displacing oxygen and preventing it from reaching important tissues and organs.

        "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as an aliphatic hydrocarbon that is commonly abused as an inhalant, alongside other hydrocarbons and chlorinated compounds. The text discusses the dangers of inhalant abuse, which includes substances like butane and chlorinated hydrocarbons, highlighting their classification and the health risks associated with their inhalation. However, the relationship is primarily categorical, as both butane and chlorinated hydrocarbons are mentioned as substances involved in inhalant abuse without a detailed interaction between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as butane is categorized as a hydrocarbon and is mentioned alongside chlorinated hydrocarbons in the context of inhalant abuse. While they share a commonality in being substances of abuse, the specific interactions or comparative effects are not elaborated upon.",
