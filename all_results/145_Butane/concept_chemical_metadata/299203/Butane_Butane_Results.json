    "context": "Nose and pubic hair swabs contained no traces of drugs, medicaments and/or their metabolites. The presence of butane in blood, urine, lung and brain samples was conformed by headspace chromatography Fig. 2a. Blood samples obtained from Case 2 contained 0.00\u00a0g/kg of absolute alcohol, and caffeine in bodily fluids and tissues, and nose and pubic hair swabs; no traces of drugs, medicaments and/or their metabolites were found. Headspace chromatography confirmed the presence of butane in blood, lung and brain samples Fig.\u00a02b).Histology Pathohistological analysis discovered an almost identical morphology in both cases. Lung samples were characterized by diffuse intraalveolar haemorrhagic edema with activation of macrophages and erythrophagia. There were also intraalveolarly located uncolored \u201cblebs\u201d resembling those seen in the lungs of drowned persons. In addition to this, occasional intracapillar and endothelial \u201cblebs\u201d were detected, causing total obstruction of the capillar lumen. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned multiple times as a substance detected in various biological samples, including blood, urine, lung, and brain. The presence of butane is confirmed through headspace chromatography, indicating its significance in the analysis of the samples. However, there is no discussion of different roles or interactions of butane, as it is consistently referred to in the same context without differentiation.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between the mentions of butane, as it is simply identified in various samples without any functional or chemical interaction discussed. The references are coincidental rather than indicative of a significant relationship.",
