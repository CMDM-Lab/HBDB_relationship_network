    "context": "This theory is supported by acute congestion of inner organs found on autopsy. 1 Sugie et\u00a0al. emphasize the anesthetic or narcotic effect of n-butane and isobutane on CNS. This happens because of the lipophilic features of butane which is distributed by blood in lipid-rich tissues such as brain and fat-tissues, and also in the liver, heart, and kidney. 13 Inhalation of hydrocarbons or 0.5\u201315% butane in the air is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, and the sudden surge of this hormone is thought to result in fatal arrythmia, 1,13 probably ventricular fibrillation, immediately after sudden fear or hard muscular exercise such as fright, running and sexual activity. 8,12,14,15\u201317 Summarizing all previously mentioned, hypoxia, respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia are probably three possible mechanisms of sudden death related to volatile abuse of inhalants containing butane. No pathognomonic morphological changes have been detected yet for butane intoxication or sudden death caused by butane or other similar inhalants. Early cardiac death is not only an issue for discussion in forensic medicine, but also a detection problem for the pathologist. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a specific type of hydrocarbon with notable effects on the central nervous system (CNS) due to its lipophilic properties. The inhalation of butane, categorized under hydrocarbons, is linked to serious health risks, including cardiac arrhythmias and potential fatal outcomes. The relationship emphasizes butane's role as a volatile hydrocarbon that can sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, leading to dangerous physiological responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butane and hydrocarbons, as butane is a specific example of a hydrocarbon with documented health effects. The context provides evidence of butane's impact on the CNS and cardiovascular system, indicating a clear relationship within the broader category of hydrocarbons.",
