    "context": "Rigor mortis and post mortem lividity were not yet pronounced. Autopsy Both autopsies were performed in the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Medical School in Zagreb within 24\u00a0h of the ascertained time of death. In either case autopsy did not disclose any pre-existing pathological substrate as a possible cause of death, and suspicion regarding the involvement of a third person was not confirmed. Therefore, tissue, biological fluids, gastric contents, nose swab and pubic hair samples were taken for extensive chemical\u2013toxicological analysis: 1) in order to determine the blood and urine level of ethyl alcohol; 2) blood, urine, bile, liver, kidney, gastric content, nose swab and pubic hair samples were analyzed toxicologically for the possible presence of drugs, poison or opiates; 3) because of specific death-related circumstances, that is, of\u00a0the butane lighter refills found on police investigation next to the bodies, and considering the absence of macroscopic elements which could be used to establish a cause-and-effect link with death, the butane refills were analyzed, and biological brain, lung, blood and urine samples taken.Chemical\u2013toxicological analysis Blood and urine samples, bile liquid, and liver and kidney tissue were analyzed by the extraction technique on an XAD-2 resin column. The nose swab, the pubic hair sample and the gastric content were extracted with organic solvents. Headspace gas chromatography was used was used to analyze blood, urine (there was no urine in case 2), brain and lung samples. The analysis was performed on a PE AutoSystem Gas Chromatograph with a PE TurboMatrix 40 Headspace Sampler, under the following conditions: column 15%; Hallcomid M-18; O1/Chromosorb; W-HP 80/100 Mesch; column temperature 75\u00a0\u00b0C; injector temperature 120\u00a0\u00b0C; detector temperature 130\u00a0\u00b0C; vial temperature 60\u00a0\u00b0C; transferline temperature 90\u00a0\u00b0C; carrier gas N2: 4\u00a0ml/min.

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned in relation to a forensic investigation involving chemical-toxicological analysis. However, the term 'elements' is not specifically defined or connected to butane within the provided text. The analysis focuses on the presence of butane in lighter refills found at the scene, but does not elaborate on its elemental composition or any direct relationship to the broader category of elements in chemistry.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as butane is part of the chemical analysis, but there is no detailed discussion of its relationship to elements or their significance in the context.",
