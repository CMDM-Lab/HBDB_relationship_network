    "context": "1 Butane \u2013 CH3(CH2)2CH3 (synonyms: n-butane, butyl hydride, methylethyl-methane), a liquefied petroleum gas with LC50 of 658\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123, belongs to a class of aliphatic hydrocarbons which is commonly found in lighter fluid, fuel, spray paint, hair spray, room freshener, deodorants. Frostbite due to rapid cooling on evaporation occurs if butane is used in a liquid state, but most commonly it is abused as a gaseous propellant in an inhalant and acts as a simple asphyxiant causing toxicity by displacing oxygen and preventing it from reaching important tissues and organs. 9 Our report covers two cases of sudden death occurring after the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing only butane. Most reports regard accidental inhalation of a mixture of n-propane, n-butane and isobutane, while only five reported fatal outcomes caused by the intentional inhalation of either n-butane or isobutane. 1,8,10 Histological, immunohistochemical as well as toxicological analyses were performed. The dead body of a 25-year-old male, 181\u00a0cm high, appropriately nourished, was found lying supine in an abandoned restaurant. A\u00a0tin lighter refill was found next to the body. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed as a liquefied petroleum gas with various applications, including use in lighter fluid and as a propellant. The text highlights the toxic effects of butane, particularly when inhaled, leading to asphyxiation and potential fatal outcomes. The mention of butane in different forms (n-butane, isobutane) emphasizes its relevance in toxicological cases, particularly in instances of abuse and accidental inhalation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship, as the context discusses the toxicological implications of butane, including its role in fatal incidents. The detailed examination of butane's effects on health and its classification as a simple asphyxiant underscores its significance.",
