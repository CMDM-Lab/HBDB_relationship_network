    "context": "However, it is necessary to carry out more specific studies on reactivity in the MCMA atmosphere. Based on a study carried out in Mexico City in 1993, Blake and Rowland (1995) recommended that the formulation of the LP gas be changed to one with a higher concentration of propane, which has a lower reactivity than butane. From the results of this study, this recommendation is further supported. It is necessary to carry out specific experimental studies on ozone formation by testing several mixtures of propane/butane (LP gas), and on that basis, to propose a formulation for this fuel that improves the air quality of the MCMA. On the other hand, it is also necessary to establish control measurements in order to diminish leakage of LP gas and its components into the atmosphere. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by rhizospheric bacteria play an important role in plant-bacterial interactions and their impact on plants has been well-documented (Ryu et al., 2003; Bhattacharyya and Jha, 2012; Bailly and Weisskopf, 2012; Bitas et al., 2013). The first report of bacterial VOCs affecting plants was the in vitro induction of leaf necrosis by bacterial VOCs (Cook and Stall, 1969), but it was the discovery of bacterial VOCs promoting growth in Arabidopsis thaliana that stimulated active research in this area (Ryu et al., 2003).

        "summary": "In this context, butane and ozone are indirectly related through discussions on air quality and the reactivity of LP gas components. The study suggests that changing the formulation of LP gas to include more propane, which is less reactive than butane, could help reduce ozone formation in the atmosphere. However, the specific interaction between butane and ozone is not deeply explored, focusing instead on the broader implications for air quality improvement.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between butane and ozone, as they are discussed in the context of air quality and reactivity, but there is no detailed examination of their direct relationship or interactions.",
