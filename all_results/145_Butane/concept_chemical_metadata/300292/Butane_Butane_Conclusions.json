    "context": "However, it is necessary to carry out more specific studies on reactivity in the MCMA atmosphere. Based on a study carried out in Mexico City in 1993, Blake and Rowland (1995) recommended that the formulation of the LP gas be changed to one with a higher concentration of propane, which has a lower reactivity than butane. From the results of this study, this recommendation is further supported. It is necessary to carry out specific experimental studies on ozone formation by testing several mixtures of propane/butane (LP gas), and on that basis, to propose a formulation for this fuel that improves the air quality of the MCMA. On the other hand, it is also necessary to establish control measurements in order to diminish leakage of LP gas and its components into the atmosphere. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by rhizospheric bacteria play an important role in plant-bacterial interactions and their impact on plants has been well-documented (Ryu et al., 2003; Bhattacharyya and Jha, 2012; Bailly and Weisskopf, 2012; Bitas et al., 2013). The first report of bacterial VOCs affecting plants was the in vitro induction of leaf necrosis by bacterial VOCs (Cook and Stall, 1969), but it was the discovery of bacterial VOCs promoting growth in Arabidopsis thaliana that stimulated active research in this area (Ryu et al., 2003).

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned in relation to its reactivity compared to propane in the formulation of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas) for improving air quality in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The discussion focuses on the need for specific studies on the reactivity of butane and its impact on ozone formation, indicating its significance in environmental chemistry. However, since both mentions refer to the same compound, the relationship is more about its properties rather than an interaction with another distinct entity.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as butane is discussed in terms of its reactivity and environmental implications, but there is no detailed exploration of its relationship with another distinct term or compound.",
