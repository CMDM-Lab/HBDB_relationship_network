    "context": "In order to establish strategies of control and to improve the air quality in the MCMA, it was necessary to identify the sources of NMHC and the mixture of compounds from each of them. Through experimentation, we attempted to determine what types of compounds are the most reactive in ozone production. A previous study carried out by Blake and Rowland (1995) in Mexico City in 1993 showed that the LP gas plays a very important role in urban smog formation due to the high propane/butane concentrations found in MCMA ambient air. In this paper, we investigated which emission source is responsible for the high propane/butane concentration present in the ambient air and contributes to ozone formation. The experiments were of three types: (1) exhaust emissions; (2) evaporative emissions; and (3) ozone formation in smog chambers, which are described next.Exhaust emissions The exhaust emission tests were carried out on a typical automobile of the MCMA, a VW Sedan 1987 model, following either the Federal Test Procedure FTP-74 or the EPA-74, as shown by Schueltzle et al. (1994), which corresponds to the Mexican Official Norm DGN-AA-II-1980. The exhaust gas was collected and analyzed to determine its composition by gas chromatography. The result is the average of three tests carried out on the same vehicle. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a significant contributor to ozone formation in urban smog, particularly in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The study highlights the role of butane, along with propane, in the production of ozone through various emission sources, including exhaust and evaporative emissions. The research aims to understand the reactivity of these compounds in ozone production, indicating a direct relationship between butane emissions and increased ozone levels in the atmosphere.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between butane and ozone, as the context discusses butane's role in ozone formation and its contribution to urban smog. The evidence presented supports the significant impact of butane on ozone levels, although further details on the mechanisms could enhance the score.",
        "score": 4
