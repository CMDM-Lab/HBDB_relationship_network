    "context": "However, it is necessary to carry out more specific studies on reactivity in the MCMA atmosphere. Based on a study carried out in Mexico City in 1993, Blake and Rowland (1995) recommended that the formulation of the LP gas be changed to one with a higher concentration of propane, which has a lower reactivity than butane. From the results of this study, this recommendation is further supported. It is necessary to carry out specific experimental studies on ozone formation by testing several mixtures of propane/butane (LP gas), and on that basis, to propose a formulation for this fuel that improves the air quality of the MCMA. On the other hand, it is also necessary to establish control measurements in order to diminish leakage of LP gas and its components into the atmosphere. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by rhizospheric bacteria play an important role in plant-bacterial interactions and their impact on plants has been well-documented (Ryu et al., 2003; Bhattacharyya and Jha, 2012; Bailly and Weisskopf, 2012; Bitas et al., 2013). The first report of bacterial VOCs affecting plants was the in vitro induction of leaf necrosis by bacterial VOCs (Cook and Stall, 1969), but it was the discovery of bacterial VOCs promoting growth in Arabidopsis thaliana that stimulated active research in this area (Ryu et al., 2003).

        "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are discussed as components of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas) in relation to their reactivity and impact on air quality. The recommendation to increase propane concentration over butane is based on propane's lower reactivity, suggesting a direct relationship where the choice of gas formulation can influence environmental outcomes, particularly ozone formation. This indicates a significant connection between the two gases in terms of their chemical properties and implications for air quality management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butane and propane, as the context discusses their reactivity differences and the implications for air quality. The recommendation to adjust LP gas formulation based on these properties provides strong contextual support for their relationship.",
