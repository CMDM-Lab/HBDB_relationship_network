    "context": "Of this, 98.4% was used as domestic fuel (cooking and water heating) and the 1.6% residual (4 MBD) for carburation. In the metropolitan area, LP gas consumption in the same year was 52.6 MBD, which is 20.6% of the total consumption. Based on these figures, the consumption of gasoline was 209.8% higher than LP gas in the MCMA, but the gasoline light compounds accounted only for the 10% of the total evaporative emissions and emissions from the exhaust. However, the ambient air of the samples analyzed registers a higher quantity of propane than butane, at an average ratio of 1.65, and the only possible source of the propane was LP gas from leaks and incomplete combustion. Exhaust and evaporative emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles introduce a higher concentration of butane than propane. The C3/C4 concentration ratio is always less than 0.5. On the contrary, the concentration of propane present in LP gas is higher than that of butane. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are both discussed as components of liquefied petroleum (LP) gas, with propane being more prevalent in ambient air samples compared to butane. The analysis indicates that while both gases are used as domestic fuels, their emissions and concentrations differ, with propane being more abundant in LP gas and butane being more concentrated in exhaust emissions from fossil fuel combustion. This suggests a relationship based on their usage and environmental presence, but does not delve into their chemical interactions or specific functional roles.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as butane and propane are related through their roles as domestic fuels and their differing concentrations in the environment. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or significant functional relationships between the two gases.",
