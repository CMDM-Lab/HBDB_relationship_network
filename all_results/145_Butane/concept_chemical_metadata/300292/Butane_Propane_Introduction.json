    "context": "In order to establish strategies of control and to improve the air quality in the MCMA, it was necessary to identify the sources of NMHC and the mixture of compounds from each of them. Through experimentation, we attempted to determine what types of compounds are the most reactive in ozone production. A previous study carried out by Blake and Rowland (1995) in Mexico City in 1993 showed that the LP gas plays a very important role in urban smog formation due to the high propane/butane concentrations found in MCMA ambient air. In this paper, we investigated which emission source is responsible for the high propane/butane concentration present in the ambient air and contributes to ozone formation. The experiments were of three types: (1) exhaust emissions; (2) evaporative emissions; and (3) ozone formation in smog chambers, which are described next.Exhaust emissions The exhaust emission tests were carried out on a typical automobile of the MCMA, a VW Sedan 1987 model, following either the Federal Test Procedure FTP-74 or the EPA-74, as shown by Schueltzle et al. (1994), which corresponds to the Mexican Official Norm DGN-AA-II-1980. The exhaust gas was collected and analyzed to determine its composition by gas chromatography. The result is the average of three tests carried out on the same vehicle. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are discussed as components of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas) that significantly contribute to urban smog formation in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The study highlights the high concentrations of propane and butane in ambient air and their role in ozone production, indicating a direct relationship between these two hydrocarbons in terms of their environmental impact and reactivity in smog formation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butane and propane, as both are identified as key contributors to ozone formation in urban air quality studies. Their concentrations and roles in smog formation are quantitatively assessed, demonstrating a clear relationship within the context.",
        "score": 4
