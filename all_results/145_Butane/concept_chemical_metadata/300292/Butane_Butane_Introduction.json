    "context": "In order to establish strategies of control and to improve the air quality in the MCMA, it was necessary to identify the sources of NMHC and the mixture of compounds from each of them. Through experimentation, we attempted to determine what types of compounds are the most reactive in ozone production. A previous study carried out by Blake and Rowland (1995) in Mexico City in 1993 showed that the LP gas plays a very important role in urban smog formation due to the high propane/butane concentrations found in MCMA ambient air. In this paper, we investigated which emission source is responsible for the high propane/butane concentration present in the ambient air and contributes to ozone formation. The experiments were of three types: (1) exhaust emissions; (2) evaporative emissions; and (3) ozone formation in smog chambers, which are described next.Exhaust emissions The exhaust emission tests were carried out on a typical automobile of the MCMA, a VW Sedan 1987 model, following either the Federal Test Procedure FTP-74 or the EPA-74, as shown by Schueltzle et al. (1994), which corresponds to the Mexican Official Norm DGN-AA-II-1980. The exhaust gas was collected and analyzed to determine its composition by gas chromatography. The result is the average of three tests carried out on the same vehicle. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned as a component of the LP gas that contributes to urban smog formation in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The study highlights the importance of butane, along with propane, in the ambient air and its role in ozone production. However, the relationship is not elaborated upon beyond its identification as a reactive compound in smog formation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as butane is identified as part of a mixture contributing to air quality issues, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or effects beyond its presence in the context of urban smog.",
        "score": 2
