    "context": "The tests included samples taken from emissions from fuel storage tanks, and the manifold and the fuel feeding system of a motor vehicle. The test consisted of introducing the vehicle to the SHED hut immediately after concluding the FTP-74 test and recording the temperature and concentration of hydrocarbons every minute for 1 h. Three tests of this type were carried out.Ozone-formation smog chambers This experiment was carried out in smog chambers between 3 and 23 April 1995. The experiments determined both the maximum ozone and propane/butane initial concentrations. These captive air irradiation [CAI] type experiments are similar to those described by Kelly and Gunst (1990) and Gunst and Kelly (1993). These experiments were carried out at the Mexican Petroleum Institute, which is close to industrial areas with pollutant sources and is located in the trajectory of the prevailing winds. The IMP also had facilities to monitor ozone, nitrogen oxides, oxides of sulfur and carbon monoxide. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned multiple times in relation to emissions testing from fuel storage tanks and vehicle systems. The experiments focus on measuring concentrations of hydrocarbons, including butane, in the atmosphere and their role in ozone formation. However, the relationship is not elaborated upon beyond its presence in the emissions being studied.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as butane is mentioned in the context of emissions testing but lacks detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance beyond being one of the hydrocarbons measured.",
        "score": 2
