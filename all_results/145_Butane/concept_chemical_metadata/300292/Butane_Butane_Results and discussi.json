    "context": "Of this, 98.4% was used as domestic fuel (cooking and water heating) and the 1.6% residual (4 MBD) for carburation. In the metropolitan area, LP gas consumption in the same year was 52.6 MBD, which is 20.6% of the total consumption. Based on these figures, the consumption of gasoline was 209.8% higher than LP gas in the MCMA, but the gasoline light compounds accounted only for the 10% of the total evaporative emissions and emissions from the exhaust. However, the ambient air of the samples analyzed registers a higher quantity of propane than butane, at an average ratio of 1.65, and the only possible source of the propane was LP gas from leaks and incomplete combustion. Exhaust and evaporative emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles introduce a higher concentration of butane than propane. The C3/C4 concentration ratio is always less than 0.5. On the contrary, the concentration of propane present in LP gas is higher than that of butane. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed primarily in relation to its usage as a domestic fuel and its emissions profile compared to propane. The text highlights that butane is a significant component of exhaust and evaporative emissions from fossil fuel combustion, indicating its relevance in environmental studies. However, the relationship is not elaborated upon beyond its presence in emissions and fuel consumption statistics.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as butane is mentioned in the context of fuel usage and emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific chemical properties or interactions. The relationship is more about its role in fuel consumption rather than a direct chemical or functional relationship.",
