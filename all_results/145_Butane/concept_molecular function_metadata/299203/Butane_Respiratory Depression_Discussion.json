    "context": "emphasize the anesthetic or narcotic effect of n-butane and isobutane on CNS. This happens because of the lipophilic features of butane which is distributed by blood in lipid-rich tissues such as brain and fat-tissues, and also in the liver, heart, and kidney. 13 Inhalation of hydrocarbons or 0.5\u201315% butane in the air is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, and the sudden surge of this hormone is thought to result in fatal arrythmia, 1,13 probably ventricular fibrillation, immediately after sudden fear or hard muscular exercise such as fright, running and sexual activity. 8,12,14,15\u201317 Summarizing all previously mentioned, hypoxia, respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia are probably three possible mechanisms of sudden death related to volatile abuse of inhalants containing butane. No pathognomonic morphological changes have been detected yet for butane intoxication or sudden death caused by butane or other similar inhalants. Early cardiac death is not only an issue for discussion in forensic medicine, but also a detection problem for the pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis has improved detection of early ischemic changes in an almost revolutionary manner. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is linked to respiratory depression through its anesthetic and narcotic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Inhalation of butane can lead to hypoxia and respiratory depression, which are identified as potential mechanisms for sudden death associated with volatile inhalant abuse. The lipophilic nature of butane allows it to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, including the brain, exacerbating its depressant effects on respiration.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butane and respiratory depression, supported by evidence of its anesthetic effects and the mechanisms leading to hypoxia and respiratory issues. The context provides a clear relationship, although it does not delve into quantitative data.",
