    "context": "emphasize the anesthetic or narcotic effect of n-butane and isobutane on CNS. This happens because of the lipophilic features of butane which is distributed by blood in lipid-rich tissues such as brain and fat-tissues, and also in the liver, heart, and kidney. 13 Inhalation of hydrocarbons or 0.5\u201315% butane in the air is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, and the sudden surge of this hormone is thought to result in fatal arrythmia, 1,13 probably ventricular fibrillation, immediately after sudden fear or hard muscular exercise such as fright, running and sexual activity. 8,12,14,15\u201317 Summarizing all previously mentioned, hypoxia, respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia are probably three possible mechanisms of sudden death related to volatile abuse of inhalants containing butane. No pathognomonic morphological changes have been detected yet for butane intoxication or sudden death caused by butane or other similar inhalants. Early cardiac death is not only an issue for discussion in forensic medicine, but also a detection problem for the pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis has improved detection of early ischemic changes in an almost revolutionary manner. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is linked to cardiac arrhythmia through its anesthetic and narcotic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Inhalation of butane is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, potentially leading to fatal arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, especially during stress or physical exertion. The text suggests that hypoxia, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmia are mechanisms contributing to sudden death associated with butane inhalation, highlighting a significant health risk related to its use.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between butane and cardiac arrhythmia, as the context explicitly discusses how butane inhalation can lead to fatal arrhythmias through its effects on the heart and CNS, establishing a critical relationship.",
        "score": 5
