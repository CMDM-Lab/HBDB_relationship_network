    "context": "3 Inhalants that are commonly abused in order to get \u201chigh\u201d contain substances like toluene, butane, propane, fluorocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons or acetone. 2 Lethal intoxication is more accidental than suicidal by causing death through several mechanisms: suffocation, trauma after dangerous behavior, vagal inhibition, respiratory depression and \u201csudden-sniffing death syndrome\u201d following cardiac arrhythmia 4\u20138 which becomes the cause of death in as many as 50 percent of inhalant-related deaths. 4 The release of a burst of catecholamines that can trigger ventricular fibrillation at the start of inhalant abuse, according to some authors, causes the sudden sniffing death syndrome. 1 Butane \u2013 CH3(CH2)2CH3 (synonyms: n-butane, butyl hydride, methylethyl-methane), a liquefied petroleum gas with LC50 of 658\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123, belongs to a class of aliphatic hydrocarbons which is commonly found in lighter fluid, fuel, spray paint, hair spray, room freshener, deodorants. Frostbite due to rapid cooling on evaporation occurs if butane is used in a liquid state, but most commonly it is abused as a gaseous propellant in an inhalant and acts as a simple asphyxiant causing toxicity by displacing oxygen and preventing it from reaching important tissues and organs. 9 Our report covers two cases of sudden death occurring after the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing only butane. Most reports regard accidental inhalation of a mixture of n-propane, n-butane and isobutane, while only five reported fatal outcomes caused by the intentional inhalation of either n-butane or isobutane. 1,8,10 Histological, immunohistochemical as well as toxicological analyses were performed.

        "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a liquefied petroleum gas commonly used as a propellant in various consumer products, including lighter fluid and aerosol sprays. It is highlighted for its potential for abuse as an inhalant, where it acts as a simple asphyxiant by displacing oxygen, leading to toxicity and fatal outcomes. The relationship between butane and propellant is significant, as butane's primary use in products is as a propellant, which is also linked to its abuse and associated health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between butane and its role as a propellant, supported by evidence of its use in consumer products and the health risks associated with its inhalation. The context provides clear details on how butane functions as a propellant and its implications for safety.",
