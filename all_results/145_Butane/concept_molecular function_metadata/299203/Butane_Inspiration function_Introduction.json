    "context": "1 Butane \u2013 CH3(CH2)2CH3 (synonyms: n-butane, butyl hydride, methylethyl-methane), a liquefied petroleum gas with LC50 of 658\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22123, belongs to a class of aliphatic hydrocarbons which is commonly found in lighter fluid, fuel, spray paint, hair spray, room freshener, deodorants. Frostbite due to rapid cooling on evaporation occurs if butane is used in a liquid state, but most commonly it is abused as a gaseous propellant in an inhalant and acts as a simple asphyxiant causing toxicity by displacing oxygen and preventing it from reaching important tissues and organs. 9 Our report covers two cases of sudden death occurring after the sniffing of a cigarette lighter refill containing only butane. Most reports regard accidental inhalation of a mixture of n-propane, n-butane and isobutane, while only five reported fatal outcomes caused by the intentional inhalation of either n-butane or isobutane. 1,8,10 Histological, immunohistochemical as well as toxicological analyses were performed. The dead body of a 25-year-old male, 181\u00a0cm high, appropriately nourished, was found lying supine in an abandoned restaurant. A\u00a0tin lighter refill was found next to the body. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is described as a gaseous propellant that can be abused through inhalation, leading to asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. This displacement directly impacts the inspiration function, as it prevents oxygen from reaching vital tissues and organs, potentially resulting in fatal outcomes. The report highlights cases of sudden death linked to butane inhalation, emphasizing its toxic effects on respiratory function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butane and inspiration function, as the inhalation of butane directly affects the ability to inspire oxygen, leading to severe health consequences. The context provides evidence of fatal outcomes due to this relationship.",
        "score": 4
