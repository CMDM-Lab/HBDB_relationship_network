    "context": "This happens because of the lipophilic features of butane which is distributed by blood in lipid-rich tissues such as brain and fat-tissues, and also in the liver, heart, and kidney. 13 Inhalation of hydrocarbons or 0.5\u201315% butane in the air is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, and the sudden surge of this hormone is thought to result in fatal arrythmia, 1,13 probably ventricular fibrillation, immediately after sudden fear or hard muscular exercise such as fright, running and sexual activity. 8,12,14,15\u201317 Summarizing all previously mentioned, hypoxia, respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia are probably three possible mechanisms of sudden death related to volatile abuse of inhalants containing butane. No pathognomonic morphological changes have been detected yet for butane intoxication or sudden death caused by butane or other similar inhalants. Early cardiac death is not only an issue for discussion in forensic medicine, but also a detection problem for the pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis has improved detection of early ischemic changes in an almost revolutionary manner. Although not used in everyday practice, the possibility of using several immunohistochemical staining for detecting myofibrile damage within half an hour of the hypoxic incident is thoroughly presented in several studies 1,16\u201319 and was even detected in advanced putrefaction.

        "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its lipophilic properties and potential effects on the myocardium, leading to fatal arrhythmias. However, there is no direct mention of morphologically altered structures specifically linked to butane intoxication. The text indicates that no pathognomonic morphological changes have been identified for butane exposure, suggesting a lack of established structural alterations associated with its toxicity.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as butane's effects on the myocardium are mentioned, but there is no detailed discussion of how these effects relate to morphologically altered structures. The relationship is general and lacks specific evidence.",
