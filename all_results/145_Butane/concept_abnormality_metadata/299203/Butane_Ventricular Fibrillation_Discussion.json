    "context": "This theory is supported by acute congestion of inner organs found on autopsy. 1 Sugie et\u00a0al. emphasize the anesthetic or narcotic effect of n-butane and isobutane on CNS. This happens because of the lipophilic features of butane which is distributed by blood in lipid-rich tissues such as brain and fat-tissues, and also in the liver, heart, and kidney. 13 Inhalation of hydrocarbons or 0.5\u201315% butane in the air is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, and the sudden surge of this hormone is thought to result in fatal arrythmia, 1,13 probably ventricular fibrillation, immediately after sudden fear or hard muscular exercise such as fright, running and sexual activity. 8,12,14,15\u201317 Summarizing all previously mentioned, hypoxia, respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmia are probably three possible mechanisms of sudden death related to volatile abuse of inhalants containing butane. No pathognomonic morphological changes have been detected yet for butane intoxication or sudden death caused by butane or other similar inhalants. Early cardiac death is not only an issue for discussion in forensic medicine, but also a detection problem for the pathologist. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane is linked to ventricular fibrillation through its anesthetic effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and its potential to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline. Inhalation of butane can lead to fatal arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation, following sudden physical stress or emotional triggers. The text suggests that butane exposure may contribute to sudden cardiac events, highlighting a critical relationship between the substance and the risk of arrhythmias.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context directly connects butane inhalation to the risk of ventricular fibrillation through specific mechanisms, including sensitization of the myocardium and the potential for fatal arrhythmias. This relationship is critical in understanding the health risks associated with butane exposure.",
