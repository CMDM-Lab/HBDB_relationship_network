    "context": "20 Since no strong positive reaction was observed in either of our cases, although in Case 1 a barely seen too weak diffuse reaction could be observed suggesting an initiation of deposition, we excluded early cardiac death or death within 1\u00a0h or more. In the same time there was an undoubtedly strong and diffuse reaction of at least one of the negative markers (Myoglobin or/and Desmin) and other positive markers (Fibrinogen or/and Fibronectin) in both cases. Therefore, we concluded the following: first, asphyxia was the main cause of acute myocardial lesion and second, the time of death can be put within a minimum of half an hour, but definitely less than an hour since the abuse. It is clear that butane inhalation caused asphyxia and death, but when we observe the pathophysiological cascade and the histological alveo-septal changes in the lungs which probably contributed to asphyxia or even provoked it, irreparable acute myocardial ischemic lesions were the point with no return. Conflict of interest None. The Mexico City metropolitan area (MCMA) is a densely populated region; the 1990 census carried out by INEGI (1991) showed a population of approximately 15 million in this area. Current census results from INEGI (2001) show that the population in the MCMA has increased to nearly 18 million. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butane inhalation is implicated as a cause of asphyxia, which subsequently leads to acute myocardial ischemic lesions. The text suggests that the pathophysiological effects of butane contribute to severe respiratory distress, resulting in insufficient oxygen supply to the heart, thereby causing ischemia. This establishes a direct link between butane exposure and acute myocardial ischemia through the mechanism of asphyxia.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between butane and acute myocardial ischemia, as the inhalation of butane is clearly linked to asphyxia, which is identified as a critical factor leading to myocardial ischemic damage.",
        "score": 5
