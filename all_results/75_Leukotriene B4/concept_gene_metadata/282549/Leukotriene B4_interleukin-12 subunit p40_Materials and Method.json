[1] Measurement of Soluble Mediators. [2] Pleural fluid was collected by flushing the cavity with 2 ml of PBS. [3] Samples were stored at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c80\u00c2\u00b0C until ELISA measurements according to the instructions of the manufacturer (KC, IL-6, TNF-\u00ce\u00b1, IL-1\u00ce\u00b2, IL-12p40, IL-4, interferon-\u00ce\u00b3, and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were obtained from Genzyme-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, and LTB4 was purchased from R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN). [1] Statistics. [2] Data are expressed as means \u00c2\u00b1 S.E.M. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired Student's t test if applicable, or results were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA, and if variances were nonhomogeneous, differences between groups were assessed using Dunnett's method with commercially available statistic software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). [3] P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant (\u00e2\u02dc\u2026, P < 0.05; \u00e2\u02dc\u2026\u00e2\u02dc\u2026, P < 0.01). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and interleukin-12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40) are both mentioned as soluble mediators measured in pleural fluid samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction within the provided context. They are part of a broader analysis of inflammatory mediators, but their specific roles or connections are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both LTB4 and IL-12p40 are included in the list of soluble mediators analyzed, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance in the context provided.",
