    "context": "LTB4 plays an important role in different inflammatory processes. It is well-known to function as a potent chemotactic factor attracting leukocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, dendritic cells and effector T cells. Thereby it shows different ways of signalling: Whereas it was also reported that LTB4 has gene regulatory effects by interacting with the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha its main regulatory function occurs likely via cell surface receptors. Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant chemotactic factor involved in inflammatory processes, while the LTB4R gene encodes receptors (BLT1 and BLT2) that mediate LTB4 signaling. The interaction between LTB4 and its receptors is crucial for leukocyte attraction and regulation of inflammatory responses, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and the LTB4R gene in the context of immune signaling and inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as LTB4 directly interacts with the LTB4R gene products (BLT1 and BLT2), which are essential for its signaling and function in inflammation. This relationship is critical in understanding the mechanisms of inflammatory diseases.",
        "score": 5
