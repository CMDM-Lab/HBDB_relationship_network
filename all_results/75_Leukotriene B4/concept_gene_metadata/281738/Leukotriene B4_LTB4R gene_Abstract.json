    "context": "[1] Leukotrienes are eicosanoid lipid mediators generated from arachidonic acid by the enzyme ALOX5 (5-lipoxygenase; ). [2] Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) contributes to leukocyte accumulation in many inflammatory diseases, and its production by neutrophils is triggered by multiple stimuli . [3] Dual expression of ALOX5 and the LTB4 receptor LTB4R1 in neutrophils is required for their recruitment in a model of arthritis, revealing a paracrine amplification loop in this setting (; ). [4] LTB4R1 is also highly expressed on human and mouse eosinophils , and human eosinophils produce LTB4 , raising the possibility of paracrine leukotriene signaling between eosinophils analogous to that established for neutrophils. [1] Eosinophil accumulation is highly associated with infection by multicellular endoparasites, and this association is conserved from zebrafish to humans (; ). [2] Sentinel cells in tissues are thought to instigate eosinophil accumulation by releasing the cytokines TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 in response to worm-induced injury . [3] These cytokines stimulate innate lymphoid cells, which enable eosinophil survival through IL-5 production. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator involved in inflammatory responses, and its receptor, LTB4R1, is crucial for mediating the effects of LTB4 in leukocyte recruitment, particularly in neutrophils. The dual expression of ALOX5 and LTB4R1 in neutrophils is essential for their recruitment in inflammatory conditions, indicating a direct functional relationship between LTB4 and the LTB4R gene in the context of immune responses and inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as LTB4 is directly linked to its receptor LTB4R1 in the context of inflammatory responses, with evidence of their interaction in leukocyte recruitment and signaling pathways.",
        "score": 5
