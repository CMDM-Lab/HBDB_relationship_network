    "context": "[2] MCP-1 induced a dose-dependent increase in the numbers of cytoplasmic lipid bodies within resident peritoneal macrophages isolated from naive mice (Fig. 2\u00e2\u2021\u201cA). [3] As shown in Fig. 2\u00e2\u2021\u201cB, rMCP-1-induced lipid body biogenesis was a rapid phenomenon, which was significant within 2 h and maximum within 6 h at the concentration of 100 nM. [4] In parallel to the increased number of newly assembled lipid bodies (within 6 h), rMCP-1 (100 nM) also caused the release of LTB4 by macrophages (Fig. 2\u00e2\u2021\u201cC). [5] MCP-1-induced lipid body biogenesis and LTB4-synthesizing function are not due to LPS contamination, because: 1) the neutralizing Ab against MCP-1 abolished MCP-1 effect (17.8 \u00c2\u00b1 0.9 lipid bodies per rMCP-1-stimulated cell vs 4.2 \u00c2\u00b1 0.1 lipid bodies found in anti-MCP-1-treated MCP-1-stimulated cell; n = 6); and 2) the resident peritoneal macrophages isolated from TLR4-deficient mice respond to rMCP-1 (100 nM), but not to LPS, with rapid (6 h) lipid body biogenesis and LTB4 synthesis and similar magnitude to that observed with macrophages isolated from wild-type mice (Table I\u00e2\u2021\u201c). [1] MCP-1 induces lipid body biogenesis and LTB4 synthesis within newly formed lipid bodies of in vitro-stimulated macrophages. [2] Dose-response (A) and kinetic (B) curves of lipid body biogenesis triggered by direct in vitro stimulation of macrophages with MCP-1. [3] In C, analysis of LTB4 production was performed 6 h after MCP-1 (100 nM) stimulation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is produced by macrophages in response to MCP-1 stimulation, which is shown to occur independently of TLR4 signaling, as TLR4-deficient mice still exhibit LTB4 synthesis. This indicates that while LTB4 is a product of macrophage activation, its synthesis does not rely on TLR4, suggesting alternative pathways for its production in inflammatory responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and TLR4, as the context demonstrates that LTB4 synthesis occurs in TLR4-deficient macrophages, indicating a clear relationship in the context of immune response mechanisms. However, the exact pathways involved are not fully elucidated.",
