    "context": " [7] A LTC4/D4 antagonist ONO-1078 and a histamine H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine had no effect on the granulocyte infiltration, either.  [8] The LTB4 antagonist also decreased substance P-induced neutrophil, but not eosinophil, infiltration into mouse skin at 24 h.  [9] In contrast, the PAF antagonist inhibited Ag-induced eosinophil infiltration of mouse skin, whereas the LTB4 antagonist inhibited the Ag-induced neutrophil infiltration. [10] We conclude that LTB4 is a major mast cell-derived chemotactic mediator for initiating substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin. [11] Our results suggest that LTB4 antagonists might be useful in preventing such neurogenic inflammation.  [1] Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and vibration induced white finger syndrome (VWF) are common causes of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.  [2] Previous studies have suggested an increase in inflammation in patients with SSc. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator that promotes the infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into mouse skin, particularly in response to substance P. The study highlights LTB4's role in initiating inflammatory responses, suggesting that antagonists targeting LTB4 could be beneficial in managing neurogenic inflammation. This establishes a clear and direct relationship between LTB4 and chemotaxis, as LTB4 is directly involved in the chemotactic process for immune cell migration.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as LTB4 is explicitly described as a major chemotactic mediator, directly linking it to the process of chemotaxis in the context of inflammation. The evidence provided supports the critical role of LTB4 in immune cell infiltration.",
