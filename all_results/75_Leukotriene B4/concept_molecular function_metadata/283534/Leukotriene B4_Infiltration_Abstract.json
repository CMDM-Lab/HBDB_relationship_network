    "context": " [5] Pretreatment with the LTB4 antagonist decreased substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin at 6 h to the same extent that an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, disodium cromoglycate, decreased those responses.  [6] However, pretreatment with the PAF antagonist affected neither substance P-induced neutrophil nor eosinophil infiltration at 6 h.  [7] A LTC4/D4 antagonist ONO-1078 and a histamine H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine had no effect on the granulocyte infiltration, either.  [8] The LTB4 antagonist also decreased substance P-induced neutrophil, but not eosinophil, infiltration into mouse skin at 24 h.  [9] In contrast, the PAF antagonist inhibited Ag-induced eosinophil infiltration of mouse skin, whereas the LTB4 antagonist inhibited the Ag-induced neutrophil infiltration. [10] We conclude that LTB4 is a major mast cell-derived chemotactic mediator for initiating substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin. [11] Our results suggest that LTB4 antagonists might be useful in preventing such neurogenic inflammation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator that promotes the infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into mouse skin in response to substance P. The study demonstrates that pretreatment with an LTB4 antagonist effectively reduces this infiltration, indicating a direct role of LTB4 in mediating inflammatory responses. This suggests that LTB4 is crucial for initiating and sustaining the infiltration of these immune cells during neurogenic inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between LTB4 and infiltration, as the context provides clear evidence of LTB4's role in promoting neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration, supported by experimental data showing the effects of LTB4 antagonists.",
