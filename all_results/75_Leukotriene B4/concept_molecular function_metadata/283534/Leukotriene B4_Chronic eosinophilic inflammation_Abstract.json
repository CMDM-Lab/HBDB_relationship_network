    "context": " [7] A LTC4/D4 antagonist ONO-1078 and a histamine H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine had no effect on the granulocyte infiltration, either.  [8] The LTB4 antagonist also decreased substance P-induced neutrophil, but not eosinophil, infiltration into mouse skin at 24 h.  [9] In contrast, the PAF antagonist inhibited Ag-induced eosinophil infiltration of mouse skin, whereas the LTB4 antagonist inhibited the Ag-induced neutrophil infiltration. [10] We conclude that LTB4 is a major mast cell-derived chemotactic mediator for initiating substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin. [11] Our results suggest that LTB4 antagonists might be useful in preventing such neurogenic inflammation.  [1] Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and vibration induced white finger syndrome (VWF) are common causes of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.  [2] Previous studies have suggested an increase in inflammation in patients with SSc. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator involved in the infiltration of eosinophils into mouse skin during neurogenic inflammation. The study indicates that LTB4 antagonists may help prevent eosinophil infiltration, suggesting a direct role of LTB4 in chronic eosinophilic inflammation. This highlights the potential therapeutic implications of targeting LTB4 in conditions characterized by eosinophilic inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and chronic eosinophilic inflammation, as the context discusses LTB4's role in mediating eosinophil infiltration and suggests that antagonists could mitigate this process, indicating a significant relationship supported by experimental evidence.",
