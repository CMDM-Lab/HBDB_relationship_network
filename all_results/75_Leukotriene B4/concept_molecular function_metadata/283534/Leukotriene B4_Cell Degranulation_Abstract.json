    "context": " [2] However, the mediator responsible for this granulocyte infiltration has not been determined.  [3] In this study, we determined which mediator from cutaneous mast cells mediates substance P-induced granulocyte infiltration in the skin by the use of two mediator antagonists; one for platelet activating factor (PAF) CV-6209 and the other for leukotriene B4 (LTB4) ONO-4057.  [4] Subcutaneous injection of substance P (10(-7)-10(-5) M) caused granulocyte infiltration in the skin of BALB/c mice in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion.  [5] Pretreatment with the LTB4 antagonist decreased substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin at 6 h to the same extent that an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, disodium cromoglycate, decreased those responses.  [6] However, pretreatment with the PAF antagonist affected neither substance P-induced neutrophil nor eosinophil infiltration at 6 h.  [7] A LTC4/D4 antagonist ONO-1078 and a histamine H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine had no effect on the granulocyte infiltration, either.  [8] The LTB4 antagonist also decreased substance P-induced neutrophil, but not eosinophil, infiltration into mouse skin at 24 h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated as a mediator in substance P-induced granulocyte infiltration, which is associated with cell degranulation. The study shows that pretreatment with an LTB4 antagonist significantly reduced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration in response to substance P, indicating that LTB4 plays a crucial role in the degranulation process of mast cells and subsequent granulocyte recruitment in the skin.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and cell degranulation, as the study provides direct evidence of LTB4's role in mediating granulocyte infiltration and its interaction with mast cell degranulation processes.",
        "score": 5
