    "context": " [8] The LTB4 antagonist also decreased substance P-induced neutrophil, but not eosinophil, infiltration into mouse skin at 24 h.  [9] In contrast, the PAF antagonist inhibited Ag-induced eosinophil infiltration of mouse skin, whereas the LTB4 antagonist inhibited the Ag-induced neutrophil infiltration. [10] We conclude that LTB4 is a major mast cell-derived chemotactic mediator for initiating substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin. [11] Our results suggest that LTB4 antagonists might be useful in preventing such neurogenic inflammation.  [1] Systemic sclerosis (SSc) and vibration induced white finger syndrome (VWF) are common causes of secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.  [2] Previous studies have suggested an increase in inflammation in patients with SSc.  [3] Vibration induced white finger syndrome occurs in workers exposed to vibration and is now a prescribed disease. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant mediator in neutrophil infiltration during neurogenic inflammation. The study indicates that LTB4 antagonists can effectively reduce this infiltration, suggesting their potential therapeutic role in managing inflammation. This highlights a direct relationship where LTB4 antagonists counteract the effects of LTB4 in inflammatory processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly discusses the role of LTB4 antagonists in inhibiting LTB4-mediated neutrophil infiltration, indicating a critical therapeutic relationship in the context of inflammation.",
        "score": 5
