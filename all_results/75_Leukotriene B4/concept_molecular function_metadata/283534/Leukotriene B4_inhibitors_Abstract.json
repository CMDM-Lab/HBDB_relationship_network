    "context": " [2] However, the mediator responsible for this granulocyte infiltration has not been determined.  [3] In this study, we determined which mediator from cutaneous mast cells mediates substance P-induced granulocyte infiltration in the skin by the use of two mediator antagonists; one for platelet activating factor (PAF) CV-6209 and the other for leukotriene B4 (LTB4) ONO-4057.  [4] Subcutaneous injection of substance P (10(-7)-10(-5) M) caused granulocyte infiltration in the skin of BALB/c mice in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion.  [5] Pretreatment with the LTB4 antagonist decreased substance P-induced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration into mouse skin at 6 h to the same extent that an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, disodium cromoglycate, decreased those responses.  [6] However, pretreatment with the PAF antagonist affected neither substance P-induced neutrophil nor eosinophil infiltration at 6 h.  [7] A LTC4/D4 antagonist ONO-1078 and a histamine H1 antagonist chlorpheniramine had no effect on the granulocyte infiltration, either.  [8] The LTB4 antagonist also decreased substance P-induced neutrophil, but not eosinophil, infiltration into mouse skin at 24 h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a mediator involved in substance P-induced granulocyte infiltration in the skin. The study demonstrates that the use of LTB4 inhibitors effectively reduces neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration in response to substance P, indicating a significant role of LTB4 in this inflammatory process. The findings suggest that LTB4 inhibitors can modulate the inflammatory response mediated by LTB4, highlighting their potential therapeutic relevance in conditions characterized by granulocyte infiltration.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between Leukotriene B4 and its inhibitors, as the context provides clear evidence of the inhibitory effects on granulocyte infiltration, establishing a critical relationship in the inflammatory response.",
