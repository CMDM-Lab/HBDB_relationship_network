    "context": "In addition, erythrocyte, hemoglobin and platelet counts were the same in each group, which excluded the possibility that the increased neutrophils were only adaptive responses to stress reaction. Neutrophils are the most abundant population of leukocytes, which not only constitute the defense against pathogens but also can cause extensive tissue damage. The homeostasis of neutrophils in the circulation is regulated by a complex network of intracellular apoptotic/survival signaling pathways. Previous studies have reported that the intermittent hypoxia/reoxygenation in SDB could delay or inhibit the apoptosis of neutrophils, while LTB4 could induce a positive feedback autocrine pathway that supports neutrophil survival, which both have explained how the high percentage of neutrophils accumulates in the circulation of SDB children with the help of LTs. Of interest, Li et al. found increased neutrophils in induced sputum collected from children with SDB, and the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlated with the severity of SDB. In addition, LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant that facilitates recruitment and endothelial cell adhesion of neutrophils to the inflammatory site and promotes recruitment of inflammatory cells into tissues. This implies a probable existence of systemic neutrophlic inflammation in childhood SDB, and the elevations of neutrophils in the local airway as reported by Li et al. may be due to a persistent and enhanced neutrophil migration from the peripheral blood through the recruitment of LTs.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is described as playing a crucial role in the feedback mechanisms that regulate neutrophil survival and recruitment during systemic inflammation, particularly in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). LTB4 induces a positive feedback autocrine pathway that enhances neutrophil survival, contributing to their accumulation in circulation. This feedback loop is significant in understanding the inflammatory response and the persistence of neutrophils in SDB, highlighting LTB4's role in mediating these processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and feedback mechanisms in neutrophil regulation, supported by evidence of LTB4's role in promoting neutrophil survival and recruitment. The context provides a clear understanding of how LTB4 influences neutrophilic inflammation in SDB, indicating a strong relationship.",
