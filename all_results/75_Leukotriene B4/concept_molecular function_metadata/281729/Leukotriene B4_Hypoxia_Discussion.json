    "context": "In addition, erythrocyte, hemoglobin and platelet counts were the same in each group, which excluded the possibility that the increased neutrophils were only adaptive responses to stress reaction. Neutrophils are the most abundant population of leukocytes, which not only constitute the defense against pathogens but also can cause extensive tissue damage. The homeostasis of neutrophils in the circulation is regulated by a complex network of intracellular apoptotic/survival signaling pathways. Previous studies have reported that the intermittent hypoxia/reoxygenation in SDB could delay or inhibit the apoptosis of neutrophils, while LTB4 could induce a positive feedback autocrine pathway that supports neutrophil survival, which both have explained how the high percentage of neutrophils accumulates in the circulation of SDB children with the help of LTs. Of interest, Li et al. found increased neutrophils in induced sputum collected from children with SDB, and the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlated with the severity of SDB. In addition, LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant that facilitates recruitment and endothelial cell adhesion of neutrophils to the inflammatory site and promotes recruitment of inflammatory cells into tissues. This implies a probable existence of systemic neutrophlic inflammation in childhood SDB, and the elevations of neutrophils in the local airway as reported by Li et al. may be due to a persistent and enhanced neutrophil migration from the peripheral blood through the recruitment of LTs.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is linked to hypoxia through its role in regulating neutrophil survival and recruitment during intermittent hypoxia/reoxygenation events, such as those seen in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). LTB4 promotes the accumulation of neutrophils in circulation, which correlates with the severity of SDB, suggesting that hypoxia may enhance the inflammatory response mediated by LTB4, leading to systemic neutrophilic inflammation in affected children.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and hypoxia, as the context discusses how LTB4 influences neutrophil survival and recruitment in the setting of hypoxia, supported by evidence of increased neutrophils in SDB children. This indicates a clear relationship within the inflammatory response framework.",
