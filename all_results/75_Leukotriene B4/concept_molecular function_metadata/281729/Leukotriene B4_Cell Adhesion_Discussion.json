    "context": "The homeostasis of neutrophils in the circulation is regulated by a complex network of intracellular apoptotic/survival signaling pathways. Previous studies have reported that the intermittent hypoxia/reoxygenation in SDB could delay or inhibit the apoptosis of neutrophils, while LTB4 could induce a positive feedback autocrine pathway that supports neutrophil survival, which both have explained how the high percentage of neutrophils accumulates in the circulation of SDB children with the help of LTs. Of interest, Li et al. found increased neutrophils in induced sputum collected from children with SDB, and the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlated with the severity of SDB. In addition, LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant that facilitates recruitment and endothelial cell adhesion of neutrophils to the inflammatory site and promotes recruitment of inflammatory cells into tissues. This implies a probable existence of systemic neutrophlic inflammation in childhood SDB, and the elevations of neutrophils in the local airway as reported by Li et al. may be due to a persistent and enhanced neutrophil migration from the peripheral blood through the recruitment of LTs. Therefore, our findings confirm that systemic low-grade inflammation may either initiate or maintain the localized upper-airway inflammatory process in children with SDB. LTs are a family of biologically active compounds synthesized from the metabolism of arachidonic acid by a variety of cells, including neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, eosinophils and mast cells.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a potent chemoattractant that enhances the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells at inflammatory sites. This function is crucial for the recruitment of inflammatory cells, indicating that LTB4 plays a significant role in promoting cell adhesion and sustaining neutrophil accumulation in conditions like sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The relationship is underscored by the correlation between elevated neutrophil levels and the severity of SDB, suggesting that LTB4-mediated cell adhesion is integral to the inflammatory response in this condition.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and cell adhesion, as LTB4 is directly implicated in facilitating neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, which is critical for the inflammatory response. The context provides clear evidence of this relationship in the setting of SDB.",
        "score": 5
