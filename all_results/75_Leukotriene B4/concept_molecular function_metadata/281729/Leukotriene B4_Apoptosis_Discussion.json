    "context": "In addition, erythrocyte, hemoglobin and platelet counts were the same in each group, which excluded the possibility that the increased neutrophils were only adaptive responses to stress reaction. Neutrophils are the most abundant population of leukocytes, which not only constitute the defense against pathogens but also can cause extensive tissue damage. The homeostasis of neutrophils in the circulation is regulated by a complex network of intracellular apoptotic/survival signaling pathways. Previous studies have reported that the intermittent hypoxia/reoxygenation in SDB could delay or inhibit the apoptosis of neutrophils, while LTB4 could induce a positive feedback autocrine pathway that supports neutrophil survival, which both have explained how the high percentage of neutrophils accumulates in the circulation of SDB children with the help of LTs. Of interest, Li et al. found increased neutrophils in induced sputum collected from children with SDB, and the degree of neutrophilic inflammation correlated with the severity of SDB. In addition, LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant that facilitates recruitment and endothelial cell adhesion of neutrophils to the inflammatory site and promotes recruitment of inflammatory cells into tissues. This implies a probable existence of systemic neutrophlic inflammation in childhood SDB, and the elevations of neutrophils in the local airway as reported by Li et al. may be due to a persistent and enhanced neutrophil migration from the peripheral blood through the recruitment of LTs.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in the regulation of neutrophil survival and apoptosis. The text indicates that LTB4 can induce a positive feedback mechanism that supports neutrophil survival, potentially delaying apoptosis. This relationship is significant in understanding the accumulation of neutrophils in conditions like sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), where LTB4 facilitates both the recruitment of neutrophils and their prolonged survival, contributing to systemic inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and apoptosis, as LTB4 is shown to influence neutrophil survival and delay apoptosis, supported by evidence of its role in inflammatory responses. However, the relationship could be further elucidated with more quantitative data.",
