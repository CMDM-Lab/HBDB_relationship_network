    "context": "In spite of many disadvantages (e.g. differing affinities or specifications, mixed isotypes, unlasting amount of serum from one batch) EIA systems are still performed with polyclonal sera but not monoclonal antibodies. A first monoclonal antibody (IgG2b) against LTB4 was already described in 1984 and used for analytical purposes [15\u201317] but not for diagnostic. Using a new type of carrier molecule for immunogen synthesis combined with the hybridoma technique, we were able to generate a mouse monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype specific for LTB4 (S27BC6). S27BC6 was used as recognition molecule for the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect LTB4. Preparation of immunogen (LTB4-3-APA-VP1) and antigen (LTB4-3-APA-BSA) For immunization a conjugate from LTB4-3-aminopropylamide (LTB4-3-APA, Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, USA) and hamster polyomavirus capsid protein (VP1,) was prepared. LTB4-3-APA contains an additional reactive amino group, which was used to link the carrier protein. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is involved in the synthesis of a conjugate for immunogen preparation, which is crucial for generating a specific monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype) for LTB4 detection. The synthesis process includes linking LTB4-3-aminopropylamide to a carrier protein, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and the synthesis of immunological components for analytical purposes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and synthesis, as the context details the specific synthesis of an immunogen involving LTB4, which is essential for developing a diagnostic tool. This relationship is supported by the methodology described.",
