    "context": "Another parameter which could influence LTB4 measurements is the storage of EBC between collection and detection in EIA, which is only dependent on the experimenter. The mAb S27BC6 is therefore convenient to improve the detection of the biomarker LTB4 by a) simplifying the reproduction of accurate EIA kits and b) giving the possibility to relocate the detection of LTB4 to the area of EBC collection. The development of fast and easy to handle biosensors with monoclonal antibodies as recognition elements (immunosensors) have a great potential since they combine high specificities with high sensitivities. In addition, due to the high sensitivity and the possibility to couple such sensors directly to EBC collection units it is assumed that the LTB4 detection in exhaled breath could become more reliable with the help of mAb S27BC6D7.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its detection in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The use of monoclonal antibodies, specifically mAb S27BC6, is highlighted as a means to enhance the reliability of LTB4 measurements in EBC. This suggests a direct connection between LTB4 and exhalation, as the detection method aims to improve the accuracy of measuring this biomarker in breath samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and exhalation, as the context discusses the development of biosensors for reliable detection of LTB4 in exhaled breath. This indicates a clear relationship supported by the potential for improved measurement techniques.",
        "score": 4
