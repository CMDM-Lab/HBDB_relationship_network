    "context": "Induction of immune responses requires conjugation of the haptens to immunogenic carrier proteins. The hapten Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator that belongs to the group of eicosanoids (bioactive, 20 carbon-containing compounds). It is biosynthesized from arachidonic acid which is mainly stored within membrane phospholipids. Upon cell activation arachidonic acid is released and converted into LTB4 with the help of two enzymes: 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. LTB4 plays an important role in different inflammatory processes. It is well-known to function as a potent chemotactic factor attracting leukocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, dendritic cells and effector T cells. Thereby it shows different ways of signalling: Whereas it was also reported that LTB4 has gene regulatory effects by interacting with the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha its main regulatory function occurs likely via cell surface receptors.

        "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator that is biosynthesized from arachidonic acid upon cell activation. This process involves the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, which is then converted into LTB4 by specific enzymes. LTB4 plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses by acting as a chemotactic factor that attracts various leukocytes, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and cell activation in immune responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as LTB4 is directly produced during cell activation and is integral to the signaling pathways that mediate immune responses, highlighting its critical role in inflammation and leukocyte recruitment.",
        "score": 5
