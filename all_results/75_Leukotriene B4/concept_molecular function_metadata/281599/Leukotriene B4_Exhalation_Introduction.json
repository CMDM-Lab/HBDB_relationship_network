    "context": "Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems. Those systems capture LTB4 as target molecule by anti-LTB4 antisera from rabbit or chicken and are used nowadays in commercially available immunoassay test kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with various inflammatory diseases, including asthma and COPD. The presence of increased LTB4 levels in EBC suggests its role not only in leukocyte attraction but also as a potential diagnostic parameter for pulmonary diseases, emphasizing the relevance of exhalation as a non-invasive sampling method for assessing LTB4 concentrations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and exhalation, as the context discusses the diagnostic potential of measuring LTB4 in exhaled breath for inflammatory diseases, supported by evidence of increased concentrations in EBC.",
        "score": 4
