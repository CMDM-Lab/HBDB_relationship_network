    "context": "Upon cell activation arachidonic acid is released and converted into LTB4 with the help of two enzymes: 5-lipoxygenase and leukotriene A4 hydrolase. LTB4 plays an important role in different inflammatory processes. It is well-known to function as a potent chemotactic factor attracting leukocytes such as neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, dendritic cells and effector T cells. Thereby it shows different ways of signalling: Whereas it was also reported that LTB4 has gene regulatory effects by interacting with the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha its main regulatory function occurs likely via cell surface receptors. Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4.

        "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a key mediator in inflammatory processes, functioning through signal transduction pathways. It is produced from arachidonic acid and acts as a potent chemotactic factor for various leukocytes. LTB4 signals through G-protein coupled receptors (BLT1 and BLT2), influencing gene regulation and cellular responses, thereby playing a crucial role in immune signaling and inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and signal transduction, as LTB4 directly engages in signaling through specific receptors, influencing leukocyte behavior and gene expression in inflammatory contexts.",
        "score": 5
