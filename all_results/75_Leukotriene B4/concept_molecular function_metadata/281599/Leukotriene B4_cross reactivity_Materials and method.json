    "context": "After washing with tap water antibody S27BC6 was diluted (3-fold serial dilution from 15\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 2.5*10\u22124\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) in PBS/5% NCS and incubated with the immobilized antigen at RT for 1\u00a0h. Following another washing step plates were incubated at RT with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, USA) 1 to 5000 diluted in PBS/5% NCS for 45\u00a0min. Unbound conjugated molecules were removed by washing with tap water. Binding capacity of S27BC6 to pure LTB4 (Cayman Chemical Co.) and cross-reactivities (CR) between S27BC6 and LTB4-related haptens (Cayman Chemical Co.) were determined by competitive ELISA experiments. LTB4-3-APA-BSA was coated on 96 well microtiter plates (5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL dissolved in PBS, 50 \u03bcl/well, overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C). After blocking (PBS/5% NCS, 45\u00a0min, RT) the plates were washed with tap water. Two and a half \u03bcg/mL of monoclonal antibody S27BC6 (dissolved in PBS/5% NCS, 50 \u03bcl/well) were pre-incubated for 30\u00a0min with different concentrations (serial dilution from 6000 to 0.001\u00a0ng/mL) of LTB4 or potentially cross-reacting compound at RT before given onto the microtiter plate.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is the target antigen for the monoclonal antibody S27BC6, and the study investigates the cross-reactivity of this antibody with LTB4 and related haptens. The competitive ELISA experiments are designed to assess how well S27BC6 binds to LTB4 compared to other compounds, indicating the specificity and potential cross-reactivity of the antibody in recognizing LTB4-related structures. This relationship is crucial for understanding the antibody's effectiveness in detecting LTB4 in various biological samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and cross-reactivity, as the study provides evidence of S27BC6's binding capacity to LTB4 and its cross-reactivity with related haptens, indicating a clear functional relationship in the context of immunological assays.",
        "score": 4
