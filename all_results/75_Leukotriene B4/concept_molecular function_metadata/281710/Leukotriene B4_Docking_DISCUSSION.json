    "context": " [9] Although these residues may play a regulatory role rather than provide the actual docking area for docosahexaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid lacks a hydroxyl group that could potentially interact with Thr-169 of the cholane-sensing site. [10] Our studies clearly indicate that this interaction is critical for lipid-induced channel activation via the steroid-sensing site on the BK \u00ce\u00b21 TM2 domain, whether involving cholane steroids , heterocyclic synthetic analogs , or LTB4 itself (Fig. 6). [11] Moreover, the presence of a hydroxyl group within the hydrocarbon core of LTB4 explains the unique ability of LTB4 to activate the BK channel when compared with other members of the LT4 family. [12] Indeed, although LTA4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are able to dock onto the LTB4-sensing site and probably prevent LTB4 from effective docking, these non-activating leukotrienes do not possess a hydroxyl or any other polar group at a position in the molecule that would favor hydrogen bonding with Thr-169 (Fig. 7). [1] A unique feature of LTB4-induced BK channel activation is the high potency of LTB4. [2] Compared with other known BK channel activators (and lipid activators in particular), LTB4-induced BK channel activation could be observed at low nanomolar concentrations (EC50 \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc1 nm). [3] Indeed, other known lipid activators of BK channel require tens of micromolar in concentration to increase channel activity . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its ability to dock onto the BK channel's sensing site, which is critical for channel activation. The presence of a hydroxyl group in LTB4 enhances its docking capability compared to other leukotrienes, which lack this feature. This unique docking ability allows LTB4 to activate the BK channel at low concentrations, highlighting its significant role in lipid-induced channel activation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and docking, as the context explicitly discusses LTB4's unique docking properties and its critical role in activating the BK channel, supported by specific molecular interactions.",
        "score": 5
