    "context": " [7] However, our findings do not necessarily mean that the cholane steroid-sensing site could be targeted by any negatively charged lipid of physiological relevance known to regulate BK channel activity.  [8] For instance, docosahexaenoic acid activates BK currents via two amino acids located in the N terminus and first transmembrane region of the BK \u00ce\u00b21 protein .  [9] Although these residues may play a regulatory role rather than provide the actual docking area for docosahexaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid lacks a hydroxyl group that could potentially interact with Thr-169 of the cholane-sensing site. [10] Our studies clearly indicate that this interaction is critical for lipid-induced channel activation via the steroid-sensing site on the BK \u00ce\u00b21 TM2 domain, whether involving cholane steroids , heterocyclic synthetic analogs , or LTB4 itself (Fig. 6). [11] Moreover, the presence of a hydroxyl group within the hydrocarbon core of LTB4 explains the unique ability of LTB4 to activate the BK channel when compared with other members of the LT4 family. [12] Indeed, although LTA4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are able to dock onto the LTB4-sensing site and probably prevent LTB4 from effective docking, these non-activating leukotrienes do not possess a hydroxyl or any other polar group at a position in the molecule that would favor hydrogen bonding with Thr-169 (Fig. 7). [1] A unique feature of LTB4-induced BK channel activation is the high potency of LTB4. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its unique ability to activate BK channels, highlighting its distinct structural features compared to other leukotrienes. The text suggests that LTB4's hydroxyl group facilitates its interaction with the BK channel, indicating a specific drug interaction mechanism. This emphasizes the importance of LTB4 in pharmacological contexts, particularly regarding its role in channel activation and potential therapeutic implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and drug interactions, as the context provides evidence of LTB4's unique structural properties that enable it to activate BK channels, suggesting a clear pharmacological relevance.",
