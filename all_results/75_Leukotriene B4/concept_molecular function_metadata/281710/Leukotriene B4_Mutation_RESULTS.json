    "context": "[4] As expected from computational data, LTB4 repeatedly failed to increase cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21T169A NPo when tested under experimental conditions identical to those used to study leukotriene action on cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21 complexes (see above) (Fig. 6, A and C). [5] However, LTB4-induced BK channel activation was still evident when we probed LTB4 on cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21T165A complexes, the T165A substitution targeting a threonine residue located upstream and outside the steroid-sensing area (Fig. 6, B and C). [6] Collectively, our data underscore a distinct role for Thr-169 in LTB4 sensing by \u00ce\u00b21 subunit-containing BK channels.  [1] LTB4-induced BK channel activation cannot be observed in cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21 channels that contain mutations within the proposed LTB4 docking site in the BK \u00ce\u00b21 subunit.  [2] A, single-channel recordings from I/O patches excised from X. laevis oocytes expressing the cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21T169A channel.  [3] Current records depict cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21T169A channel activity before, during, and after 1 \u00ce\u00bcm LTB4 application.  [4] Vm = \u00e2\u02c6\u201940 mV; [Ca2+]i = 10 \u00ce\u00bcm. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is investigated for its role in activating BK channels, specifically in relation to mutations in the \u03b21 subunit of these channels. The study highlights that certain mutations, such as T169A, prevent LTB4 from inducing channel activation, indicating that the mutation directly affects the channel's response to LTB4. This suggests a critical relationship where the mutation alters the functional interaction between LTB4 and the BK channel, emphasizing the importance of specific residues in LTB4 sensing.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and mutation, as the context provides evidence that specific mutations in the \u03b21 subunit directly impact the activation of BK channels by LTB4. This relationship is supported by experimental data showing the effects of mutations on channel activity.",
