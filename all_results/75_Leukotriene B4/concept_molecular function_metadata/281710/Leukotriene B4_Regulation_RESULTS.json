    "context": " [6] The LTB4-induced increase in BK NPo correlated poorly with transmembrane voltage (Fig. 3B).  [7] On the other hand, a plot of LTB4-induced BK channel activation versus [Ca2+]i exhibited a complex shape (Fig. 3C).  [8] First, LTB4 failed to activate the BK channel in the absence of [Ca2+]i and at submicromolar [Ca2+]i.  [9] This finding is consistent with \u00ce\u00b21 subunit-dependent mechanisms for LTB4 effect; at submicromolar [Ca2+]i, \u00ce\u00b21 subunit regulation of channel activity is not apparent from Po evaluation . [10] Second, low micromolar [Ca2+]i seemed optimal for LTB4-induced increase in BK NPo. [11] Finally, LTB4-induced BK channel activation vanished when [Ca2+]i reached 30 \u00ce\u00bcm. [12] One plausible explanation for this loss of activity is that at high levels of activating [Ca2+]i, BK Po becomes too high for effective LTB4-induced channel activation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is involved in the regulation of BK channel activity, which is influenced by intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i). The study indicates that LTB4's effect on BK channel activation is dependent on specific calcium concentrations, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where LTB4 modulates channel activity based on calcium availability. This highlights the importance of LTB4 in the regulation of ion channels in response to calcium signaling.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and regulation, as the context discusses how LTB4 modulates BK channel activity in relation to calcium levels, providing evidence of a regulatory mechanism.",
