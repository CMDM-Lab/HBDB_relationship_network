    "context": "[3] The cells were then sequentially incubated with a rabbit anti-LTB4 antiserum (Cayman Chemical) for 45 min. [4] Then, a guinea pig anti-ADRP polyclonal Ab (Research Diagnostics) or Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes) was added for 45 min to distinguish cytoplasmic lipid bodies within leukocytes. [5] The cells were then washed with HBSS for 10 min (three times) and incubated with Cy2-labeled anti-rabbit IgG plus Cy3-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG secondary Abs for 1 h. [6] The specificity of the LTB4 immunolabeling was ascertained by three different approaches: 1) a nonimmune rabbit IgG used as an irrelevant control to anti-LTB4 Ab; 2) incubation (30 min prior EDAC) with the inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) zileuton (1 \u00ce\u00bcM) to avoid the synthesis of LTB4; and 3) the analysis of LTB4 staining within nonstimulated leukocytes. [1] The images were obtained using an Olympus BX-FLA fluorescence microscope and CoolSNAP-Pro CF digital camera in conjunction with Image-Pro Plus version 4.5.1.3 [2] software (MediaCybernetics). [3] The images were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software (Adobe Systems). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is studied in relation to its synthesis and detection in leukocytes, with a specific mention of inhibitors that block its production. The use of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton demonstrates a direct relationship, as it prevents the synthesis of LTB4, indicating that inhibitors play a crucial role in modulating LTB4 levels during the experimental procedures. This highlights the importance of inhibitors in the study of LTB4's biological functions and its implications in inflammatory responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and inhibitors, as the context provides evidence of the use of zileuton to inhibit LTB4 synthesis, demonstrating a clear functional relationship in the experimental setup.",
