        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed for its stability in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and saliva. The study indicates that LTB4 levels remain stable in EBC for 24 hours at room temperature and for over three months when frozen. This suggests that LTB4 can be reliably measured in exhaled breath, highlighting its potential as a biomarker in respiratory studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and exhalation, as the study provides evidence of LTB4's stability in exhaled breath condensate, indicating its relevance for respiratory analysis. However, the relationship is primarily focused on measurement rather than a direct physiological interaction.",
