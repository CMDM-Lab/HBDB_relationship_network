    "context": "[4] Through use of a sensitive method for measurement of \u00ce\u00b1-amylase in EBC, it was found that all samples that were positive for LTB4 also contained \u00ce\u00b1-amylase. [5] Therefore, it was concluded that saliva is a possible source of LTB4 in EBC. [1] LTB4 levels in EBC have been reported to be increased in several respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD  and cystic fibrosis . [2] The levels reported are generally in the 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c130\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1 concentration range, although, in more recent publications, the data are expressed as amounts of LTB4 obtained during a defined time period of tidal breathing . [3] The vast majority of published papers report on LTB4-like immunoreactivity (LTB4-IR) by the use of EIA measurements, but a recent paper by Montuschi et al.  validated the measurements of LTB4 with mass spectrometry. [4] There is, thus, no doubt that LTB4 may be present in EBC. [1] However, the question is: what is the source of LTB4 in EBC? ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is linked to respiration through its increased levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in various respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. The presence of LTB4 in EBC suggests a potential role in respiratory inflammation and disease monitoring, indicating its relevance to respiratory function and health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and respiration, as LTB4 levels are specifically noted to increase in respiratory diseases, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for respiratory conditions. This relationship is supported by evidence from multiple studies.",
        "score": 4
