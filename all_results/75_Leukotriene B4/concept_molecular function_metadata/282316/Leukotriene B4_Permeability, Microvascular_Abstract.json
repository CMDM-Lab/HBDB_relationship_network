    "context": "[6] In fact, few experimental studies have satisfactorily explained the processes that determine the transfer of different molecules from the lungs and airways into condensates of exhaled air. [1] Leukotriene (LT)B4 is a potent chemotactic mediator that may be involved in several inflammatory reactions in the lungs and airways , . [2] LTB4 is produced predominantly by activated neutrophils, but also by alveolar macrophages and in transcellular reactions involving inflammatory cells and surrounding structural elements . [3] In addition to recruiting neutrophils and causing increased microvascular permeability , LTB4 may stimulate lymphocyte migration in the lung  and constriction of pulmonary blood vessels via indirect mechanisms . [4] In comparison with healthy subjects, the LTB4 levels have been reported to be elevated in EBC collected from subjects with asthma , cystic fibrosis  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . [1] The primary aim of the present study was to measure the levels of immunoreactive LTB4 in EBC collected in a human model where a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation was induced . [2] The model involves a standardised exposure of healthy subjects in a pig house for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a potent chemotactic mediator involved in inflammatory reactions in the lungs, particularly noted for its role in increasing microvascular permeability. LTB4 is produced by activated neutrophils and is linked to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, which suggests a direct relationship between LTB4 and the regulation of microvascular permeability during inflammatory responses in the lungs.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and microvascular permeability, as LTB4 is explicitly mentioned to cause increased permeability in the context of lung inflammation, supported by its role in recruiting neutrophils and other inflammatory cells.",
        "score": 4
