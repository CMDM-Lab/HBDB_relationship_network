    "context": "[2] LTB4 is produced predominantly by activated neutrophils, but also by alveolar macrophages and in transcellular reactions involving inflammatory cells and surrounding structural elements . [3] In addition to recruiting neutrophils and causing increased microvascular permeability , LTB4 may stimulate lymphocyte migration in the lung  and constriction of pulmonary blood vessels via indirect mechanisms . [4] In comparison with healthy subjects, the LTB4 levels have been reported to be elevated in EBC collected from subjects with asthma , cystic fibrosis  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . [1] The primary aim of the present study was to measure the levels of immunoreactive LTB4 in EBC collected in a human model where a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation was induced . [2] The model involves a standardised exposure of healthy subjects in a pig house for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026h. [3] This challenge results in a two- to three-fold increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, and an associated intense airway neutrophilic inflammation. [4] Previous studies have shown a 75-fold increase in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid  and a two- to 5.5-fold increase in the levels of LTB4 in nasal lavage (NAL) fluid following exposure in a pig house , .

        "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is primarily produced by activated neutrophils and plays a crucial role in neutrophilic inflammation. The context highlights that LTB4 levels are elevated in conditions characterized by neutrophilic inflammation, such as asthma and COPD. The study aims to measure LTB4 levels in a model of induced neutrophilic inflammation, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 production and neutrophil activity in inflammatory responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as LTB4 is produced by neutrophils and is directly involved in neutrophilic inflammation. The context emphasizes the role of LTB4 in recruiting neutrophils and its elevated levels in inflammatory conditions, establishing a critical relationship.",
        "score": 5
