    "context": "[4] Previous studies have shown a 75-fold increase in the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid  and a two- to 5.5-fold increase in the levels of LTB4 in nasal lavage (NAL) fluid following exposure in a pig house , . [5] It was therefore considered suitable to use the noninvasive EBC method to measure LTB4 levels in a study in which responses to pig house-dust and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were to be characterised. [6] For comparison, levels of immunoreactive LTB4 in induced sputum were measured in a subgroup of the subjects. [7] In addition, saliva was collected at baseline from another group of healthy subjects and immunoreactive levels of LTB4 as well as \u00ce\u00b1-amylase activity were measured. [1] A total of 34 healthy subjects, mean age 38\u00e2\u20ac\u2026yrs (range 22\u00e2\u20ac\u201c61), participated in the study. [2] None of the subjects had a history of asthma, allergy or other lung diseases and none had suffered from a respiratory tract infection during the week prior to the study. [1] All subjects were exposed to pig house-dust in a pig confinement building while weighing pigs for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026h and, on a separate day, were provoked with an LPS solution (53\u00e2\u20ac\u2026\u00ce\u00bcg) using a dosimeter controlled jet nebuliser (Spira Elektro 2; Intramedic, B\u00c3\u00a5lsta, Sweden).

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and amylase activity are both measured in saliva samples from healthy subjects. The study investigates LTB4 levels in response to exposure to pig house-dust and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while also assessing \u03b1-amylase activity. However, the relationship between LTB4 and amylase activity is not explicitly discussed, indicating that they are part of separate measurements without a direct interaction or functional link established in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both LTB4 and amylase activity are measured in the same study context, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association rather than a specific interaction.",
