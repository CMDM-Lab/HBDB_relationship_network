    "context": "[1] The stability of LTB4 in EBC and in saliva was studied. [2] Aliquots of EBC were supplied with 50\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1 of synthetic LTB4 (Cayman Chemical Company) and with saliva (1%). [3] The samples were stored at RT. Aliquots were kept at -70\u00c2\u00b0C immediately after LTB4 addition, as well as after 1, 2, 7 and 24\u00e2\u20ac\u2026h. [4] Aliquots were also stored at -20\u00c2\u00b0C for a long-term stability study, and LTB4 immunoreactivity was measured at regular intervals for 100\u00e2\u20ac\u2026days. [1] EBC (5\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mL) and saliva (5\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mL) were collected from one healthy subject. [2] Increasing amounts of saliva were added to EBC aliquots. [3] Immunoreactive LTB4, as well as \u00ce\u00b1-amylase activity, were measured as previously described. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is studied for its stability in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and saliva, with a focus on measuring its immunoreactivity over time. The research involves adding synthetic LTB4 to saliva and assessing the immunoreactive levels at various intervals, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and its immunoreactivity as a measurable parameter in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and immunoreactivity, as the study specifically measures the immunoreactive levels of LTB4 over time, demonstrating a clear relationship within the context of biochemical analysis.",
        "score": 4
