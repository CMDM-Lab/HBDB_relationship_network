    "context": "[7] However, as Marteus et al.  have concluded, the aerosol particles that are supposed to transport LTB4 from the airways may to a much greater extent remain in the exhaled air when formed in the very proximal (including the oropharyngeal tract) rather than the peripheral airways. [1] In conclusion, the findings of the present study support the hypothesis that the presence of leukotriene B4 in exhaled breath condensate is most likely to be due to salivary contamination. [2] The differences in levels of leukotriene B4 in exhaled breath condensate that have been reported between different groups of patients, or between patients and healthy controls, are generally relatively modest and may, as discussed, be explained by other mechanisms than true differences in recovery of leukotriene B4 from the lower airways. [3] It remains to be seen whether the present conclusion applies only to measurement of leukotriene B4 in exhaled breath condensate, but it is hypothesised that the salivary origin of material in exhaled breath condensate is likely to be a major confounding factor for all compounds that are secreted in relatively high quantities in the saliva. [4] In order to test this possibility, future measurements in exhaled breath condensate need to include a sensitive \u00ce\u00b1-amylase assay and measurements of the particular compound studied in saliva. [5] It is apparent that many publications reporting levels of leukotrienes in exhaled breath condensate do not present values on \u00ce\u00b1-amylase activity.  [1] Recently, inhibitory cytokine pathways for leukocyte chemoattraction and activation have been identified, but there is little insight into the operational mechanisms except for models that rely on simple receptor antagonism.

        "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath condensate, suggesting that its detection may be influenced by salivary contamination rather than originating solely from the lower airways. The study highlights the complexities of measuring LTB4 in exhaled air and indicates that the levels reported may not accurately reflect true differences in recovery from the airways, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of exhalation and salivary contributions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between leukotriene B4 and exhalation, as the context discusses the implications of measuring LTB4 in exhaled breath and the potential confounding factors involved. The relationship is supported by evidence regarding salivary contamination affecting LTB4 levels in exhaled air.",
