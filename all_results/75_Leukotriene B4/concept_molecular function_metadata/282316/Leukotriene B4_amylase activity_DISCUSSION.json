    "context": "[3] Many investigators who measure leukotrienes in EBC have considered this and therefore tested EBC for the presence of \u00ce\u00b1-amylase, an enzyme produced by salivary glands . [4] An \u00ce\u00b1-amylase activity below the detection limit of the particular assay used, \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc20\u00e2\u20ac\u2026U\u00c2\u00b7mL-1 in EBC , has been taken as evidence that there is no significant salivary contamination of the EBC and that the EBC sample exclusively contains material from the lower airways. [5] The results of the present study, however, call into question the capacity of measurement of \u00ce\u00b1-amylase in EBC with a standard assay to exclude saliva contamination of the EBC sample. [1] In the present study, levels of LTB4 (140\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1,358\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1) and \u00ce\u00b1-amylase activity (147\u00e2\u20ac\u201c807\u00e2\u20ac\u2026U\u00c2\u00b7mL-1) in saliva were measured in a group of healthy volunteers (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u016017). [2] Also using another method, \u00ce\u00b1-amylase activity in saliva has been found to be highly variable (3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c423\u00e2\u20ac\u2026U\u00c2\u00b7mL-1; n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u016075) . [3] Thus, the amylase method originally developed for measurement in saliva is not adequate to detect saliva contamination in EBC. [4] Therefore, a more sensitive assay was developed with a detection limit of 0.078\u00e2\u20ac\u2026U\u00c2\u00b7mL-1. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and amylase activity are both measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess potential salivary contamination. The study highlights that while LTB4 levels and amylase activity are quantified in saliva, the variability in amylase activity raises concerns about its reliability as a marker for excluding saliva contamination in EBC samples. Thus, the relationship is primarily focused on the methodological implications of measuring these substances together rather than a direct biological interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both LTB4 and amylase activity are analyzed in the same study context, but their relationship is more about methodological concerns regarding contamination rather than a direct biochemical interaction.",
        "score": 3
