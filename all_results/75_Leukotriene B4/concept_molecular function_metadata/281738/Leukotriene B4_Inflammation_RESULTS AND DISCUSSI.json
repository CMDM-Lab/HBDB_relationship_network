    "context": "[2] Incubation of eosinophils with pertussis toxin (PT), to block G\u00ce\u00b1i/0-coupled chemoattractant receptors, completely abolished eosinophil accumulation around worms (Fig. 2 E). [3] Next, we mixed equal numbers of differentially labeled PT-treated and control eosinophils and observed their migration. [4] Although control cells migrated robustly toward C. elegans, PT-treated eosinophils failed to migrate toward the same worms, demonstrating that the effect of PT was intrinsic to the treated eosinophils (Fig. 2 F and Video 4). [1] Neutrophils attract other neutrophils via LTB4 in vitro , as well as in several models of inflammation (; ). [2] We found that MK886, a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor , prevented the accumulation of eosinophils around C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc0.5 \u00c2\u00b5M; Fig. 3 A). [3] Furthermore, eosinophils derived from Alox5\u00e2\u02c6\u2019/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 bone marrow (Fig. 3 B) were >90% impaired in accumulating around C. elegans and N. brasiliensis (Fig. 3, C and D). [4] To determine whether paracrine leukotriene signaling accounted for eosinophil migration toward nematodes, we attempted to rescue the migration of Alox5\u00e2\u02c6\u2019/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 cells by mixing in wild-type cells.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant mediator in the inflammatory response, particularly in the recruitment of eosinophils during inflammation. The study demonstrates that LTB4 facilitates the accumulation of eosinophils around nematodes, indicating its role in promoting inflammatory cell migration. Additionally, the use of a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor (MK886) further supports the connection between LTB4 and inflammation, as it prevented eosinophil accumulation, underscoring LTB4's critical role in the inflammatory process.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between Leukotriene B4 and inflammation, as the context provides clear evidence of LTB4's role in eosinophil migration and accumulation during inflammatory responses, supported by experimental data.",
