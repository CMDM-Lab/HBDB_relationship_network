    "context": "[13] ng/10(6) cells, respectively) compared with normal controls (17.2 (6.0-38.0) [14] ng/10(6) cells). [15] The plasma thiol concentration was shown to be significantly lower in patients with SSc and VWF (445 (375-475) and 450 (417-510) mumol/l, respectively) compared with normal controls (480 (418-555) mumol/l). [16] Our results show increased leukotriene B4 production and increased free radical activity in patients with SSc and VWF. [17] Although previous indirect evidence has suggested increased WBC activity in patients with SSc, this is reported directly here for the first time. [18] In addition, the possibility of an inflammatory process occurring in patients with VWF, as shown here, has not previously been studied. [19] This may be a further mechanism to explain the poor circulation in the fingers of these patients. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 is directly linked to increased leukotriene production in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) abnormalities. The study reports elevated levels of leukotriene B4 and suggests a potential inflammatory process contributing to poor circulation in these patients. This indicates a clear and significant relationship between the two terms, as increased production of leukotriene B4 is a measurable outcome in the studied conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly states that increased leukotriene B4 production is observed in patients with SSc and VWF, establishing a direct and critical relationship between the two terms.",
        "score": 5
