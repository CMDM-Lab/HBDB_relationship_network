    "context": "No differerence in median exhaled LTB4 values was observed between asthmatic children who were treated with the higher dose of fluticasone, atopic non-asthmatic children (p =0.15) and healthy controls (p =0.10), whereas exhaled LTB4 values were elevated in asthmatic children who were receiving the lower dose of inhaled fluticasone (atopic non-asthmatic children: p <0.005; healthy children: p <0.001). A major unknown peak that has to be identified was observed in all samples obtained from steroid-na\u00efve asthmatic children (Fig. 6), healthy children (Fig. 6), and atopic non-asthmatic children (not shown), whereas it was not always present in steroid-treated children with asthma. There was no correlation between exhaled LTB4 and exhaled NO values in any study group. There was no correlation between exhaled LTB4 or exhaled NO and age, sex, or lung function in any study group. LC/MS/MS can also be used for measuring LTB4 concentrations in EBC in adults with asthma as shown in Fig. 8 .LC/ESI\u2212-MS/MS measurement of 8-isoprostane and cysteinyl-leukotrienes In the ESI\u2212 spectra, [M\u2212H]\u2212 were observed at m/z 353 and m/z 357, respectively. These precursor ions were used for the quantification of 8-isoprostane in the MRM mode. In the ESI\u2212-MS/MS spectra of 8-isoprostane and 8-isoprostane-d4, the fragment ions at m/z 193 and m/z 197 were selected for MRM. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to respiratory physiology, particularly in asthmatic children. The study measures exhaled LTB4 levels to assess inflammation and response to fluticasone treatment. Elevated LTB4 levels in steroid-na\u00efve asthmatic children suggest its role in respiratory pathophysiology, although no correlation with lung function or other respiratory markers was found.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and respiratory physiology, as LTB4 is implicated in asthma inflammation and treatment response. The study provides evidence of elevated LTB4 in specific patient groups, indicating its relevance in respiratory health.",
        "score": 4
