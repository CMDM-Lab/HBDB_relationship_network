    "context": "As asthma is mainly a chronic inflammatory airway disease, evidence of ongoing airway inflammation in asthmatic children with no current symptoms and well mantained lung function may suggest that pharmacological treatment is required. Children with asthma who were receiving inhaled glucococorticoids had lower exhaled LTB4 values than steroid-naive asthmatic children, but this difference was significant only in children who were treated with the higher dose of fluticasone (200\u03bcg/day for at least 8 weeks). These results might be explained by the fact that the lower dose of fluticasone was not able to decrease LTB4 values in EBC in children with asthma, although the observational design of the study precludes definitive conclusions. Large controlled studies are required to establish the effects of inhaled glucocorticoids and other anti-inflammatory drugs for asthma on LTB4 concentrations in EBC in children with asthma. Using LC/ESI\u2212-MS/MS, other authors have shown that 8-isoprostane, a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation, can be accurately quantified in EBC in healthy subjects and in patients with asbestosis and silicosis. Using this technique, this group reported elevated oxidative stress in patients with asbestosis and silicosis as reflected by 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC. The same authors have modified this technique for performing parallel measurement of cysteinyl-LTs, but there is a relative lack of information on the analytical procedures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to asthma, a condition that affects inspiration function due to airway inflammation. The study indicates that children with asthma receiving inhaled glucocorticoids had lower exhaled LTB4 levels, suggesting a potential link between LTB4 levels and the management of airway inflammation, which can impact respiratory function. However, the direct relationship between LTB4 and inspiration function is not explicitly detailed, focusing instead on the broader implications for asthma treatment.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTB4 is implicated in asthma-related inflammation, which affects inspiration function. However, the context does not provide a direct or detailed connection between LTB4 levels and specific measures of inspiration function.",
