    "context": "In the methodological study, we identified the chromatographic behavior and the MS2 fragmentation of LTB4 in the EBC. The ESI mass spectra in negative ion polarity mode revealed a base peak at m/z 335 for endogenous LTB4 and m/z 339 for internal standard LTB4-d4, corresponding to [M\u2212H]\u2212 ions. To confirm the presence of LTB4 in EBC, this eicosanoid was also detected in MS/MS mode which has a higher specificity. In line with previous studies, one of the most abundant product ion was observed at m/z 195 following collisional activation of the carboxylate anion [M\u2212H]\u2212 of LTB4  . The origin of this ion involves double bond rearrangement initiated by the collisional process followed by carbon-carbon bond cleavage. The proposed mechanism for LTB4 fragmentation involves a cyclization of the conjugated triene to a cyclic diene followed by a complex series of rearrangements, abstraction of the carbon-5 proton by a carbon-12 alkoxide anion or even the carboxylate anion, and formation of anionic site at carbon-11 that undergo a proton shift to form the more stable oxygen-centered anion. The resulting product has the structural characteristics required for a charge-driven \u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-ene fragmentation frequently observed for eicosanoids [22\u201324]. ",
