    "context": "LC/MS/MS is the reference analytical technique for identifying and quantifying eicosanoid concentrations in the EBC. Another avantage of the LC/MS/MS analysis of LTB4 in EBC is that this technique could be exploited for validation of immunoassays for LTB4. When we used a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, the LOQ for LTB4 was 50pg/ml. Although substantially improved when compared with the ion trap technique, this LOQ could be insufficient for quantifying LTB4 concentrations in EBC in some healthy subjects or in patients with a mild degree of airway inflammation. It is important to point out that in this study EBC samples were not concentrated. Collecting large EBC volumes in order to increase sample concentration could overcome this problem. However, this may not be feasible, particularly in patients with severe airway inflammatory diseases or in children. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed as an eicosanoid that can be quantified in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using LC/MS/MS techniques. The analysis of LTB4 is relevant for assessing airway inflammation, as its concentrations may indicate the degree of inflammatory response in patients. The study highlights the challenges in quantifying LTB4 in healthy subjects and those with mild airway inflammation, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for inflammation severity in respiratory conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and inflammation, as LTB4 is a known mediator of inflammatory processes. The context discusses its quantification in relation to airway inflammation, indicating a clear relationship supported by the analytical methods used.",
