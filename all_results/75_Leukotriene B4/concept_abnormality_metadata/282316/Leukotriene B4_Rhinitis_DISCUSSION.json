    "context": "[6] However, in that particular study, LTB4 levels dropped to 92% of the original immunoreactivity after the third week, which was within the range of the reported interassay variability of 15%. [1] There is data supporting the hypothesis that turbulent flow enhances recovery of some compounds in EBC . [2] The differences in LTB4 levels in EBC between different patient groups might also reflect events in the upper airways and oral cavity. [3] LTB4 is the major leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa , and there is a significant comorbidity between asthma and rhinitis. [4] Cap et al.  reported higher leukotriene levels in EBC in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis as compared with controls. [5] Another factor could be that most patients with COPD are smokers and smokers have increased prevalence of periodontitis. [6] Interestingly, in the aforementioned study by Kostikas et al. , the levels of LTB4 in the EBC of smokers without COPD were found to be high. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a major leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa, with elevated levels observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis compared to controls. This suggests a significant role of LTB4 in the inflammatory processes associated with rhinitis, particularly in the context of its comorbidity with asthma. The data indicates that LTB4 levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may reflect underlying inflammatory events in the upper airways related to rhinitis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and rhinitis, supported by evidence of elevated LTB4 levels in patients with allergic rhinitis. This indicates a clear relationship within the context of inflammation and respiratory conditions.",
