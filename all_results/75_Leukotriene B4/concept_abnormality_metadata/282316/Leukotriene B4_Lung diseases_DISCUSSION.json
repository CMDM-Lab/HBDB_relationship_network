    "context": "[7] There are also indications from measurements of other substances that the oropharyngeal tract contributes to the contents of EBC. [8] In fact, a recent study by Marteus et al.  showed that nitrite from saliva is an important contaminant of EBC collections. [1] The present data support the hypothesis that LTB4 in EBC from healthy volunteers derives predominantly from saliva. [2] Low or undetectable levels of LTB4 in EBC from healthy controls have been reported with elevated levels in subjects with different lung diseases. [3] LTB4 was not detected in \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc100 EBC samples in the present study, whereas high levels of LTB4 were measured in induced sputum samples collected before and after the exposure. [4] As in preliminary studies (see Methods) the present authors had also used the ECoScreen condenser, with similar negative results, the present data are not likely to be related to the collection system. [5] These findings, therefore, call into question the appropriateness of EBC as a relevant sample to assess mediators in the lower airways, at least in the case of LTB4. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and its elevated levels in subjects with various lung diseases. The study indicates that while LTB4 is not detected in healthy controls, it is found in higher concentrations in individuals with lung diseases, suggesting a potential role of LTB4 as a biomarker for inflammation or disease severity in these conditions. This relationship highlights the significance of LTB4 in the context of lung pathology.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and lung diseases, supported by evidence of elevated LTB4 levels in diseased subjects compared to healthy controls. This suggests a clear relationship, although the exact mechanisms and implications require further exploration.",
