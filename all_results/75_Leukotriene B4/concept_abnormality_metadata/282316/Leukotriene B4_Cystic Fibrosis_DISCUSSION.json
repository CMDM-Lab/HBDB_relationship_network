    "context": "[3] In a parallel experiment, LTB4 levels in saliva were found to be high (140\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1,358\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1) in healthy volunteers. [4] Through use of a sensitive method for measurement of \u00ce\u00b1-amylase in EBC, it was found that all samples that were positive for LTB4 also contained \u00ce\u00b1-amylase. [5] Therefore, it was concluded that saliva is a possible source of LTB4 in EBC. [1] LTB4 levels in EBC have been reported to be increased in several respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD  and cystic fibrosis . [2] The levels reported are generally in the 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c130\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1 concentration range, although, in more recent publications, the data are expressed as amounts of LTB4 obtained during a defined time period of tidal breathing . [3] The vast majority of published papers report on LTB4-like immunoreactivity (LTB4-IR) by the use of EIA measurements, but a recent paper by Montuschi et al.  validated the measurements of LTB4 with mass spectrometry. [4] There is, thus, no doubt that LTB4 may be present in EBC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a biomarker that is elevated in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with cystic fibrosis, among other respiratory diseases. The study indicates that LTB4 levels are significantly higher in cystic fibrosis, suggesting its potential role in the inflammatory processes associated with the disease. The presence of LTB4 in EBC may serve as a noninvasive indicator of disease activity in cystic fibrosis patients.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and cystic fibrosis, as elevated LTB4 levels in EBC are specifically noted in cystic fibrosis patients, indicating its relevance in the disease's inflammatory response. However, while the relationship is strong, further mechanistic details are not fully explored.",
