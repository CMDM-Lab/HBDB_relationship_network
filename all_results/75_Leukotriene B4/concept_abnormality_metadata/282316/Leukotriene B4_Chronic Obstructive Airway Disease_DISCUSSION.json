    "context": "[3] LTB4 is the major leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa , and there is a significant comorbidity between asthma and rhinitis. [4] Cap et al.  reported higher leukotriene levels in EBC in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis as compared with controls. [5] Another factor could be that most patients with COPD are smokers and smokers have increased prevalence of periodontitis. [6] Interestingly, in the aforementioned study by Kostikas et al. , the levels of LTB4 in the EBC of smokers without COPD were found to be high. [7] There are also indications from measurements of other substances that the oropharyngeal tract contributes to the contents of EBC. [8] In fact, a recent study by Marteus et al.  showed that nitrite from saliva is an important contaminant of EBC collections. [1] The present data support the hypothesis that LTB4 in EBC from healthy volunteers derives predominantly from saliva. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is mentioned as a significant leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa, with elevated levels observed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with respiratory conditions like asthma and rhinitis. While there is a noted comorbidity between asthma and Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD), the direct relationship between LTB4 and COPD is not explicitly detailed. The context suggests a potential link through inflammation, but lacks specific evidence connecting LTB4 levels directly to COPD pathology.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTB4 is implicated in respiratory conditions, including asthma and potentially COPD, but the context does not provide strong evidence or direct discussion of LTB4's role in COPD specifically.",
        "score": 3
