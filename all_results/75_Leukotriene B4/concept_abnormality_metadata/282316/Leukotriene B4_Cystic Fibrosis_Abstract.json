    "context": "[1] Leukotriene (LT)B4 is a potent chemotactic mediator that may be involved in several inflammatory reactions in the lungs and airways , . [2] LTB4 is produced predominantly by activated neutrophils, but also by alveolar macrophages and in transcellular reactions involving inflammatory cells and surrounding structural elements . [3] In addition to recruiting neutrophils and causing increased microvascular permeability , LTB4 may stimulate lymphocyte migration in the lung  and constriction of pulmonary blood vessels via indirect mechanisms . [4] In comparison with healthy subjects, the LTB4 levels have been reported to be elevated in EBC collected from subjects with asthma , cystic fibrosis  and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . [1] The primary aim of the present study was to measure the levels of immunoreactive LTB4 in EBC collected in a human model where a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation was induced . [2] The model involves a standardised exposure of healthy subjects in a pig house for 3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026h. [3] This challenge results in a two- to three-fold increase in bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, and an associated intense airway neutrophilic inflammation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant chemotactic mediator involved in inflammatory responses in the lungs, with elevated levels observed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from cystic fibrosis patients. This suggests a direct relationship where LTB4 may play a role in the inflammatory processes associated with cystic fibrosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease severity and inflammation in affected individuals.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and cystic fibrosis, as elevated LTB4 levels are specifically noted in cystic fibrosis patients, indicating a critical role in the disease's inflammatory response.",
        "score": 5
