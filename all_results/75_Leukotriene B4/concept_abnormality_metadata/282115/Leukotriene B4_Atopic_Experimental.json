    "context": "In the first study, the primary objective was to ascertain whether LC/MS and/or LC/MS/MS analysis could be used to measure LTB4 in EBC and to establish the best analytical conditions. Ion trap mass spectrometer was used for LTB4 analysis. This study will be called methodological study throughout the text. In the second study, a modified LC/MS/MS technique was applied to the measurement of LTB4 in EBC in atopic asthmatic children, atopic non-asthmatic children and healthy children. A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for LC/MS/MS analysis of LTB4 in EBC. This study will be called observational study in children with asthma. Both studies were of cross-sectional design. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of atopic asthmatic children, atopic non-asthmatic children, and healthy children. The studies aim to establish the presence and measurement of LTB4, which is relevant in understanding its role in atopic conditions, particularly asthma. The focus on atopic children indicates a direct relationship between LTB4 and atopic asthma, suggesting that LTB4 may be a significant biomarker in this population.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and atopic conditions, particularly asthma, as the studies specifically measure LTB4 levels in atopic children. This indicates a clear relevance in understanding the role of LTB4 in atopic asthma, supported by the methodological approach of the studies.",
        "score": 4
