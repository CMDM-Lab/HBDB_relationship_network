    "context": "This analytical methodology is suitable for an accurate quantitative assessment of LTB4 concentrations in EBC. A LC/MS/MS technique for the measurement of 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC has been developed and can be used as an alternative to GC/MS. The LC/MS/MS technique for 8-isoprostane has been adapted for parallel measurement of cysteinyl-LTs in EBC, although more methodological information is required. Measurement of LTB4 and other eicosanoids in EBC with LC/MS/MS could be used for non-invasive assessment of airway inflmmation, is potentially useful for longitudinal studies in patients with inflammatory airway diseases and occupational exposure, and for monitoring the effect of pharmacological therapy. [1] We investigated the effects of a \u00ce\u00b3-tocopherol\u00e2\u20ac\u201crich mixture of tocopherols (\u00ce\u00b3-TmT, containing 57% \u00ce\u00b3-T, 24% \u00ce\u00b4-T, and 13% \u00ce\u00b1-T) on colon carcinogenesis in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctreated mice. [2] In experiment 1, 6-week-old male CF-1 mice were given a dose of AOM (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), and 1 week later, 1.5% DSS in drinking water for 1 week. [3] The mice were maintained on either a \u00ce\u00b3-TmT (0.3%)\u00e2\u20ac\u201cenriched or a standard AIN93M diet, starting 1 week before the AOM injection, until the termination of experiment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a biomarker for airway inflammation, particularly in patients with inflammatory airway diseases. The measurement of LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using advanced analytical techniques is proposed as a non-invasive method to assess and monitor inflammation associated with various inflammatory disorders. This suggests a direct relevance of LTB4 in the context of inflammatory conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and inflammatory disorders, as LTB4 is specifically mentioned as a marker for assessing airway inflammation, indicating its role in monitoring and understanding inflammatory conditions.",
        "score": 4
