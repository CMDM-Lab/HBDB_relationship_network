    "context": "Compared with healthy children, LTB4 values in EBC were selectively elevated in steroid-na\u00efve children with atopic asthma, but not in atopic non-asthmatic children and in atopic asthmatic children who were treated with inhaled glucocorticoids. Higher degree of airway inflammation in steroid-na\u00efve children with asthma was confirmed by elevated exhaled NO levels in these children. These results indicate that measurement of LTB4 in EBC can be used as a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation in steroid-naive children with asthma. However, LTB4 levels in EBC and exhaled NO are likely to reflect different aspects of airway inflammation as indicated by their different behaviour in atopic non-asthmatic children. As asthma is mainly a chronic inflammatory airway disease, evidence of ongoing airway inflammation in asthmatic children with no current symptoms and well mantained lung function may suggest that pharmacological treatment is required. Children with asthma who were receiving inhaled glucococorticoids had lower exhaled LTB4 values than steroid-naive asthmatic children, but this difference was significant only in children who were treated with the higher dose of fluticasone (200\u03bcg/day for at least 8 weeks). These results might be explained by the fact that the lower dose of fluticasone was not able to decrease LTB4 values in EBC in children with asthma, although the observational design of the study precludes definitive conclusions.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a biomarker for airway inflammation in steroid-na\u00efve children with atopic asthma. Elevated LTB4 levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) were observed in these children compared to healthy controls, indicating a significant relationship between LTB4 and atopic asthma. The study suggests that LTB4 measurement can help assess airway inflammation, particularly in atopic children with asthma who are not receiving glucocorticoid treatment.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and atopic asthma, as the context provides clear evidence of elevated LTB4 levels in steroid-na\u00efve asthmatic children, indicating its role as a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation in this specific atopic condition.",
        "score": 5
