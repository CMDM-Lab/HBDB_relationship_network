    "context": "As asthma is mainly a chronic inflammatory airway disease, evidence of ongoing airway inflammation in asthmatic children with no current symptoms and well mantained lung function may suggest that pharmacological treatment is required. Children with asthma who were receiving inhaled glucococorticoids had lower exhaled LTB4 values than steroid-naive asthmatic children, but this difference was significant only in children who were treated with the higher dose of fluticasone (200\u03bcg/day for at least 8 weeks). These results might be explained by the fact that the lower dose of fluticasone was not able to decrease LTB4 values in EBC in children with asthma, although the observational design of the study precludes definitive conclusions. Large controlled studies are required to establish the effects of inhaled glucocorticoids and other anti-inflammatory drugs for asthma on LTB4 concentrations in EBC in children with asthma. Using LC/ESI\u2212-MS/MS, other authors have shown that 8-isoprostane, a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation, can be accurately quantified in EBC in healthy subjects and in patients with asbestosis and silicosis. Using this technique, this group reported elevated oxidative stress in patients with asbestosis and silicosis as reflected by 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC. The same authors have modified this technique for performing parallel measurement of cysteinyl-LTs, but there is a relative lack of information on the analytical procedures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to asthma, particularly in how its levels are affected by inhaled glucocorticoid treatment in asthmatic children. The study indicates that children receiving higher doses of fluticasone exhibited lower exhaled LTB4 values compared to those who were steroid-naive, suggesting a potential role of LTB4 in asthma inflammation and the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in managing airway inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and asthma, as the context provides evidence of LTB4 levels being influenced by glucocorticoid treatment in asthmatic children, indicating its relevance in asthma management and inflammation.",
        "score": 4
