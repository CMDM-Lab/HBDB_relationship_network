    "context": "From the structural point of view, LTs are conjugated triene compounds containing a linear-20 carbon chain. Leukotriene (LT) B4 (5S,6Z,8E,10E,12R,14Z)-5,12-dihydroxyeicosa-6,8,10,14-tetraenoic acid (Fig. 1 ), a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, has been involved in the pathophysiology of inflammatory airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and asthma exacerbation, whereas its role in less severe chronic stable asthma is less known. Cysteinyl (Cys)-LTs are important inflammatory mediators in asthma and selective CysLT1 receptor antagonists are currently used in asthma therapy. The development of a robust analytical technique for the quantitative assessment of LTB4 concentrations in biological fluids is essential for establishing the pathophysiological role of LTB4 in patients with pulmonary diseases and the potential utility of its measurement for assessing the effects of pharmacological intervention. In patients with respiratory diseases, LTB4 has been detected in plasma, broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, and sputum. LTB4 concentrations have been measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) [7\u201310], a non-invasive method for collecting airway secretions and studying the composition of airway lining fluid. In most of these studies, LTB4 concentrations in EBC have been measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). ",

        "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a significant mediator in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. It acts as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, indicating its role in the inflammatory response associated with these lung diseases. The measurement of LTB4 concentrations in biological fluids is crucial for understanding its involvement in pulmonary diseases and evaluating therapeutic interventions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between LTB4 and lung diseases, as LTB4 is explicitly linked to the pathophysiology of several respiratory conditions, supported by evidence of its presence in biological fluids related to these diseases.",
