    "context": "LTB4 concentrations have been measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) [7\u201310], a non-invasive method for collecting airway secretions and studying the composition of airway lining fluid. In most of these studies, LTB4 concentrations in EBC have been measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Mass spectrometry techniques are considered the gold standard as they are highly specific and generally sufficiently sensitive. We have used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for measuring LTB4 concentrations in EBC in adults and children with asthma and healthy controls. However, definitive conclusions on the specificity of this method are precluded by the fact that arachidonic acid was used as internal standard. Arachidonic acid is chemically different from LTB4 and may behave differently during sample pre-treatment. Unlike GC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) does not require the two-step derivatization procedure resulting in three advantages: (1) increased recovery, (2) shorter time required for sample pre-treatment, and (3) lack of formation of incomplete derivatization by-products.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential biomarker for asthma. The study employs gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure LTB4 concentrations in both asthma patients and healthy controls. The focus on LTB4 in relation to asthma suggests its relevance in understanding airway inflammation and disease mechanisms, although the specificity of measurement methods is noted as a limitation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and asthma, as LTB4 is being measured specifically in asthma patients to explore its role in airway inflammation. The context provides evidence of its relevance, although some methodological limitations are acknowledged.",
        "score": 4
