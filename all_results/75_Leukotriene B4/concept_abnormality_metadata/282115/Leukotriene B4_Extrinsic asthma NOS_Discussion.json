    "context": "This made it possibile to perform a quantitative analysis of LTB4 concentrations in EBC in MS2 mode with increased specifity of the technique. In analogy to previous studies, the transition 335\u2192195 m/z was used for measuring LTB4 in EBC. This study provides an example of the possibility to apply this technique to the assessment of airway inflammation in children with asthma. Compared with healthy children, LTB4 values in EBC were selectively elevated in steroid-na\u00efve children with atopic asthma, but not in atopic non-asthmatic children and in atopic asthmatic children who were treated with inhaled glucocorticoids. Higher degree of airway inflammation in steroid-na\u00efve children with asthma was confirmed by elevated exhaled NO levels in these children. These results indicate that measurement of LTB4 in EBC can be used as a non-invasive marker of airway inflammation in steroid-naive children with asthma. However, LTB4 levels in EBC and exhaled NO are likely to reflect different aspects of airway inflammation as indicated by their different behaviour in atopic non-asthmatic children. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed as a potential non-invasive biomarker for airway inflammation in children with extrinsic asthma (atopic asthma). The study shows that LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are significantly elevated in steroid-na\u00efve children with asthma compared to healthy controls and other groups, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 levels and the inflammatory processes associated with extrinsic asthma. This suggests that LTB4 could play a critical role in the pathophysiology of this condition.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and extrinsic asthma, as the study provides clear evidence of elevated LTB4 levels in children with this specific type of asthma, indicating its potential as a biomarker for airway inflammation.",
        "score": 5
