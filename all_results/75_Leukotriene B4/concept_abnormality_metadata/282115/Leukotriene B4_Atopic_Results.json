    "context": "Among steroid-treated atopic children with asthma, children who were receiving the lower dose of inhaled fluticasone (100\u03bcg/day at a constant dose for at least 8 weeks) had higher exhaled LTB4 values [245.0 (235.0\u2013282.5) pg, p <0.002] than those who were treated with the higher dose of inhaled fluticasone (200\u03bcg/day for at least 8 weeks) [25.0 (25.0\u2013102.5) pg] (Fig. 7B). No differerence in median exhaled LTB4 values was observed between asthmatic children who were treated with the higher dose of fluticasone, atopic non-asthmatic children (p =0.15) and healthy controls (p =0.10), whereas exhaled LTB4 values were elevated in asthmatic children who were receiving the lower dose of inhaled fluticasone (atopic non-asthmatic children: p <0.005; healthy children: p <0.001). A major unknown peak that has to be identified was observed in all samples obtained from steroid-na\u00efve asthmatic children (Fig. 6), healthy children (Fig. 6), and atopic non-asthmatic children (not shown), whereas it was not always present in steroid-treated children with asthma. There was no correlation between exhaled LTB4 and exhaled NO values in any study group. There was no correlation between exhaled LTB4 or exhaled NO and age, sex, or lung function in any study group.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is measured in exhaled breath of atopic children with asthma to assess its levels in relation to inhaled fluticasone treatment. The study finds that lower doses of fluticasone correlate with higher LTB4 levels in asthmatic children, indicating a potential link between LTB4 and the atopic condition in the context of asthma management. However, no significant differences in LTB4 levels were observed between atopic non-asthmatic children and healthy controls, suggesting that while LTB4 is relevant in asthma, its role in atopy may not be as pronounced.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and atopy, particularly in the context of asthma treatment. The study provides quantitative data showing differences in LTB4 levels based on fluticasone dosage, indicating a clear relationship within the context of atopic asthma management.",
