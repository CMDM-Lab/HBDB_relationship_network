    "context": "This lead to the assumption that the mutual structural characteristics could promote small molecule binding. Another important finding of the study of Cumano and Rajewsky was that the anti-NP antibodies show a tyrosine at position 99 and that following amino acids (100\u2013102) are relevant for idiotypic specificity. Important to note is that mAb S27BC6 is non-identical to the anti-NP specific antibodies in this same described specificity-affective region (see Fig.\u00a03) but this region could also be important for idiotypic specificity of mAb S27BC6. Motivated in the coherence of exalted LTB4 levels in EBC and different lung diseases leukotriene B4 can nowadays be claimed as biomarker for e.g. COPD, asthma or cystic fibrosis. Biomarkers are important tools in diagnostic approaches since they constitute early indicators for many diseases, in some cases even before the patients describe any symptoms. By now EBC is usually collected non-invasively with the help of breathing air condensers. ",

        "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker for various lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. Elevated levels of LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) suggest its role in the pathophysiology of these conditions, indicating that it may serve as an early diagnostic indicator even before symptoms manifest. This establishes a clear and direct relationship between LTB4 and lung diseases.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as LTB4 is directly linked to lung diseases through its role as a biomarker, supported by the context's emphasis on its diagnostic potential in conditions like COPD and asthma.",
        "score": 5
