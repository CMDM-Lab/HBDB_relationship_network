    "context": "Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems. Those systems capture LTB4 as target molecule by anti-LTB4 antisera from rabbit or chicken and are used nowadays in commercially available immunoassay test kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its increased concentrations found in the exhaled breath condensate of patients. The presence of LTB4 is associated with inflammatory responses in various pulmonary diseases, including COPD, suggesting its role in leukocyte attraction and inflammation in the airways. This relationship underscores the potential of LTB4 as a non-invasive diagnostic parameter for chronic obstructive airway disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and COPD, supported by evidence of increased LTB4 levels in patients with COPD. The context discusses its diagnostic potential, indicating a significant relationship in the realm of pulmonary disease.",
        "score": 4
