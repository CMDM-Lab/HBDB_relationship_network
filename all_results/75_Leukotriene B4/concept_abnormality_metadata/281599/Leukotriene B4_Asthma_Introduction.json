    "context": "Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems. Those systems capture LTB4 as target molecule by anti-LTB4 antisera from rabbit or chicken and are used nowadays in commercially available immunoassay test kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant molecule in the inflammatory response associated with asthma. Increased levels of LTB4 have been found in the exhaled breath condensate of asthma patients, suggesting its role in attracting leukocytes and potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of asthma. The presence of LTB4 in diagnostic tests indicates its relevance in monitoring pulmonary diseases, including asthma.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between LTB4 and asthma, as the context discusses the increased concentrations of LTB4 in asthma patients and its implications for diagnosis and disease monitoring, indicating a critical role in the inflammatory processes of asthma.",
        "score": 5
