    "context": "Thereby it shows different ways of signalling: Whereas it was also reported that LTB4 has gene regulatory effects by interacting with the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha its main regulatory function occurs likely via cell surface receptors. Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems.

        "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is closely associated with various inflammatory disorders, as evidenced by its increased levels in the secretions of conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). LTB4 functions through its receptors, primarily BLT1 and BLT2, to attract leukocytes and may play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) suggests its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing inflammatory pulmonary diseases.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between LTB4 and inflammatory disorders, supported by evidence of increased LTB4 levels in various inflammatory conditions and its role in leukocyte attraction, indicating its significance in the context of inflammation.",
        "score": 5
