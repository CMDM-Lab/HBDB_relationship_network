    "context": "Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems. Those systems capture LTB4 as target molecule by anti-LTB4 antisera from rabbit or chicken and are used nowadays in commercially available immunoassay test kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA). In spite of many disadvantages (e.g. differing affinities or specifications, mixed isotypes, unlasting amount of serum from one batch) EIA systems are still performed with polyclonal sera but not monoclonal antibodies.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in various lung diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased levels of LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) suggest its role in the inflammatory response associated with these conditions. The study indicates that LTB4 could serve as a valuable non-invasive diagnostic parameter for pulmonary diseases, emphasizing its relevance in the context of lung inflammation and disease progression.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between LTB4 and lung diseases, as the context discusses LTB4's significant increase in patients with various pulmonary conditions and its potential as a diagnostic marker, indicating a critical relationship.",
        "score": 5
