    "context": "Thereby it shows different ways of signalling: Whereas it was also reported that LTB4 has gene regulatory effects by interacting with the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha its main regulatory function occurs likely via cell surface receptors. Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in various inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis. The increased levels of LTB4 found in secretions from cystic fibrosis patients suggest its role in the inflammatory response associated with the disease. The study indicates that LTB4 may not only attract leukocytes but also serve as a diagnostic parameter for pulmonary diseases, emphasizing its relevance in cystic fibrosis pathology.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and cystic fibrosis, supported by evidence of increased LTB4 levels in cystic fibrosis secretions. This suggests a significant role of LTB4 in the inflammatory processes of the disease, although further mechanistic details are not fully explored.",
        "score": 4
