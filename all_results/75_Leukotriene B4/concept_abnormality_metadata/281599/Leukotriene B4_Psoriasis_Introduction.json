    "context": "Thereby it shows different ways of signalling: Whereas it was also reported that LTB4 has gene regulatory effects by interacting with the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha its main regulatory function occurs likely via cell surface receptors. Leukotriene B4 receptors 1 and 2 (BLT1 and BLT2) are G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptors for LTB4 with dissociation constants of 0.1\u20132\u00a0nM (BLT1) and around 22.7\u00a0nM (BLT2). BLT1 was found to be predominantly expressed on leukocytes whereas BLT2 occurs ubiquitously in several tissues like spleen, liver, ovary and also leucocytes [6\u20138]. Finding increased amounts of LTB4 in secretions of different inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, psoriasis or adult respiratory distress syndrome, lead to the assumption that the attraction of leukocytes is not the only role of LTB4. Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. The text discusses LTB4's role in signaling and its interaction with leukocyte receptors, suggesting that increased levels of LTB4 in secretions may contribute to the inflammatory processes observed in psoriasis. This indicates a potential link between LTB4 and the pathophysiology of psoriasis, although the specifics of this relationship are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTB4 is mentioned in relation to psoriasis among other inflammatory diseases, indicating a potential connection. However, the context does not provide detailed evidence or specific mechanisms linking LTB4 directly to psoriasis.",
        "score": 3
