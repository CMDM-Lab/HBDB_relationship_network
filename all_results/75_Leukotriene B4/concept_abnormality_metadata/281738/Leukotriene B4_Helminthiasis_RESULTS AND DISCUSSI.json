    "context": "[5] When we activated eosinophils with ionomycin, there was \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc10-fold more LTB4 than LTE4 in the supernatant (Fig. 4 B). [6] Furthermore, mixing of eosinophils with C. elegans stimulated eosinophil LTB4 production, which was completely inhibited by MK886 (Fig. 4 C). [7] In contrast, there was no detectable production of LTE4 by eosinophils in response to worms. [8] Finally, Ltb4r1\u00e2\u02c6\u2019/\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 eosinophils exhibited a >90% reduction in accumulation around worms (Fig. 4 D), establishing that LTB4 signaling is required for Alox5-dependent migration and accumulation.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to play a significant role in the migration and accumulation of eosinophils in response to helminth infection, specifically involving the nematode C. elegans. The study indicates that LTB4 production is stimulated by the presence of these worms, and its signaling is crucial for eosinophil recruitment, suggesting a direct relationship between LTB4 and the immune response to helminthiasis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between LTB4 and helminthiasis, as the context provides evidence of LTB4's role in eosinophil migration and accumulation in response to helminth infection, indicating a significant biological interaction.",
