    "context": "[1] Docking of LCA onto the BK \u00ce\u00b21 steroid-sensing site involves hydrogen bonding of the LCA hydroxyl group with Thr-169 and hydrophobic interactions of the LCA steroid nucleus with Leu-172 and Leu-173 (Fig. 5B) . [2] Although Ala-176 and Lys-179 are located in the vicinity of the LCA lateral chain, amino acid substitutions at these positions failed to affect LCA-induced BK channel activation . [3] Thus, Ala-176 and Lys-179 were ruled out as steroid-sensing amino acids. [1] Like LCA, docking of LTB4 onto the BK \u00ce\u00b21 TM2 domain's steroid-sensing site resulted in hydrogen bonding of one of the LTB4 hydroxyl groups with Thr-169 and placement of the LTB4 hydrocarbon chain on the hydrophobic surface formed by Leu-172 and Leu-173 (Fig. 5C, left). [2] Unlike LCA, docking of LTB4 yielded a very tight association of the LTB4 hydrocarbon chain with the receptor surface formed by Ala-176 (Fig. 5C, right). [3] LTB4 was also expected to form a hydrogen bond with Lys-179 (Fig. 5C, left). [4] Therefore, in addition to previously validated steroid-sensing residues Thr-169, Leu-172, and Leu-173, the additional residues Ala-176 and Lys-179 may participate in LTB4 recognition and retention by the BK \u00ce\u00b21 TM2.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its docking interactions with the BK \u03b21 receptor, specifically highlighting the role of its hydroxyl groups. One of the hydroxyl groups of LTB4 forms a hydrogen bond with the amino acid Thr-169, which is crucial for its binding and activation of the receptor. This interaction emphasizes the functional importance of the hydroxyl group in the biological activity of LTB4.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and its hydroxyl group, as the context provides evidence of a specific interaction (hydrogen bonding) that is critical for LTB4's function in receptor activation. This relationship is well-supported by the details provided in the docking study.",
