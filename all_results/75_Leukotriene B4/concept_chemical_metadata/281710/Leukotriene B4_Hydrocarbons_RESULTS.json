    "context": "[2] Although Ala-176 and Lys-179 are located in the vicinity of the LCA lateral chain, amino acid substitutions at these positions failed to affect LCA-induced BK channel activation . [3] Thus, Ala-176 and Lys-179 were ruled out as steroid-sensing amino acids. [1] Like LCA, docking of LTB4 onto the BK \u00ce\u00b21 TM2 domain's steroid-sensing site resulted in hydrogen bonding of one of the LTB4 hydroxyl groups with Thr-169 and placement of the LTB4 hydrocarbon chain on the hydrophobic surface formed by Leu-172 and Leu-173 (Fig. 5C, left). [2] Unlike LCA, docking of LTB4 yielded a very tight association of the LTB4 hydrocarbon chain with the receptor surface formed by Ala-176 (Fig. 5C, right). [3] LTB4 was also expected to form a hydrogen bond with Lys-179 (Fig. 5C, left). [4] Therefore, in addition to previously validated steroid-sensing residues Thr-169, Leu-172, and Leu-173, the additional residues Ala-176 and Lys-179 may participate in LTB4 recognition and retention by the BK \u00ce\u00b21 TM2. [1] To validate our computational results, we 1) applied a mixture of LTB4 and LCA onto the cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21 channels and 2) tested LTB4 on cbv1-\u00ce\u00b21 complexes that contained substitutions of amino acids that conform the docking site.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its hydrocarbon chain, which plays a crucial role in its docking and interaction with the BK \u03b21 TM2 domain. The study highlights how the hydrocarbon chain of LTB4 associates tightly with specific receptor residues, indicating a significant structural relationship between LTB4 and hydrocarbons. This suggests that the hydrocarbon component is essential for LTB4's recognition and binding to the receptor, emphasizing its functional importance in biochemical interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and hydrocarbons, as the hydrocarbon chain of LTB4 is critical for its binding to the receptor. The context provides evidence of this interaction, indicating a clear biochemical relationship.",
