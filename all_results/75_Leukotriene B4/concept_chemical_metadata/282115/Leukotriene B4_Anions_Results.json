    "context": "The intraclass correlation coefficient, expressing between-day variations in LTB4 measurements in EBC, was 0.89. Quantitative analysis of LTB4 in EBC was performed in MS2 mode in order to increase specificity. The mass spectra of LTB4 and internal standard LTB4-d4 showed a base peak at m/z 335 for endogenous LTB4 and m/z 339 for internal standard LTB4-d4, corresponding to molecular ions. The most abundant product ions obtained by collision-induced decomposition of the carboxylate anion [M\u2212H]\u2212 derived from LTB4 following ESI were m/z 195 and 317 (Fig. 5 ). To measure LTB4 in EBC, after fragmentation of the parent ions m/z 335 (endogenous LTB4) and m/z 339 (deuterated internal standard) with a collision energy of 17 and 19%, respectively, the transition 335\u2192195 m/z and 339\u2192197 m/z was monitored (Fig. 6 ). \u03b1-Amylase concentrations (<22mU/ml) were not detected in any study sample, excluding significant salivary contamination. LTB4 concentrations in EBC were detected in all study samples except for 7 steroid naive atopic children with asthma who were receiving the higher dose of inhaled fluticasone (200\u03bcg/day) (Fig. 7A).

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using mass spectrometry, where it is detected as a carboxylate anion [M\u2212H]\u2212. The study focuses on the fragmentation of LTB4 to produce specific anions (m/z 195 and 317) during the analysis process. This indicates a direct relationship between LTB4 and anions, as LTB4 is measured in its anionic form during the quantitative analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and anions, as the analysis of LTB4 involves its conversion to an anion for mass spectrometric detection, demonstrating a clear functional relationship in the context of biochemical measurement.",
        "score": 4
