    "context": "To confirm the presence of LTB4 in EBC, this eicosanoid was also detected in MS/MS mode which has a higher specificity. In line with previous studies, one of the most abundant product ion was observed at m/z 195 following collisional activation of the carboxylate anion [M\u2212H]\u2212 of LTB4  . The origin of this ion involves double bond rearrangement initiated by the collisional process followed by carbon-carbon bond cleavage. The proposed mechanism for LTB4 fragmentation involves a cyclization of the conjugated triene to a cyclic diene followed by a complex series of rearrangements, abstraction of the carbon-5 proton by a carbon-12 alkoxide anion or even the carboxylate anion, and formation of anionic site at carbon-11 that undergo a proton shift to form the more stable oxygen-centered anion. The resulting product has the structural characteristics required for a charge-driven \u03b1-hydroxy-\u03b2-ene fragmentation frequently observed for eicosanoids [22\u201324]. However, in our methodological study, the sensitivity of the LTB4 measurement with the ion trap in MS2 mode was insuffcient for quantitative purposes. For this reason, ion trap analysis of LTB4 concentrations in EBC was performed in MS1 mode. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to confirm its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The fragmentation mechanism of LTB4 involves the rearrangement and cleavage of bonds, which is influenced by protons during the ionization process. Protons play a critical role in the formation of stable anions during the fragmentation of LTB4, indicating a direct relationship between the two in the context of mass spectrometric analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and protons, as protons are essential for the ionization and fragmentation processes of LTB4 in mass spectrometry. The context provides a detailed mechanism showing how protons influence the analysis of LTB4, indicating a strong relevance.",
