    "context": "LTB4 and LTB4-d4 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals Co (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use. Chemical purity of LTB4-d4 was \u226597% and the deuterium incorporation was \u22651%. The working solutions were prepared daily using mobile phase as solvent. In the study aiming at measuring 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-isoprostane or 15-F2t-isoprostane), [3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032, 2H4] 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 and 8-isoprostane affinity sorbent were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; triethylamine (99.5%) and ammonium hydroxide (28% NH3 solution in water) were obtained from Aldrich, USA; acetonitrile, water, methanol (LC/MS grade), acetic acid (99.9%) and formic acid (98\u2013100%) were obtained from Riedel de Haen, Germany.Study design Two studies were performed for identifying and quantifying LTB4 in EBC. In the first study, the primary objective was to ascertain whether LC/MS and/or LC/MS/MS analysis could be used to measure LTB4 in EBC and to establish the best analytical conditions. Ion trap mass spectrometer was used for LTB4 analysis. This study will be called methodological study throughout the text. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is mentioned as a chemical purchased from Cayman Chemicals Co., indicating its role as a specific compound in the study. The context discusses various chemicals used in the analysis of LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), highlighting the importance of chemical purity and analytical methods. However, the relationship between LTB4 and the broader category of chemicals is primarily one of inclusion rather than interaction or functional relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as LTB4 is categorized as a chemical used in the study, but there is no detailed discussion of its interactions or significance relative to other chemicals mentioned.",
