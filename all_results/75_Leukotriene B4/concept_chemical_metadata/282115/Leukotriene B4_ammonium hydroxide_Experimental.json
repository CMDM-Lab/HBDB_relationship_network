    "context": "LTB4 and LTB4-d4 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals Co (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use. Chemical purity of LTB4-d4 was \u226597% and the deuterium incorporation was \u22651%. The working solutions were prepared daily using mobile phase as solvent. In the study aiming at measuring 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-isoprostane or 15-F2t-isoprostane), [3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032, 2H4] 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 and 8-isoprostane affinity sorbent were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; triethylamine (99.5%) and ammonium hydroxide (28% NH3 solution in water) were obtained from Aldrich, USA; acetonitrile, water, methanol (LC/MS grade), acetic acid (99.9%) and formic acid (98\u2013100%) were obtained from Riedel de Haen, Germany.Study design Two studies were performed for identifying and quantifying LTB4 in EBC. In the first study, the primary objective was to ascertain whether LC/MS and/or LC/MS/MS analysis could be used to measure LTB4 in EBC and to establish the best analytical conditions. Ion trap mass spectrometer was used for LTB4 analysis. This study will be called methodological study throughout the text. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and ammonium hydroxide are mentioned as part of a study involving the measurement of LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Ammonium hydroxide is listed among the chemicals obtained for the study, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between LTB4 and ammonium hydroxide. Their mention is primarily related to the preparation and analysis of samples rather than any biochemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as LTB4 and ammonium hydroxide are simply listed among the chemicals used in the study without any indication of a direct or significant relationship between them.",
