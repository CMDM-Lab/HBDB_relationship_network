    "context": "To check for possible salivary contamination, \u03b1-amylase concentrations in all EBC samples were measured by in vitro colorimetric methods (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; \u03b1-Amylase-Liquid BIO-LA-TEST kit, Pliva-Lachema, Czech Republic). In the methodological study, LTB4 concentrations in EBC were expressed as pg/ml. In the observational study performed in children, LTB4 values in EBC were expressed as total amount (in pg) of leukotriene expired in the 15min breath test (LTB4 concentrations\u00d7volume of EBC). Concentration of LTB4 in undetectable samples was arbitrarily considered 25pg/ml that corresponds to 50% of the lower limit of quantification (50pg/ml).Sample pre-treatment In the methodological study, 1ml of EBC samples was spiked with 1.5ng/ml LTB4-d4 and concentrated 40-fold under a gentle nitrogen stream without any pre-treatment. Then, 20\u03bcl of the concentrate solution were directly injected into the sample loop. In the second study, 10\u03bcl of EBC sample were directly injected into the liquid chromatograph with no pre-treatment. In the study aimed at measuring 8-isoprostane in EBC with LC/ESI-MS/MS, EBC samples were pretreated with 50\u03bcl of immunoaffinity sorbent for 60min.Analytical conditions 2.6.1 Methodological study The stable isotope dilution method with LTB4-d4 as internal standard was used.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, with nitrogen mentioned as part of the sample concentration process. Specifically, LTB4 concentrations are concentrated under a gentle nitrogen stream, indicating that nitrogen is used as a carrier gas during the analytical procedure. However, there is no direct biological or chemical relationship established between LTB4 and nitrogen beyond this methodological aspect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as LTB4 is analyzed in a process that utilizes nitrogen, but there is no significant discussion of their functional or biological relationship.",
