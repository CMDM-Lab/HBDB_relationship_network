    "context": "LTB4 and LTB4-d4 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals Co (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use. Chemical purity of LTB4-d4 was \u226597% and the deuterium incorporation was \u22651%. The working solutions were prepared daily using mobile phase as solvent. In the study aiming at measuring 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-isoprostane or 15-F2t-isoprostane), [3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032, 2H4] 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 and 8-isoprostane affinity sorbent were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; triethylamine (99.5%) and ammonium hydroxide (28% NH3 solution in water) were obtained from Aldrich, USA; acetonitrile, water, methanol (LC/MS grade), acetic acid (99.9%) and formic acid (98\u2013100%) were obtained from Riedel de Haen, Germany.Study design Two studies were performed for identifying and quantifying LTB4 in EBC. In the first study, the primary objective was to ascertain whether LC/MS and/or LC/MS/MS analysis could be used to measure LTB4 in EBC and to establish the best analytical conditions. Ion trap mass spectrometer was used for LTB4 analysis. This study will be called methodological study throughout the text. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and acetonitrile are both mentioned as part of the materials used in a study involving the measurement of LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between LTB4 and acetonitrile. Acetonitrile is listed as a solvent used in the analytical methods, while LTB4 is the target analyte of the study. Their connection is purely incidental, related to the experimental setup rather than any chemical or biological interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as LTB4 and acetonitrile are mentioned in the same context but do not interact or relate functionally. Acetonitrile serves merely as a solvent in the analysis of LTB4, with no further discussion of their relationship.",
