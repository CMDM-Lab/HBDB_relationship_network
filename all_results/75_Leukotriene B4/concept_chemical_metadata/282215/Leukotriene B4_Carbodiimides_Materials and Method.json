    "context": "[2] In indicated experiments, vehicle, LPS, or rMCP-1 in vitro-stimulated macrophages (6 h) were restimulated with A23187 (0.5 \u00ce\u00bcM) for 15 min. [3] Stimulatory reaction was stopped on ice, and the samples were centrifuged at 500 \u00c3\u2014 g for 10 min at 4\u00c2\u00b0C. [4] The levels of LTB4 in cell supernatants were assayed by an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instructions (Cayman Chemical). [1] To immunodetection of newly formed LTB4 at its subcellular sites of synthesis within in vivo LPS-stimulated or in vitro MCP-1-stimulated macrophages, the cell preparations were mixed with 500 \u00ce\u00bcl of water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC in HBSS; 0.5% final concentration with cells; Sigma-Aldrich), used to cross-link eicosanoid carboxyl groups to amines in adjacent proteins. [2] After 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 min incubation at 37\u00c2\u00b0C with EDAC to promote both cell fixation and permeabilization, peritoneal macrophages were then washed with HBSS, cytospun onto glass slides, and blocked with HBSS containing 2% normal donkey serum for 10 min. [3] The cells were then sequentially incubated with a rabbit anti-LTB4 antiserum (Cayman Chemical) for 45 min. [4] Then, a guinea pig anti-ADRP polyclonal Ab (Research Diagnostics) or Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes) was added for 45 min to distinguish cytoplasmic lipid bodies within leukocytes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to the use of carbodiimides, specifically 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC), which is employed to cross-link eicosanoid carboxyl groups to amines in adjacent proteins. This method is used to facilitate the immunodetection of LTB4 in macrophages, indicating a direct experimental relationship where carbodiimides are utilized to enhance the study of LTB4's synthesis and localization within cells. Thus, carbodiimides play a crucial role in the experimental setup for studying LTB4.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTB4 and carbodiimides, as the latter is directly used in the experimental process to study the former. The context provides clear evidence of their interaction in the methodology, indicating a strong relevance.",
