    "context": "[2] In indicated experiments, vehicle, LPS, or rMCP-1 in vitro-stimulated macrophages (6 h) were restimulated with A23187 (0.5 \u00ce\u00bcM) for 15 min. [3] Stimulatory reaction was stopped on ice, and the samples were centrifuged at 500 \u00c3\u2014 g for 10 min at 4\u00c2\u00b0C. [4] The levels of LTB4 in cell supernatants were assayed by an enzyme immunoassay kit according to the manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instructions (Cayman Chemical). [1] To immunodetection of newly formed LTB4 at its subcellular sites of synthesis within in vivo LPS-stimulated or in vitro MCP-1-stimulated macrophages, the cell preparations were mixed with 500 \u00ce\u00bcl of water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC in HBSS; 0.5% final concentration with cells; Sigma-Aldrich), used to cross-link eicosanoid carboxyl groups to amines in adjacent proteins. [2] After 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 min incubation at 37\u00c2\u00b0C with EDAC to promote both cell fixation and permeabilization, peritoneal macrophages were then washed with HBSS, cytospun onto glass slides, and blocked with HBSS containing 2% normal donkey serum for 10 min. [3] The cells were then sequentially incubated with a rabbit anti-LTB4 antiserum (Cayman Chemical) for 45 min. [4] Then, a guinea pig anti-ADRP polyclonal Ab (Research Diagnostics) or Bodipy 493/503 (Molecular Probes) was added for 45 min to distinguish cytoplasmic lipid bodies within leukocytes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to its synthesis and detection in macrophages, where amines play a role in the cross-linking process of eicosanoid carboxyl groups to proteins. The use of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) facilitates this interaction, indicating a biochemical relationship where amines are involved in the stabilization or modification of LTB4 during experimental procedures. However, the context does not elaborate on the broader implications of this relationship beyond the experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTB4 and amines are connected through the biochemical process of cross-linking in the experimental context, indicating some interaction, but lacking detailed exploration of their functional relationship.",
