    "context": "Different publications showed a significant increase of LTB4 concentrations especially in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These data promote LTB4 to be a suitable parameter in the diagnostic field of e.g. pulmonary diseases especially considering the non-invasive character of sampling: LTB4 is usually detected from concentrated EBC via commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems. Those systems capture LTB4 as target molecule by anti-LTB4 antisera from rabbit or chicken and are used nowadays in commercially available immunoassay test kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA). In spite of many disadvantages (e.g. differing affinities or specifications, mixed isotypes, unlasting amount of serum from one batch) EIA systems are still performed with polyclonal sera but not monoclonal antibodies. A first monoclonal antibody (IgG2b) against LTB4 was already described in 1984 and used for analytical purposes [15\u201317] but not for diagnostic. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases such as asthma and COPD, with its concentrations measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The relationship to 'chemicals' arises from the mention of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems that utilize chemicals, specifically anti-LTB4 antisera, for the detection of LTB4. However, the connection is primarily focused on the diagnostic application rather than a direct chemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTB4 is analyzed using chemical methods (EIA systems) for diagnostic purposes, indicating a relationship between the biomarker and the chemicals used in its detection, but lacking deeper exploration of their interaction.",
        "score": 3
