    "context": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent pediatric disorder, affecting 4% to 11% of children all over the world. The etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to SDB in children have not been clearly elucidated, but may include a complex interplay between anatomic factors (mainly adenotonsillar hypertrophy), neuromuscular weakness and an underlying genetic predisposition toward the disease. Recently, evidence has emerged linking the presence of systemic inflammation to the pathophysiology of SDB [3\u20135]. Among the major inflammatory mediators, leukotrienes (LTs) are a family of inflammatory lipid mediators, which includes leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and LTC4/D4/E4 (cysteinyl leukotrienes, cysLTs). A number of previous works have shown that LT concentration emerged disease severity-dependent increases in both exhaled breath condensate and urine of SDB patients. And it is speculated that LTs may participate in the pathogenesis of SDB by recruiting inflammatory cells, promoting mucus production, producing smooth muscle contraction and inducing vascular damage. However, few studies have investigated how circulating level of LTs contributes to systemic inflammation of SDB. ",

        "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a member of the leukotriene family, which are inflammatory lipid mediators. The text discusses the role of leukotrienes, including LTB4, in the pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), highlighting their involvement in systemic inflammation and various inflammatory processes. This establishes a clear relationship between LTB4 and lipid mediators, as LTB4 is specifically categorized as one of these mediators that contribute to inflammation in SDB.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between leukotriene B4 and lipid mediators, as LTB4 is explicitly mentioned as an inflammatory lipid mediator involved in the pathogenesis of SDB. The context provides evidence of its role in inflammation, supporting a strong relationship.",
