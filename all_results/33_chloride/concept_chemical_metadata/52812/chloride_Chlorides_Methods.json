    "context": "The dilution factor for each sample was calculated using the total cation method: D C A T I O N S = [ N a + ] S E R U M + [ K + ] S E R U M [ N a + ] E B C + [ K + ] E B C 2.3.2 Nasal potential difference measurements Since previous research attempting to describe ion transport during exercise and following administration of pharmacological therapies in CF has primarily used measurement of NPD [28\u201332], NPD was also measured in this study to compare with EBC measurements. NPD was conducted according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network Standard Operating Procedure. The values to represent the changes in potential difference (PD) discussed in this paper were calculated as follows: Change with Amiloride ( \u0394 Amil ) = P D AMIL \u2212 P D RINGERS Change with C l - free + isoproterenol ( \u0394 Total Chloride Conductance ( \u0394 TCC ) ) = P D ISO \u2212 P D AMIL Change with ATP ( \u0394 ATP ) = P D ATP \u2212 P D ISO Note: the PD used in the above calculations was the steady state value measured over the last 10\u00a0s of the specified perfusion. In order to perform an NPD measurement twice within a treatment visit, we could not perform NPD tracings on both nostrils at the same time and compare changes in the average of both nostrils as has been recommended in order to get the most sensitivity for detecting changes in Cl\u2212 activity. Instead we compared the changes between the baseline NPD measurement taken on visit 1 and treatment visits (right nostril at baseline compared to right nostril on albuterol and submaximal exercise and same with the left nostril). The calculation of the difference between resting and treatment responses used was :\u00a0Treatment values \u2013Baseline (Visit 1) values for same nostril for \u0394Amil, \u0394TCC and \u0394ATP. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'chloride' and 'chlorides' refer to the same ion, Cl-, which is involved in the measurement of nasal potential difference (NPD) in cystic fibrosis research. The study discusses changes in chloride conductance during various treatments, indicating that both terms are used interchangeably to describe the same physiological component relevant to ion transport and respiratory function in cystic fibrosis patients.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between chloride and chlorides, as they are essentially the same entity in the context of ion transport measurements in cystic fibrosis, with significant implications for understanding respiratory physiology.",
        "score": 5
