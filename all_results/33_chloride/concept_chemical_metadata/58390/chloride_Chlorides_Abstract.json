    "context": "[5] We assessed possible contributions of changes in expression of the potassium\u00e2\u20ac\u201cchloride cotransporter KCC2. [6] Double in situ hybridization showed that mRNA for KCC2 was absent from \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc30% of CaMKII\u00ce\u00b1 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II\u00ce\u00b1)-positive subicular pyramidal cells. [7] Combining intracellular recordings with biocytin-filled electrodes and KCC2 immunochemistry, we observed that all cells that were hyperpolarized during interictal events were immunopositive for KCC2, whereas the majority of depolarized cells were immunonegative. [8] Bumetanide, at doses that selectively block the chloride-importing potassium\u00e2\u20ac\u201csodium\u00e2\u20ac\u201cchloride cotransporter NKCC1, produced a hyperpolarizing shift in GABAA reversal potentials and suppressed interictal activity. [9] Changes in Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 transporter expression thus contribute to human epileptiform activity, and molecules acting on these transporters may be useful antiepileptic drugs. [1] The epilepsies have often been linked to deficits in GABAergic signaling. [2] Synaptic currents induced when GABA binds to GABAA receptors are carried by chloride (Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) and, to a lesser degree, by bicarbonate (HCO3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride (Cl-) and chlorides are discussed in relation to their role in GABAergic signaling and the function of chloride transporters like KCC2 and NKCC1. The study highlights how changes in chloride transporter expression can influence neuronal excitability and contribute to epileptiform activity, suggesting that both terms are integral to understanding the mechanisms of epilepsy and potential therapeutic targets.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chloride and chlorides, as both terms are directly related to the function of chloride transporters in neuronal activity and their implications in epilepsy. The context provides evidence of their roles in GABA signaling and potential therapeutic applications.",
