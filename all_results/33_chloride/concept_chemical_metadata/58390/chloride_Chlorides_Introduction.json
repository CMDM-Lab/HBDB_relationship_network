    "context": "[2] Synaptic currents induced when GABA binds to GABAA receptors are carried by chloride (Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) and, to a lesser degree, by bicarbonate (HCO3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019). [3] GABAA receptor-mediated conductances either hyperpolarize or depolarize a neuron depending on its internal Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 and HCO3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 concentrations and membrane potential. [4] Pathological changes in Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 homeostasis can switch GABAergic signaling from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing in epileptic tissue (; ; ), but the basis of this change is unclear. [5] Two cation-chloride cotransporters may be especially important in controlling neuronal Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 (; ): the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 loads neurons with Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 and favors depolarizing responses to GABA, whereas the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 normally extrudes Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019, promoting hyperpolarizing responses. [1] Expression and function of both transporters are controlled at multiple levels. [2] During development, KCC2 expression is upregulated and NKCC1 is downregulated (; ; ; ). [3] These changes coincide with a hyperpolarizing shift in the reversal potential of cortical pyramidal cell GABAergic responses (; ; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride (Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) and chlorides are discussed in relation to GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Chloride ions are essential for the function of these receptors, influencing neuronal excitability by either hyperpolarizing or depolarizing neurons based on their concentrations. The text highlights the importance of chloride homeostasis and transporters in regulating GABAergic signaling, indicating a direct and critical relationship between chloride and chlorides in neuronal function.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as chloride is directly involved in the function of GABAA receptors, and the term 'chlorides' refers to the same ion in various forms. Their relationship is fundamental to understanding synaptic signaling and neuronal excitability.",
