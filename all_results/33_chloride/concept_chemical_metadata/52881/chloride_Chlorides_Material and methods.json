    "context": "Trajectories were generated for a 120-h hind-cast at elevations of 1000m, 500m, and 10m to represent the air masses at various elevations that may contribute to wet deposition (Draxler and Rolph, 2013). Trajectories were classified as mixed, marine or terrestrial as previously described (Avery et al., 2006a, 2013; Mullaugh et al., 2014).Supporting chemical analysis (DOC, Cl\u2212 and Na+) Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were measured by high temperature combustion using a Shimadzu TOC 5000 total organic carbon analyzer. Sodium (Na+) was performed with a PerkinElmer Model Optima 2100 DV Optical Emission Spectrometer using a wavelength of 589.592nm. Chloride (Cl\u2212) was measured with suppressed ion chromatography using a Dionex IC system outfitted with an IonPac\u00ae AS14A column and ASRS 300 4-mm suppressor. Details on supporting chemical analyses are described elsewhere (Mullaugh et al., 2013). All 111 rain samples were analyzed for benzene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers and carbon tetrachloride (Table 2 ). The total rain volume collected (171.9cm) was close to the annual average (1999\u20132009) of 156.1cm recorded at the Wilmington, NC International Airport (NOAA, 2010). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride (Cl\u2212) and chlorides are discussed in relation to their measurement in rainwater samples. Chloride is specifically analyzed as part of the chemical composition of the rain, indicating its presence as an ion in the samples. The terms are used interchangeably, with chloride referring to the anion and chlorides generally encompassing all forms of chloride compounds present in the samples. However, there is no detailed exploration of their distinct roles or interactions beyond their measurement.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as chloride and chlorides are mentioned in the context of chemical analysis of rain samples, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds but lacking a detailed discussion of their specific relationship or functional significance.",
