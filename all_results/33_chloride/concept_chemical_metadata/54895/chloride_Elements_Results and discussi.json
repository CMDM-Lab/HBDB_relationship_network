    "context": "Al and Na content were 10\u201315mg/g; Ca, Fe, and K content were several mg/g, and Mg and Mn were 0.6\u20130.8 and 0.1\u20130.4mg/g, respectively. Al, Na, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, and Mn content decreased with the increase of ZnCl2 concentration, but the increase of temperature did not significantly affect the content of these elements in pyrolytic residues. Generally, zinc chloride is capable of breaking up the coal structure, which could enhance the potential for a reaction where zinc switches between its elemental and oxidized forms. Therefore, some element contents could decrease with the increase of ZnCl2 immersed concentration. Concentrations of the toxic elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and V, ranged from 0.0141 to 0.0556, 0.0099 to 0.0343, 0.1438 to 0.2180, 0.0546 to 0.0853, 0.0261 to 0.0643, 0.0119 to 0.0243 and 0.0012 to 0.0017mg/g, respectively. Cadmium concentration decreased with the increase of the pyrolytic temperature of ZnCl2 immersed sludge. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride is mentioned as part of a broader discussion on the content of various elements in pyrolytic residues affected by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) concentration. While chloride itself is not explicitly detailed, it is implied as one of the elements being analyzed alongside others like Al, Na, Ca, and toxic elements. The relationship is indirect, as chloride is part of the elemental composition being studied, but no specific interactions or significance are provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as chloride is included in the list of elements analyzed in the context of their concentrations affected by ZnCl2. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or relationship with the other elements.",
