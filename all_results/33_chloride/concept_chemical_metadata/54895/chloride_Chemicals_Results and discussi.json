    "context": "But the micropore volume did not increase with the increase of ZnCl2 immersed concentration. The overloading of ZnCl2 immersed sludge could inhibit the development of micropores; the 1M ZnCl2 immersed sludge had the highest micropore volume at different pyrolytic temperatures. This was due to the fact that the high ZnCl2 concentration could create larger pores and destroy the pore structure to enlarge the pores; therefore, low or high ZnCl2 immersed sludge had a lower fraction of micropore volume. In this work, the chemical activation of zinc chloride in the biosludge is believed to involve chemical attack of the cell structure of the biosludge. The composition of the biosludge and the concentration of the activating agent would influence the final product adsorbent. ZnCl2 dehydrates the biosludge during the chemical treatment stage and inhibits the formation of tar and volatiles, thereby increasing the char yield during pyrolysis. A low zinc chloride dose with high pyrolysis temperature promoted the development of specific surface area, while very high temperatures could destroy the pore structure and reduce the specific surface area.

        "summary": "In this context, chloride, specifically in the form of zinc chloride (ZnCl2), is discussed as a chemical agent used in the activation of biosludge during pyrolysis. The relationship highlights how the concentration of ZnCl2 affects the micropore volume and overall structure of the biosludge, indicating that chloride, as part of a chemical compound, plays a significant role in the chemical treatment process. However, the term 'chemicals' is used broadly to refer to various substances involved in the process without a specific focus on chloride beyond its role in ZnCl2.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as chloride is specifically mentioned in the context of its chemical form (ZnCl2) and its effects on biosludge, indicating a clear interaction. However, the broader term 'chemicals' lacks specificity in relation to chloride, limiting the depth of their connection.",
