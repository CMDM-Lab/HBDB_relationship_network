    "context": "Al and Na content were 10\u201315mg/g; Ca, Fe, and K content were several mg/g, and Mg and Mn were 0.6\u20130.8 and 0.1\u20130.4mg/g, respectively. Al, Na, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, and Mn content decreased with the increase of ZnCl2 concentration, but the increase of temperature did not significantly affect the content of these elements in pyrolytic residues. Generally, zinc chloride is capable of breaking up the coal structure, which could enhance the potential for a reaction where zinc switches between its elemental and oxidized forms. Therefore, some element contents could decrease with the increase of ZnCl2 immersed concentration. Concentrations of the toxic elements As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and V, ranged from 0.0141 to 0.0556, 0.0099 to 0.0343, 0.1438 to 0.2180, 0.0546 to 0.0853, 0.0261 to 0.0643, 0.0119 to 0.0243 and 0.0012 to 0.0017mg/g, respectively. Cadmium concentration decreased with the increase of the pyrolytic temperature of ZnCl2 immersed sludge. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride is mentioned in relation to the effects of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) on the composition of coal during pyrolysis. The presence of ZnCl2 is noted to influence the breakdown of coal structure and the subsequent release or alteration of various elemental contents, including chloride. However, the specific role of chloride itself in the coal reaction process is not elaborated upon, indicating a more indirect relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between chloride and coal, as chloride is part of the discussion on elemental content affected by zinc chloride treatment of coal, but there is no detailed exploration of their direct interaction.",
