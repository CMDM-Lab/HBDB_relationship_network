    "context": "Polymerization was performed under stirring at 80\u00b0C for about 15h. The compositions of co-monomers are shown in Table 1 . The prepared polymer beads were collected, washed with distilled water and acetone, and then dried. The polymer beads were pre-swollen in methylene chloride and extracted with the same solvent in Soxhlet apparatus for 15h, then washed successively with pure solvent and solvent mixtures with gradually increasing solubility parameters, i.e., acetone, acetone/methanol, methanol, methanol/water, and finally distilled water. Afterwards, the beads were dried in air for 24h, and then in oven at 60\u00b0C. Polymer beads with diameters in the range of 0.3\u20131.0mm were selected for further studies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride and distilled water are mentioned in the process of washing and extracting polymer beads. Distilled water is used as a solvent in the washing process, which may help remove impurities, including chloride ions, from the polymer beads. However, there is no direct discussion of the chemical interaction or specific relevance of chloride in relation to distilled water beyond its incidental mention in the washing procedure.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as chloride is mentioned in the context of washing with distilled water, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions.",
