    "context": "To collect EBC while subjects were cycling, plastic tubing was used to connect the inlet port of the EcoScreen to the exhalation port of a Y-valve connected to the backside of the switching valve with the pneumotach attached to on the front side (setup pictured in supplemental material Fig.\u00a08 A and B). Quantification of chloride was completed using ion chromatography and sodium and potassium were measured with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The calculation of net chloride efflux was used to account for the paracellular reabsorption of Cl\u2212 that will follow the reabsorption of Na+ to maintain electroneutral ion flux. Thus, the net chloride efflux calculation used was the gross chloride concentration plus the absolute value of the percent change in sodium from baseline multiplied by the gross chloride concentration for each time point: N e t C l \u2212 e f f l u x = C l X \u2212 M I N U T E S P O S T \u2212 + N a X \u2212 M I N U T E S P O S T + \u2212 N a B A S E L I N E + N a B A S E L I N E + \u00d7 C l X \u2212 M I N U T E S P O S T \u2212 Because the ratio of exhaled water to ASL droplets in the EBC sample is unpredictable and changing, we also applied a dilution factor to our EBC ion concentrations. The dilution factor for each sample was calculated using the total cation method: D C A T I O N S = [ N a + ] S E R U M + [ K + ] S E R U M [ N a + ] E B C + [ K + ] E B C 2.3.2 Nasal potential difference measurements Since previous research attempting to describe ion transport during exercise and following administration of pharmacological therapies in CF has primarily used measurement of NPD [28\u201332], NPD was also measured in this study to compare with EBC measurements. NPD was conducted according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Development Network Standard Operating Procedure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride is quantified in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected from subjects during cycling. The study details the methodology for measuring chloride levels, including the calculation of net chloride efflux, which accounts for ion transport dynamics during exhalation. This indicates a direct relationship between chloride levels and the process of exhalation, particularly in the context of respiratory physiology and ion transport mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chloride and exhalation, as the study provides detailed methods for measuring chloride in exhaled breath, indicating its relevance in respiratory function and ion transport. However, the relationship could be further explored in terms of physiological implications.",
