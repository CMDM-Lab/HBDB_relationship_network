    "context": "To study ion regulation, two measurement techniques were used; exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection, a novel measure of sodium and chloride content, and nasal potential difference (NPD) measurements, a standard measure of airway ion transport. We hypothesized that moderate intensity exercise would result in a decrease in EBC Na+ and sodium transport detected by NPD (\u0394Amil) from baseline due to purinergic-mediated ENaC inhibition. With albuterol administration, we predicted an increase or no change in EBC Na+ and \u0394Amil from baseline due to albuterol's adrenergic activation of ENaC. For chloride transport, we predicted an even greater increase in EBC Cl\u2212 and chloride transport detected by NPD (\u0394TCC and \u0394ATP) with exercise compared to albuterol due to activation of both CFTR and CaCC with exercise. A summary of the expected changes in ion channel regulation in response to albuterol and exercise is provided in Fig.\u00a01 . Subjects Fourteen individuals with CF with mild to moderate lung disease (FEV1 >50% predicted), clinically diagnosed with a positive sweat test (>60\u00a0mmol/L Cl\u2212), and who were carriers of at least one \u0394F508 allele were recruited for the present study. These subjects had not participated in another clinical trial within the past 30 days, or experienced a pulmonary exacerbation within two weeks. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride and chloride transport are directly related as the study investigates the regulation of chloride ions in the airway through various measurement techniques. The research hypothesizes that exercise will enhance chloride transport, as measured by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and nasal potential difference (NPD), indicating a significant role of chloride in respiratory ion transport mechanisms, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between chloride and chloride transport, as the study explicitly examines how exercise influences chloride transport mechanisms in the airway, highlighting their critical relationship in the context of cystic fibrosis.",
        "score": 5
