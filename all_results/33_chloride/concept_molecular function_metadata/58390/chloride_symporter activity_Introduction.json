    "context": "[2] Synaptic currents induced when GABA binds to GABAA receptors are carried by chloride (Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) and, to a lesser degree, by bicarbonate (HCO3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019). [3] GABAA receptor-mediated conductances either hyperpolarize or depolarize a neuron depending on its internal Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 and HCO3\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 concentrations and membrane potential. [4] Pathological changes in Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 homeostasis can switch GABAergic signaling from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing in epileptic tissue (; ; ), but the basis of this change is unclear. [5] Two cation-chloride cotransporters may be especially important in controlling neuronal Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 (; ): the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter NKCC1 loads neurons with Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 and favors depolarizing responses to GABA, whereas the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 normally extrudes Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019, promoting hyperpolarizing responses. [1] Expression and function of both transporters are controlled at multiple levels. [2] During development, KCC2 expression is upregulated and NKCC1 is downregulated (; ; ; ). [3] These changes coincide with a hyperpolarizing shift in the reversal potential of cortical pyramidal cell GABAergic responses (; ; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chloride (Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019) is crucial for GABAergic signaling, with its homeostasis influenced by symporter activity. The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) increases intracellular Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019, promoting depolarization, while the K-Cl cotransporter (KCC2) extrudes Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019, facilitating hyperpolarization. The balance of these transporters is essential for proper neuronal function and is regulated during development, affecting GABA responses in neurons.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chloride and symporter activity, as the context discusses how these transporters regulate Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 levels, impacting GABAergic signaling. The relationship is supported by evidence of their roles in neuronal excitability and development.",
