    "context": "Although only distinct cysteines are palmitoylated in integral membrane proteins, their position varies considerably in different acylated proteins. The only common characteristic of the palmitoylated cysteine residues is their location at the cytoplasmic side near transmembrane domains, or in the transmembrane domain itself. By computer-assisted alignment of known palmitoylated transmembrane proteins, Grosenbach et al. came up with the motif TMDX1\u201312AAC(C)A (in which TMD stands for transmembrane domain, X for amino acid and A for aliphatic amino acid) as conserved acceptor motif for palmitoylation of integral membrane proteins. Signals for the palmitoylation of proSP-C may be present within the mature SP-C amino acid sequence, as mature SP-C expressed in insect cells by the baculovirus system was palmitoylated for about 15% and the degree of incorporation of palmitate into mature SP-C expressed in CHO cells was at least equal to that incorporated into proSP-C expressed in these cells. For that reason, the requirements for palmitoylation of proSP-C have been extensively studied recently by performing site-directed mutagenesis on the amino acid sequence representing mature SP-C within the background of the proSP-C sequence. The two adjacent basic residues, lysine-34 and arginine-35 of proSP-C (residues 11 and 12, respectively, of the mature SP-C) do not constitute a signal for palmitoylation, but do influence palmitoylation of proSP-C indirectly by changing the subcellular localization of the protein, as a result of which it does not become palmitoylated (Figs. 2 and 3)  . Furthermore, the sequence of the transmembrane domain appears not to play a role in palmitoylation of SP-C, as the transmembrane domain of proSP-C could be substituted by an artificial transmembrane domain without affecting palmitoylation (Fig. 3 ; see proSP-C mutant LAAAL4).

        "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid is indirectly related to palmitoylation, as palmitoylation refers to the process of attaching palmitic acid (a fatty acid) to cysteine residues in proteins. The discussion focuses on the specific characteristics and requirements for palmitoylation in integral membrane proteins, particularly proSP-C, highlighting the role of palmitic acid in this post-translational modification. The study emphasizes the significance of palmitoylation in protein localization and function, indicating a clear biochemical relationship between palmitic acid and the palmitoylation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between palmitic acid and palmitoylation, as the context discusses the role of palmitic acid in the palmitoylation process, supported by specific examples and implications for protein function. The relationship is well-established within the biochemical framework.",
