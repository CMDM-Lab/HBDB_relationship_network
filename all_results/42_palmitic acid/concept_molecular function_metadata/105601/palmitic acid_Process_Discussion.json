    "context": "To estimate dilution factor of non-volatile constituents of EBC a current conducting ions, total protein, tyrosine or urea were proposed as other diffusible biomolecules. However, measurements of micromolar concentrations of these compounds cannot be done using routine clinical laboratory analyzers and require development of stand-alone methods. Moreover, to estimate dilution of EBC sample by measurement of electric conductance, volatile ions have to be removed by evaporation prior to the measurement and an extra sample volume is needed. In our opinion, recalculation of eicosanoids content on palmitic acid concentration in EBC has the advantage of simultaneous processing of the compounds and unbiased measurement using GC\u2013MS. It is probably a surrogate marker only for dilution of EBC with water, however recalculated results can improve statistics. For example, difference in 5-HETE concentration between non-smokers and smokers, significant also for raw data, was greater following recalculation on PA (chi square approximation changed from 4.81 to 6.95). Ascertainment of several eicosanoids in EBC, interlinked by common metabolic pathways, gave results consistent with their estimations in other biological fluids. ",

        "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid (PA) is discussed as a key component for recalculating eicosanoid concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. The process involves using PA concentration to improve the accuracy of statistical measurements related to the dilution of EBC, particularly in differentiating between smokers and non-smokers. This suggests that PA plays a significant role in the analytical process of measuring eicosanoids, which are linked by common metabolic pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between palmitic acid and the analytical process of measuring eicosanoids in EBC. The context provides evidence of how PA concentration enhances the accuracy of measurements, indicating a clear relationship within the biochemical analysis framework.",
