    "context": "However, EBC collection is biased by a variable dilution of the sample with condensed water vapor. A few methods to adjust the dilution factor of a sample, similarly to recalculation of urinary metabolites per creatinine content, have been proposed [13\u201316]. We used palmitic acid concentration, as a marker for dilution of EBC sample. Palmitic acid is the most abundant non-volatile lipid molecule in EBC, because phospholipid esters of palmitic acid comprise over 60% of the lung surfactant. Yet, using our analytical procedure these phospholipids were excluded from measurement because much more aggressive chemical conditions would be required to hydrolise esterified palmitic acid. The mean concentration of free palmitic acid in EBC was 560ng/mL and its standard deviation was moderate (187ng/mL). It did not depend on gender, age or tobacco smoking. ",

        "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid is highlighted as a significant non-volatile lipid molecule in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), with a notable presence in lung surfactant as phospholipid esters. These esters, which comprise over 60% of lung surfactant, indicate a direct relationship between palmitic acid and esters, as the latter are formed from the esterification of palmitic acid. However, the study notes that the analytical method used excludes these esterified forms from measurement, focusing instead on free palmitic acid concentrations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between palmitic acid and esters, as palmitic acid is a key component of phospholipid esters in lung surfactant. The context provides evidence of this relationship, although the exclusion of esterified forms from measurement slightly limits the depth of the connection.",
