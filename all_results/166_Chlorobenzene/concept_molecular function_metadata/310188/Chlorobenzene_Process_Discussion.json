    "context": "Unlike the graphite structure of coal, woodiness material in coconut shell, which is very difficult to form collapse structure during the solid phase carbonization process. Hence, the smaller graphitic crystallite size with less disordered structure contributes to a better adsorption performance (CDC). Due to the unstable structure, abundant of carbonyl groups formed in the oxidation pathway on CAC(Gong et\u00a0al., 1998). In addition, based on the fitting result from LDF and Y-N models, the diffusion resistance in CDC is significantly less than that of CAC.Comparison of adsorbates Aiming at comparing chlorobenzene and toluene adsorption process on CDC, the adsorption isotherm was compared and investigated. The relevant variables such as K H and q st are obtained by theory calculation and models fits, which reveal that the chlorobenzene adsorption on CDC is much easier than toluene adsorption. Because of Henry's law which CDC adsorption obeys at low pressure, the deviation of the T\u1f78th and Langmuir model occurs. In contrast, the D-A model, based on the potential theory, can well describe the adsorption equilibrium for different adsorbates. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is compared to toluene in terms of their adsorption processes on a carbonaceous material (CDC). The study highlights that chlorobenzene adsorption is more favorable than toluene, indicating a specific relationship between the chemical properties of chlorobenzene and the adsorption process. The analysis involves theoretical calculations and model fits to understand the adsorption behavior, suggesting a significant connection between chlorobenzene and the adsorption process being investigated.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and the adsorption process, supported by comparative analysis and theoretical modeling. The context provides evidence of chlorobenzene's easier adsorption compared to toluene, indicating a clear relationship within the study.",
