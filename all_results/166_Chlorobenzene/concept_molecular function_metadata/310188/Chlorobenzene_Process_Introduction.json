    "context": "Although pyrolysis of CB results mainly in chlorine abstraction, OH radical reaction with CB cannot lead only to OH addition, but also to hydrogen abstraction. This latter mechanism, favoured at higher temperatures, as occurring in ultrasound, results in chlorinated phenyl radicals. However, due to the low initial concentrations of CB and knowing that the yield of individual volatile intermediates is typically in the order of 1%, analytical methodology could be the major obstacle to prove OH radical induced degradation. Toluene and chlorobenzene are two typical aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are mainly emitted from chemical process industries, including painting, coating, rubber, and so on (Lillo-R\u00f3denas et\u00a0al., 2005). Aromatic VOCs are seriously toxic to human living conditions and healths, and even though at very low concentrations. They can lead to eye and throat irritation, damage to liver and central nervous system (Das et\u00a0al., 2004). In addition, as important contributors and precursor to air pollution, they can also contribute to the ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, which makes up photochemical smog (Guenther et\u00a0al., 1995; Riipinen et\u00a0al., 2012).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene (CB) is discussed in relation to its degradation processes, particularly through pyrolysis and reactions with hydroxyl (OH) radicals. The mention of CB as a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from chemical processes highlights its significance in industrial emissions and environmental health. The context emphasizes the need for analytical methodologies to study its degradation, indicating that chlorobenzene is closely tied to various chemical processes that impact air quality and human health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and chemical processes, as the context discusses its degradation mechanisms and its role as a VOC emitted from industrial activities. This relationship is supported by the implications for health and environmental impact.",
        "score": 4
