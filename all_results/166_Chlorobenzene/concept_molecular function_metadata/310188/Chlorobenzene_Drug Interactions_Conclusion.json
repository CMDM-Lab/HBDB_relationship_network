    "context": "There are two major reasons as follows: (1) Suitable pore size (size\u202f<\u202f0.8\u202fnm) leads to larger interaction on adsorbents for aromatic VOCs adsorption based on the micropore filling theory. However, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl found in CAC may reduce the surface electron density weakening the interactions between adsorbents and adsorbates. (2) According to the results of isotherms fits, it can be deduced that chlorobenzene adsorption on CDC exhibits greater affinity (Lennard\u2013Jones potential) than toluene. Furthermore, the more polarized electrons of chlorobenzene enhance the adsorbate\u2013adsorbent interaction, which makes chlorobenzene more easily adsorbed on the adsorbent. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major air pollutants in indoor environments, which significantly impact indoor quality, and thus are of growing concern to human health. Due to their common use in manufacturing processes, VOCs originate from a large variety of indoor sources including building materials, furnishings, cleaning supplies and pesticides and are frequently found indoors at levels exceeding those outdoors (EPA, 2007). At high levels of exposure, many VOCs are known to cause toxic effects, whereas low levels have been linked to airway inflammation and alterations in immune cell function, with a subsequent risk for development of allergies and asthma (Diez et al., 2000; Lehmann et al., 2001, 2002).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed primarily in relation to its adsorption properties as a volatile organic compound (VOC) and its interactions with adsorbents. While chlorobenzene is noted for its greater affinity for certain adsorbents compared to toluene, there is no direct mention of drug interactions or any specific relationship between chlorobenzene and drug interactions. The focus remains on its environmental impact and health concerns related to VOC exposure rather than pharmacological interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant discussion connecting chlorobenzene to drug interactions. They are mentioned in the same context, but there is no evidence or indication of a relationship between them.",
