    "context": "According to the results of deconvolution, the proportion of C=O in CAC (14.8%) is obviously larger than that in CDC (13.8%). Therefore, both the XPS and FTIR results imply that the electron-withdrawing carbonyl found in CAC may reduce its surface electron density, weakening the \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugated effect between VOC and CAC.Theoretical calculation and model fit Based on the constructing CDC model from a random packing with BSUs in Packmol procedure as shown in Fig.\u00a04 (a), isosteric heats (figure S2) and adsorption isotherms (Fig.\u00a04(b)) were obtained by the GCMC simulation using the sorption module of Material Studio. Isosteric heat (q st) of adsorption is an important physiochemical parameter to explore the intermolecular forces between adsorbent and adsorbate (Madani et\u00a0al., 2016). As shown in Fig.\u00a0S2, the q st of chlorobenzene is generally higher than that of toluene, which signifies a stronger binding force of chlorobenzene on CDC. As seen in Fig.\u00a04(b), the adsorption isotherms were fitted by Langmuir, T\u1f78th, and Dubinin\u2013Astakhov (D\u2013A) isotherm models (Mertens, 2009; Purewal et\u00a0al., 2012). The results show that the D-A model, based on the potential theory, can well describe the adsorption equilibrium at different temperatures than another two models. As for Langmuir equation, it is assumed to be homogeneous on the surface of adsorbent, and no interactions between adsorbed molecules. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption characteristics, specifically highlighting its stronger binding force compared to toluene on CDC. The isosteric heat of adsorption (q st) is mentioned as a key parameter to explore intermolecular forces, indicating that chlorobenzene exhibits a higher q st, which signifies a greater force of interaction with the adsorbent material. This suggests a significant relationship between chlorobenzene and the concept of force in terms of adsorption strength.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and force, as the context provides quantitative data on the binding strength of chlorobenzene compared to toluene, indicating a clear relationship in the context of adsorption forces.",
        "score": 4
