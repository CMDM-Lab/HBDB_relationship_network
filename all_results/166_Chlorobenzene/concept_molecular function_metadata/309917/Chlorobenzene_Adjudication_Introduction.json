    "context": "In addition, there is evidence from an epidemiological study that exposure to chlorobenzene at concentration levels below 10\u03bcg/m3 can be associated with allergic sensitizations as well as a Th2 primed T cell immunity in children (Lehmann et al., 2001). However, the mechanism of allergy mediating effects of chlorobenzene and other VOC is still unknown. To investigate the inflammatory and immuno-modulatory potential of chlorobenzene, we exposed human lung epithelial cells (cell line A549) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the air/liquid cell culture system. In addition to cytotoxic effects, we analyzed the influence of chlorobenzene on the functional activity of human lung epithelial and peripheral blood cells by determination of released mediators. IL-8 and MCP-1 were selected as relevant functional parameters of the lung epithelial cell line A549, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 as inflammatory markers produced by PBMC. In addition, PBMC-derived release of IFN-\u03b3 (as marker for Th1 cells) and IL-13 (as marker for Th2 cells) was considered. Materials and methods Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7] in a purity \u2a7e99% (GC) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its potential immuno-modulatory effects and allergic sensitization, particularly in children. However, the term 'adjudication' is not directly addressed or linked to chlorobenzene's effects or the study's findings. The relationship between the two terms is not established, as adjudication typically refers to a legal process rather than a biological or chemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between chlorobenzene and adjudication in the context provided. They are mentioned in the same text, but there is no discussion or connection between them.",
