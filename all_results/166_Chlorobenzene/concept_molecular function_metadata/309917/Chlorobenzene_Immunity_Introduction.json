    "context": "A Russian study reported on higher incidences of immunological dysfunctions, disturbed phagocytic activity of the leucocytes, dermal infections, dermatitis, and chronic effects to the respiratory organs of woman who were occupationally exposed. Inhalation of chlorobenzene may be toxic to the lung. Apart from necrotic lesions in the bronchial epithelium, irritations to the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have been observed after inhalation of chlorobenzene vapor (NIOH/NIOSH, 1994). In addition, there is evidence from an epidemiological study that exposure to chlorobenzene at concentration levels below 10\u03bcg/m3 can be associated with allergic sensitizations as well as a Th2 primed T cell immunity in children (Lehmann et al., 2001). However, the mechanism of allergy mediating effects of chlorobenzene and other VOC is still unknown. To investigate the inflammatory and immuno-modulatory potential of chlorobenzene, we exposed human lung epithelial cells (cell line A549) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the air/liquid cell culture system. In addition to cytotoxic effects, we analyzed the influence of chlorobenzene on the functional activity of human lung epithelial and peripheral blood cells by determination of released mediators. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to immunological dysfunctions, including disturbed phagocytic activity and allergic sensitizations, particularly in children. The study highlights the potential immuno-modulatory effects of chlorobenzene exposure, suggesting that it may influence T cell immunity and provoke inflammatory responses in lung epithelial and blood cells. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and immunity, supported by evidence of immunological dysfunctions and allergic sensitizations associated with exposure. The context discusses both cytotoxic effects and functional activity alterations in immune cells, indicating a strong relevance.",
