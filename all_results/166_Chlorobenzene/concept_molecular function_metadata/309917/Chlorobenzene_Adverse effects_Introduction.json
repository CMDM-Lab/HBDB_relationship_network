    "context": "Like other volatile halogenated hydrocarbons, chlorobenzene is also present in the indoor air of, for example, household settings in amounts exceeding those of the ambient air. Indoor air concentrations in a German city, Leipzig, were found between 1 and 3.5\u03bcg/m3 (Herbarth and Rehwagen, 1998). Somewhat higher indoor air concentrations were found in various cities in the USA (up to 72.2\u03bcg/m3) (BUA, 1991). Exposure to chlorobenzene has been shown to be related with several adverse health effects. Inhalation of high doses of chlorobenzene led to drowsiness, lack of coordination, and unconsciousness (resulting from CNS-depression) as well as irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract (Deichmann, 1981; EPA, 1988; Von Burg, 1981; Willhite and Book, 1990). A Russian study reported on higher incidences of immunological dysfunctions, disturbed phagocytic activity of the leucocytes, dermal infections, dermatitis, and chronic effects to the respiratory organs of woman who were occupationally exposed. Inhalation of chlorobenzene may be toxic to the lung. ",

        "summary": "Chlorobenzene is identified as a volatile halogenated hydrocarbon that can accumulate in indoor air, leading to various adverse health effects upon exposure. The context details specific health issues associated with inhalation, including central nervous system depression, respiratory irritation, and immunological dysfunctions. This establishes a clear and significant relationship between chlorobenzene exposure and its adverse effects on health.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between chlorobenzene and its adverse health effects, supported by specific examples of health issues caused by exposure. The context provides substantial evidence of the negative impact of chlorobenzene on human health.",
        "score": 5
