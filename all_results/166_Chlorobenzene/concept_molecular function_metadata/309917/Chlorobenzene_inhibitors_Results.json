    "context": "Results To allow a direct chlorobenzene exposure via the gas phase cells were cultivated on microporous membranes and were exposed apically directly without medium coverage. For nutrition, cells were provided with medium from the lower site through the membrane of the culture insert (Fig. 1 ). Methanol used as a chlorobenzene diluent had no significant effect on the vitality of PBMC or A549 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the vitalities of PBMC and A549 cells were not affected by chlorobenzene, neither in a stimulating nor in an inhibitory manner, although a very broad concentration range covering concentrations between 0.1\u03bcg/m3 and 100g/m3 was tested (data not shown). While the solvent methanol did not influence the MCP-1 production in A549 cells, the IL-8 release of these cells was significantly inhibited (Table 1 ). In PBMC, methanol had no significant effects on IL-13, IFN-\u03b3, and MCP-1 release. Only the TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly reduced by methanol (Table 2 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is evaluated for its effects on cell vitality and cytokine production in PBMC and A549 cells. The results indicate that chlorobenzene does not exhibit significant stimulating or inhibitory effects on cell vitality. However, methanol, used as a diluent for chlorobenzene, significantly inhibited IL-8 release in A549 cells and reduced TNF-\u03b1 production in PBMC. While chlorobenzene itself is not directly linked to inhibition, the context suggests that the presence of inhibitors (like methanol) can affect cytokine production in the studied cells.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as chlorobenzene is mentioned in relation to the effects of methanol, which acts as an inhibitor of certain cytokine productions. However, chlorobenzene's own role as an inhibitor is not established.",
