    "context": "Inhalation of chlorobenzene may be toxic to the lung. Apart from necrotic lesions in the bronchial epithelium, irritations to the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have been observed after inhalation of chlorobenzene vapor (NIOH/NIOSH, 1994). In addition, there is evidence from an epidemiological study that exposure to chlorobenzene at concentration levels below 10\u03bcg/m3 can be associated with allergic sensitizations as well as a Th2 primed T cell immunity in children (Lehmann et al., 2001). However, the mechanism of allergy mediating effects of chlorobenzene and other VOC is still unknown. To investigate the inflammatory and immuno-modulatory potential of chlorobenzene, we exposed human lung epithelial cells (cell line A549) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the air/liquid cell culture system. In addition to cytotoxic effects, we analyzed the influence of chlorobenzene on the functional activity of human lung epithelial and peripheral blood cells by determination of released mediators. IL-8 and MCP-1 were selected as relevant functional parameters of the lung epithelial cell line A549, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 as inflammatory markers produced by PBMC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to hypersensitivity through its potential to cause allergic sensitizations and Th2 primed T cell immunity in children, as indicated by an epidemiological study. The inhalation of chlorobenzene is associated with respiratory irritations and cytotoxic effects on lung epithelial cells, suggesting a role in immune modulation and hypersensitivity reactions. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear, warranting further investigation into its inflammatory effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and hypersensitivity, supported by epidemiological evidence of allergic sensitization and immune response alterations. The context discusses both the toxic effects and the potential immunological implications, indicating a strong relevance.",
        "score": 4
