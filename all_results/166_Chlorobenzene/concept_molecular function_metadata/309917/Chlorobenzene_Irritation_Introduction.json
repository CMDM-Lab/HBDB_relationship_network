    "context": "Inhalation of high doses of chlorobenzene led to drowsiness, lack of coordination, and unconsciousness (resulting from CNS-depression) as well as irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract (Deichmann, 1981; EPA, 1988; Von Burg, 1981; Willhite and Book, 1990). A Russian study reported on higher incidences of immunological dysfunctions, disturbed phagocytic activity of the leucocytes, dermal infections, dermatitis, and chronic effects to the respiratory organs of woman who were occupationally exposed. Inhalation of chlorobenzene may be toxic to the lung. Apart from necrotic lesions in the bronchial epithelium, irritations to the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have been observed after inhalation of chlorobenzene vapor (NIOH/NIOSH, 1994). In addition, there is evidence from an epidemiological study that exposure to chlorobenzene at concentration levels below 10\u03bcg/m3 can be associated with allergic sensitizations as well as a Th2 primed T cell immunity in children (Lehmann et al., 2001). However, the mechanism of allergy mediating effects of chlorobenzene and other VOC is still unknown. To investigate the inflammatory and immuno-modulatory potential of chlorobenzene, we exposed human lung epithelial cells (cell line A549) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the air/liquid cell culture system.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to irritation as it causes significant adverse effects upon inhalation, including irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract. The text discusses various health impacts of chlorobenzene exposure, highlighting its role in causing mucous membrane irritation and potential long-term respiratory issues. The evidence suggests a direct relationship between chlorobenzene exposure and irritation symptoms, particularly in occupational settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chlorobenzene and irritation, supported by multiple studies indicating that inhalation leads to significant irritation of the respiratory tract and mucous membranes. The context provides substantial evidence of chlorobenzene's irritative effects, although it does not delve into the underlying mechanisms.",
        "score": 4
