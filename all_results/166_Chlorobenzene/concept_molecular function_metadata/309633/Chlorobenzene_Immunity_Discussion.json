    "context": "This is in accordance to results from previous studies that MCP-1, a pro-inflammatory mediator triggering immune response toward a Th2 phenotype, is increased in response to styrene or chlorobenzene (Lehmann et al., 2008). Suggesting that aromatic VOCs induce a Th2 phenotype in the lung Th2 cells produce the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13, which are known to stimulate the development of IgE-mediated allergic responses. In fact, we were able to show in an earlier study, that culture supernatants of chlorobenzene exposed lung epithelial cells induce an IL-13 release in primary T cells (Lehmann et al., 2008). Furthermore, there is evidence from an epidemiological study that exposure to chlorobenzene in the household can be associated with allergic sensitization and Th2 primed T-cell immunity in children (Lehmann et al., 2001). This VOC-mediated lung inflammation and Th2 shift could be the basis for the development of an allergic reaction. More recently published reports from in vivo studies discuss the role of PGE2 in lung inflammation controversially. It is suggested that PGE2 may also play a role in inhibiting the inflammatory response (Gauvreau et al., 1999; Martin et al., 2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to immune responses, particularly through its role in promoting a Th2 phenotype in lung cells. Exposure to chlorobenzene increases MCP-1 levels, which triggers Th2 immune responses characterized by the production of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. These cytokines are associated with IgE-mediated allergic reactions, indicating that chlorobenzene exposure may contribute to allergic sensitization and altered immune function, particularly in children.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between chlorobenzene and immunity, as the context provides substantial evidence of chlorobenzene's role in inducing Th2 immune responses and its association with allergic sensitization, highlighting a critical relationship in immunological outcomes.",
