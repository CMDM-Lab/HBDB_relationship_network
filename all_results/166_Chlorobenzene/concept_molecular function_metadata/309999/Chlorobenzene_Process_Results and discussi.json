    "context": "If we compare the calibration curves between compounds of different groups, the analyte selectivity of the fiber still can be explained, except for 1,1-DCE and CT, by K H. For the low sensitivity compounds (MCB, 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, CT, CF and DCM) this relation is valid from a minimum amount of carbon in the aqueous standard of approximately 100nmol. In this case, the relation with the other factors is not clear. However, the compounds which showed the calibration curves with highest linearity (PCE, TCE, toluene and MCB) are the compounds with lowest P 0. To test if the competition process produces an isotopic effect on C isotopes, aqueous standard solutions of selected compounds at different concentration were prepared with the standard stock solutions P10 and P10-C (Fig. 3). When an analyte has the same concentration in two aqueous standard solutions, one prepared with the stock solution P10 and the other with P10-C, the total concentration of VOCs in each standard will be different. The calibration curves of PCE and TCE (Fig. 4 ) did not show significant differences, despite the reduction of their molar fraction and the increase of VOCs concentration, in 147.0%, in the standards P10-C compared to P10. This fact indicates that these compounds have a high affinity to the fiber. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned alongside various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in relation to calibration curves and analyte selectivity during a testing process. However, there is no specific discussion about chlorobenzene's role or interaction within the described process, making its relevance to the overall methodology unclear. The focus is more on the calibration and competition processes involving multiple compounds rather than a direct relationship with chlorobenzene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as chlorobenzene is included in a broader discussion about VOCs and calibration processes, but lacks detailed interaction or significance within the context provided.",
