    "context": "Oxidative benzene reactions are generally understood. However, chemical-kinetic mechanisms have not developed completely for every important intermediate species. This study uses flow reactor experiments and chemical-kinetic modeling to explore the reaction pathways of chlorobenzene at moderate temperatures and fuel-lean conditions. The study focuses on the analogies between benzene and chlorobenzene oxidation. These two compounds are separately injected into a flow reactor; the concentrations of these species and their decomposition products are measured and compared. This experimental data is also used to validate the chemical kinetic models. The modeling provides a more detailed examination of the injected compound\u2019s reaction pathways. ",
