    "context": "The regeneration under air flow at 350\u00b0C for 5h did not allow to remove all the chlorine contained in the used catalyst. Although residual chlorine was still present after the regeneration, the initial activity was almost totally recovered. TG/DT analysis showed that residual chlorine was strongly linked to the solid and that it cannot be eliminated at temperatures lower than 650\u00b0C. On the contrary to toluene oxidation, TG/DTA results also demonstrated that no coke deposit was formed during the oxidation of chlorobenzene. Thermal oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in an incinerator is a common waste-disposal method. Under ideal conditions, chlorinated hydrocarbons oxidize to H2O, CO2 and HCl. The HCl can be removed easily with exhaust gas processing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene oxidation are discussed in relation to their thermal oxidation processes. The text highlights that during toluene oxidation, coke deposits are formed, whereas no such deposits occur during chlorobenzene oxidation. This indicates a difference in the oxidation behavior of these two compounds, suggesting that chlorobenzene may be more favorable for certain waste disposal methods due to its lack of coke formation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and toluene oxidation, as the context provides evidence of their differing oxidation behaviors and implications for waste disposal. The discussion of coke formation during toluene oxidation versus chlorobenzene indicates a clear relationship in their chemical processes.",
        "score": 4
