    "context": "In a previous paper, we have reported a work on the optimization of the catalytic formula of manganese/copper mixed oxides supported on TiO2 anatase (Mn1\u2212y Cu y O x /TiO2) for toluene oxidation. The catalytic activity was found to vary with the Mn/Cu ratio and MnCuO x /TiO2 catalyst (Mn/Cu=1) gave the best result which was explained by the formation of Mn1.6Cu1.4O4 spinel phase. In this work, we investigated the oxidation of chlorobenzene (CB) used as Cl-VOC model, focusing on: (i) activity of this catalyst in terms of CB conversion; (ii) reaction products distribution; and (iii) catalyst deactivation and regeneration. Catalyst preparation The support used was TiO2 anatase supplied by Saint-Gobain NorPro with the following properties: pellets of 8mm height and 3mm diameter, pore volume of 0.38cm3 g\u22121 and an average pore diameter of 15nm. TiO2 pellets were slightly crushed then sieved in order to obtain grains of size ranging between 0.2 and 0.4mm. The preparation of supported manganese/copper oxide catalyst was carried out by the incipient wetness impregnation method. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is investigated as a model compound for oxidation reactions using a manganese/copper mixed oxide catalyst supported on TiO2. The study focuses on the catalytic activity for chlorobenzene conversion, the distribution of reaction products, and the catalyst's performance, indicating a direct relationship between chlorobenzene and oxidation processes. The optimization of the catalyst is aimed at enhancing the oxidation efficiency of chlorobenzene, highlighting its significance in the study of catalytic oxidation reactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chlorobenzene and oxidation, as the study specifically examines the catalytic oxidation of chlorobenzene, providing evidence of its conversion and the role of the catalyst in this process.",
