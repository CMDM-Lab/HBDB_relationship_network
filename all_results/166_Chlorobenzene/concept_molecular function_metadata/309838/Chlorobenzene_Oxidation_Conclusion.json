    "context": "The regeneration under air flow at 350\u00b0C for 5h did not allow to remove all the chlorine contained in the used catalyst. Although residual chlorine was still present after the regeneration, the initial activity was almost totally recovered. TG/DT analysis showed that residual chlorine was strongly linked to the solid and that it cannot be eliminated at temperatures lower than 650\u00b0C. On the contrary to toluene oxidation, TG/DTA results also demonstrated that no coke deposit was formed during the oxidation of chlorobenzene. Thermal oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in an incinerator is a common waste-disposal method. Under ideal conditions, chlorinated hydrocarbons oxidize to H2O, CO2 and HCl. The HCl can be removed easily with exhaust gas processing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its oxidation process, particularly in the context of waste disposal methods. The text highlights that chlorobenzene undergoes thermal oxidation, resulting in the formation of water, carbon dioxide, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Unlike toluene, chlorobenzene does not produce coke deposits during oxidation, indicating a distinct behavior in its oxidative degradation. This suggests a significant relationship between chlorobenzene and oxidation processes in waste management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chlorobenzene and oxidation, as the text provides specific details about the oxidation process of chlorobenzene, including the products formed and its comparison to toluene. This indicates a clear relevance in the context of chemical degradation.",
        "score": 4
