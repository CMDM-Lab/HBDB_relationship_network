    "context": "The product, the final 3\u20134g of transparent yellow powder-like vitreous, was obtained by drying the yellow solution using hair-drying machine. The coating solution was prepared by 1g of pure peroxopolytungsten acid powder dissolved in absolute ethanol. It was immobilized directly onto the surface of K+-exchanged glass OWG by means of spin-coating with rotation speed of 1300rpm and rotation period of 25s. The thickness and refractive index of PTA thin film that dried at 180\u00b0C for 90min were 43nm and 1.89, respectively, using ellipsometry analysis.Absorbance spectra determination An UV- 2450 (Japan) single beam spectrophotometer connected to a computer was used for recording the absorbance changes of the PTA thin film before and after exposed to chlorobenzene gas. The sensing membrane immobilized onto the surface of K+-exchanged glass OWG was placed and fixed inside the quartz cell, after 20mL of saturated vapor of xylene injected to the thin film, the lid of the quartz cell was sealed, and the absorbance spectra was obtained.Measurement procedures As shown in Fig. 1 , the experimental set up for measuring the response of the PTA thin film/K+-exchanged glass OWG to chlorobenzene gas was constructed from PTA thin film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sample, a He\u2013Ne laser, a pair of prism couplers, a flow chamber, compressed air sources, a flowmeter, a diffusion tube, and a computer. The PTA thin film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor device was mounted on a rotational stage equipped with X\u2013Y\u2013Z translation, and a flow chamber (2cm\u00d71cm\u00d71cm) attached in the middle of the sample, covered the entire PTA thin film. For the measurement of waveguides, the basic investigation is to couple the light into and out of the waveguides. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a gas to which a PTA thin film sensor is exposed for absorbance spectrum analysis. However, there is no mention or discussion of 'adjudication' in relation to chlorobenzene or its measurement. The terms appear in the same context but are unrelated in function or significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that chlorobenzene and adjudication are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect relationship. They do not interact or share relevance in the described experimental setup.",
