    "context": "Determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) discharged from industries, vehicles, homes, and living organisms is of particular concern, because they can cause serious impacts on the environment and public health. Among them, most of halogenated VOCs are environmentally hazardous chemicals which threaten human health and other biological systems. In particular, chlorobenzene has been classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a hazardous waste, priority toxic pollutant, and carcinogen. Permissible exposure limit value of chlorobenzene, recommended by American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), is 75ppm and the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) level is 2400ppm in air, the prevention of adverse toxicological effect of chlorobenzene concentration in water is 115ppm and 4.7ppm to prevent adverse organoleptic effect. Because of its acute toxicity, there is a great demand for a system that can detect chlorobenzene at sub-parts per million (ppm) or lower concentrations. Reported spectrometry- or spectroscopy-based [6\u20139] chlorbenzene detectors are accurate, yet bulky, expensive, and time-consuming. In comparison, chemical sensors are small in size, inexpensive and can be used in portable and real-time monitoring devices. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as a hazardous volatile organic compound (VOC) with significant health risks, including acute toxicity. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of esthesia, which typically refers to sensation or perception, particularly in a medical context. The relationship between chlorobenzene and esthesia is not established, as the focus is primarily on the environmental and health impacts of chlorobenzene exposure without linking it to sensory effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between chlorobenzene and esthesia. They are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion of how chlorobenzene affects sensory perception or any related physiological effects.",
