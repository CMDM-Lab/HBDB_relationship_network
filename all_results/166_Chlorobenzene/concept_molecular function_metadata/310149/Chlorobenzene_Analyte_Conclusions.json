    "context": "Nonetheless, a denuder with a PLOT type stationary phase can be utilized for isolation and enrichment of analytes from air in long term research projects, for example. This paper presents the results of a study of the sorption properties of denudation traps prepared out of segments of different types of commercial capillary chromatographic columns. In the equilibrium sorption technique applied, the knowledge of the values of the analyte partition coefficients (K fs) makes it possible to determine their concentration in the sample being analyzed on the basis of the amount of analyte collected in the trap. The values of coefficients of partition between the gaseous phase and the stationary phase film were determined for group BTEX analytes, as well as chlorobenzene, by utilizing denudation traps of the following types: WCOT (PDMS, 12 and 18 \u03bcm) SCOT (PDMS, 5 \u03bcm) and PLOT (PORAPAK Q, 10 \u03bcm). The comparison of the obtained results with those by other authors leads to the conclusion that the values of the partition coefficients of analytes do not depend on the thickness or the manner of applying the stationary phase film. Also, no dependence was found, in the case of the PDMS stationary phase, between the partition coefficient value and the analyte isolation technique. The study of the sorption properties of denudation traps utilizing a segment of a capillary chromatographic column of the PLOT type demonstrated that utilization of this type of denuder may be not so straightforward, especially for determining temporary concentrations, keeping in mind the long time required to achieve the equilibrium state.
