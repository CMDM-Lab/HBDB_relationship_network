    "context": "This increase only can be explained for the molar fraction reduction, in the standards P10-C, of those analytes with higher affinity. Chlorinated methanes, CT and CF, showed a significant increase of sensitivity with the aqueous standards prepared with P10-C (Fig. 5 ). For both compounds this increase was related to the increase of their molar fraction and the reduction of VOCs concentration in 50.6% in these standards in comparison to P10. For the selected aromatic compounds, MCB showed a similar sensitivity for both standards despite the reduction of its molar fraction, and the increase of VOCs concentration in the standards P10-C (Fig. 5). Just as PCE or TCE, this compound also has a high affinity to the fiber. Finally, toluene showed lower linearity with the aqueous standards prepared with P10-C, for concentrations higher than 5\u03bcg/L, because in these standards the VOCs concentration was much higher, 12.3 times, than in the standards P10 (Fig. 5). This low linearity probably indicates the saturation of the fiber. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed as one of the selected aromatic compounds analyzed for sensitivity in aqueous standards. The relationship indicates that chlorobenzene, as an aromatic compound, exhibits specific behaviors in terms of sensitivity and affinity in the presence of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the context does not delve deeply into the unique characteristics or interactions of chlorobenzene compared to other aromatic compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene is identified as an aromatic compound and its behavior is analyzed in relation to other VOCs. However, the context lacks detailed exploration of its specific interactions or significance within the broader category of aromatic compounds.",
        "score": 3
