    "context": "The signal intensity increases with the decrease of polarity (Table 1), as Black and Fine indicated. For the selected aromatic compounds (Fig. 2c), the higher sensitivity of toluene only can be explained by K H and polarity factors. If we compare the calibration curves between compounds of different groups, the analyte selectivity of the fiber still can be explained, except for 1,1-DCE and CT, by K H. For the low sensitivity compounds (MCB, 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, CT, CF and DCM) this relation is valid from a minimum amount of carbon in the aqueous standard of approximately 100nmol. In this case, the relation with the other factors is not clear. However, the compounds which showed the calibration curves with highest linearity (PCE, TCE, toluene and MCB) are the compounds with lowest P 0. To test if the competition process produces an isotopic effect on C isotopes, aqueous standard solutions of selected compounds at different concentration were prepared with the standard stock solutions P10 and P10-C (Fig. 3). When an analyte has the same concentration in two aqueous standard solutions, one prepared with the stock solution P10 and the other with P10-C, the total concentration of VOCs in each standard will be different.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) are both mentioned in relation to the analysis of aromatic compounds and their calibration curves. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between these two compounds. The focus is more on the sensitivity and selectivity of various compounds in analytical methods rather than on a functional or chemical relationship between chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III).",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) in the context, as they are merely mentioned alongside other compounds without any direct interaction or relevance.",
