    "context": "Both ranges are compound specific. A new cathode in the IRMS system was used in these tests. The precision obtained was below 0.5\u2030, except for chlorinated methanes that was \u22640.7\u2030. All the compounds with high linearity (PCE, TCE, toluene and MCB) also have a high precision, below 0.5\u2030. Concerning accuracy, in relation to the EA-IRMS values, CT and CF exhibit the highest deviations (Table 2). This fractionation can be corrected because it was approximately constant in the selected intensity range, was not affected by competitive extraction and high precision of the isotope composition of the extracted compounds from the aqueous standards and pure phase compounds was reached. The results obtained validated the use of CAR\u2013PDMS coating for CSIA, of the selected compounds in multi-component aqueous samples in the low concentration range observed in contaminated groundwater.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as compounds analyzed for their isotopic composition in a study involving contaminated groundwater. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework. They are treated as separate entities within the context of compound-specific analysis, lacking direct interaction or comparative significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as chlorobenzene and toluene are both part of the same analytical study but are not directly related or compared in terms of their chemical properties or interactions. Their mention is coincidental rather than indicative of a significant relationship.",
