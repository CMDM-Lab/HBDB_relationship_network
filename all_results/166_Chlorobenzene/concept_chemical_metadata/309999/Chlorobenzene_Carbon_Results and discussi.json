    "context": "The signal intensity increases with the decrease of polarity (Table 1), as Black and Fine indicated. For the selected aromatic compounds (Fig. 2c), the higher sensitivity of toluene only can be explained by K H and polarity factors. If we compare the calibration curves between compounds of different groups, the analyte selectivity of the fiber still can be explained, except for 1,1-DCE and CT, by K H. For the low sensitivity compounds (MCB, 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, CT, CF and DCM) this relation is valid from a minimum amount of carbon in the aqueous standard of approximately 100nmol. In this case, the relation with the other factors is not clear. However, the compounds which showed the calibration curves with highest linearity (PCE, TCE, toluene and MCB) are the compounds with lowest P 0. To test if the competition process produces an isotopic effect on C isotopes, aqueous standard solutions of selected compounds at different concentration were prepared with the standard stock solutions P10 and P10-C (Fig. 3). When an analyte has the same concentration in two aqueous standard solutions, one prepared with the stock solution P10 and the other with P10-C, the total concentration of VOCs in each standard will be different.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed as an aromatic compound in relation to its sensitivity and calibration curves in aqueous solutions, which are influenced by the amount of carbon present. The relationship indicates that the sensitivity of chlorobenzene and other compounds is affected by carbon concentration, suggesting a connection between the compound's behavior in analytical methods and its carbon content. However, the specifics of chlorobenzene's interaction with carbon are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene's sensitivity in analytical methods is linked to carbon concentration, indicating some level of interaction. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration, preventing a higher score.",
