    "context": "High precision of \u03b4 13C values is necessary to assess accurately biodegradation of organic compounds using the stable carbon isotope approach. In aquifers contaminated with organic compounds, under specific range of redox conditions, biodegradation can be the most significant natural attenuation process. Material and methods The isotopic analyses were performed in the laboratories of the Serveis Cientificot\u00e8cnics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. DCM, CF and toluene were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, TCE, PCE and MCB from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA), and CT from Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn (Seelze, Germany). For the preparation of internal standards, the 13C composition of pure phase of each compound was determined using an elemental analysis system coupled to IRMS (EA\u2013IRMS). Volumes of 1\u03bcL for toluene and MCB and 2\u03bcL for chlorinated methanes and ethenes were inserted into the EA\u2013IRMS system using tin capsules for liquids. Subsequently, some repetitions were done with direct liquid injection and the results obtained were the same in the range of analytical uncertainty, confirming the results obtained with tin capsules.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) are both mentioned as part of a study involving the biodegradation of organic compounds in aquifers. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between the two compounds. Chlorobenzene is listed among other organic compounds analyzed for isotopic composition, while dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) is not specifically addressed in relation to chlorobenzene or the biodegradation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) in the context provided. They are mentioned in the same study but without any direct connection or interaction discussed.",
