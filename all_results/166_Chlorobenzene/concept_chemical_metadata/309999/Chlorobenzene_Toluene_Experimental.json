    "context": "Material and methods The isotopic analyses were performed in the laboratories of the Serveis Cientificot\u00e8cnics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. DCM, CF and toluene were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, TCE, PCE and MCB from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA), and CT from Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn (Seelze, Germany). For the preparation of internal standards, the 13C composition of pure phase of each compound was determined using an elemental analysis system coupled to IRMS (EA\u2013IRMS). Volumes of 1\u03bcL for toluene and MCB and 2\u03bcL for chlorinated methanes and ethenes were inserted into the EA\u2013IRMS system using tin capsules for liquids. Subsequently, some repetitions were done with direct liquid injection and the results obtained were the same in the range of analytical uncertainty, confirming the results obtained with tin capsules. Standard stock solutions of multi-component mixtures were prepared by dissolution of pure phase compounds in HPLC-grade methanol. For D-SPME tests, multi-component standard solutions were prepared by dissolving a standard stock solution of PCE, TCE and cis-DCE, at the same concentration, in ultra pure water (Milli-Q) with a final volume of 100mL.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as compounds used in isotopic analyses and standard solution preparations. They are part of a broader study involving various organic solvents, but there is no specific discussion of their chemical interactions or functional relationships. Their mention is primarily related to their roles as analytical standards rather than any direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as chlorobenzene and toluene are listed together in the context of analytical methods without any detailed discussion of their interactions or significance beyond being part of the same study.",
