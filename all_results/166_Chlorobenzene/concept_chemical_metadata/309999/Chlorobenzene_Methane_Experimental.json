    "context": "Material and methods The isotopic analyses were performed in the laboratories of the Serveis Cientificot\u00e8cnics, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. DCM, CF and toluene were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); 1,1-DCE, cis-DCE, TCE, PCE and MCB from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA), and CT from Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn (Seelze, Germany). For the preparation of internal standards, the 13C composition of pure phase of each compound was determined using an elemental analysis system coupled to IRMS (EA\u2013IRMS). Volumes of 1\u03bcL for toluene and MCB and 2\u03bcL for chlorinated methanes and ethenes were inserted into the EA\u2013IRMS system using tin capsules for liquids. Subsequently, some repetitions were done with direct liquid injection and the results obtained were the same in the range of analytical uncertainty, confirming the results obtained with tin capsules. Standard stock solutions of multi-component mixtures were prepared by dissolution of pure phase compounds in HPLC-grade methanol. For D-SPME tests, multi-component standard solutions were prepared by dissolving a standard stock solution of PCE, TCE and cis-DCE, at the same concentration, in ultra pure water (Milli-Q) with a final volume of 100mL.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and methane are both mentioned as part of a broader discussion on isotopic analyses and the preparation of standard solutions for various compounds. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship established between chlorobenzene and methane, as they are simply listed among other chemicals used in the study without any specific mention of their functional or chemical connections.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as chlorobenzene and methane are only mentioned in the context of chemical preparation and analysis, with no direct relevance or interaction discussed between the two compounds.",
