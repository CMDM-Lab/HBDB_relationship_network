    "context": "A drawback is that, with increasing temperature, the gas/fiber distribution coefficient decreases. To outline the applied method, we used six vials with a total volume of 118 cm3. In groups of three experiments, the volume of water was constant at 90 or 0.5 cm3. Five microlitre of a methanolic stock solution of 1,2-dichloropropane and chlorobenzene or in separate experiments a solution of chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, trichloroethene, benzene and toluene was injected into the thermostated vials. After incubation overnight, the headspace was sampled with a 100 \u03bcm dimethylpolysiloxane fiber (Supelco). After sampling, analysis was carried out with a Varian gas chromatograph (Model 3700) on a 30 m CP-SIL 5 CB FSOT capillary column (0.53 mm ID, film thickness 5 \u03bcm). The Henry's law constant was calculated via the formula (Gossett, 1987): (16) H= rV w1 \u2212V w2 V g2 \u2212rV g1 where r is the ratio of the headspace concentrations (r=C g1/C g2, with C g1 and C g2 the concentrations in the closed two-phase system with a low (w 1) and a high liquid content (w 2), respectively).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and dichloropropane are both mentioned as components of a methanolic stock solution used in experiments to analyze their behavior in a gas/fiber distribution system. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relationships beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup, indicating they are treated as separate entities in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as chlorobenzene and dichloropropane are mentioned together in the context of an experimental method, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between them.",
        "score": 2
