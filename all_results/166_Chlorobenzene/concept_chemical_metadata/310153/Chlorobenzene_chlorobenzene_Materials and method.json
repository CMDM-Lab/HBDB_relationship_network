    "context": "A drawback is that, with increasing temperature, the gas/fiber distribution coefficient decreases. To outline the applied method, we used six vials with a total volume of 118 cm3. In groups of three experiments, the volume of water was constant at 90 or 0.5 cm3. Five microlitre of a methanolic stock solution of 1,2-dichloropropane and chlorobenzene or in separate experiments a solution of chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, trichloroethene, benzene and toluene was injected into the thermostated vials. After incubation overnight, the headspace was sampled with a 100 \u03bcm dimethylpolysiloxane fiber (Supelco). After sampling, analysis was carried out with a Varian gas chromatograph (Model 3700) on a 30 m CP-SIL 5 CB FSOT capillary column (0.53 mm ID, film thickness 5 \u03bcm). The Henry's law constant was calculated via the formula (Gossett, 1987): (16) H= rV w1 \u2212V w2 V g2 \u2212rV g1 where r is the ratio of the headspace concentrations (r=C g1/C g2, with C g1 and C g2 the concentrations in the closed two-phase system with a low (w 1) and a high liquid content (w 2), respectively).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as part of a methanolic stock solution used in experiments involving gas/fiber distribution coefficients and headspace sampling. The text does not differentiate between 'Chlorobenzene' and 'chlorobenzene', indicating they refer to the same compound. However, there is no discussion of its chemical properties, interactions, or relevance to the study's outcomes, leading to a lack of meaningful relationship between the terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that both terms refer to the same chemical compound, chlorobenzene, but there is no discussion of their relationship or significance in the context provided. They appear coincidentally without any functional or experimental relevance.",
