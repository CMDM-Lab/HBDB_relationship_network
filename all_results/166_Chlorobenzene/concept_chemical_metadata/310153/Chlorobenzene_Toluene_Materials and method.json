    "context": "A drawback is that, with increasing temperature, the gas/fiber distribution coefficient decreases. To outline the applied method, we used six vials with a total volume of 118 cm3. In groups of three experiments, the volume of water was constant at 90 or 0.5 cm3. Five microlitre of a methanolic stock solution of 1,2-dichloropropane and chlorobenzene or in separate experiments a solution of chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, trichloroethene, benzene and toluene was injected into the thermostated vials. After incubation overnight, the headspace was sampled with a 100 \u03bcm dimethylpolysiloxane fiber (Supelco). After sampling, analysis was carried out with a Varian gas chromatograph (Model 3700) on a 30 m CP-SIL 5 CB FSOT capillary column (0.53 mm ID, film thickness 5 \u03bcm). The Henry's law constant was calculated via the formula (Gossett, 1987): (16) H= rV w1 \u2212V w2 V g2 \u2212rV g1 where r is the ratio of the headspace concentrations (r=C g1/C g2, with C g1 and C g2 the concentrations in the closed two-phase system with a low (w 1) and a high liquid content (w 2), respectively).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of a methanolic stock solution used in gas chromatography experiments. They are analyzed in relation to their distribution coefficients and behavior in a closed two-phase system. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene and toluene are both included in the same experimental context but without any direct interaction or functional relationship discussed. Their mention is more about their roles in the experiment rather than a significant connection.",
