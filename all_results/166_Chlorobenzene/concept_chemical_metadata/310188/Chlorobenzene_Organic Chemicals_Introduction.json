    "context": "Although pyrolysis of CB results mainly in chlorine abstraction, OH radical reaction with CB cannot lead only to OH addition, but also to hydrogen abstraction. This latter mechanism, favoured at higher temperatures, as occurring in ultrasound, results in chlorinated phenyl radicals. However, due to the low initial concentrations of CB and knowing that the yield of individual volatile intermediates is typically in the order of 1%, analytical methodology could be the major obstacle to prove OH radical induced degradation. Toluene and chlorobenzene are two typical aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are mainly emitted from chemical process industries, including painting, coating, rubber, and so on (Lillo-R\u00f3denas et\u00a0al., 2005). Aromatic VOCs are seriously toxic to human living conditions and healths, and even though at very low concentrations. They can lead to eye and throat irritation, damage to liver and central nervous system (Das et\u00a0al., 2004). In addition, as important contributors and precursor to air pollution, they can also contribute to the ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, which makes up photochemical smog (Guenther et\u00a0al., 1995; Riipinen et\u00a0al., 2012).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene (CB) is identified as a specific type of organic chemical, particularly an aromatic volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from various chemical industries. The discussion highlights the toxic effects of aromatic VOCs, including chlorobenzene, on human health and their role in contributing to air pollution and photochemical smog. This establishes a clear relationship between chlorobenzene and the broader category of organic chemicals, emphasizing its significance as a harmful environmental pollutant.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and organic chemicals, as chlorobenzene is explicitly categorized as an aromatic VOC, which is a subset of organic chemicals. The context discusses its toxic effects and environmental impact, providing strong contextual support for their relationship.",
        "score": 4
