    "context": "However, these works are always based on the breakthrough curves, surface functional groups characteristic and thermodynamic predictions but adsorption isotherms, due to the difficult and poisonous measurements to investigate the adsorption equilibrium curves of aromatic VOCs by conventional experimental methods. In fact, based on the theoretical analysis, some researchers have systematically developed molecular simulation models with random packing of carbon sheets for disordered activated carbon building to better predict the adsorption behaviors of small molecules (Kim et\u00a0al., 2006; Di Biase and Sarkisov, 2015). Therefore, the way using theoretical calculation to simulate adsorption isotherms and then explore that appropriate models of adsorption thermodynamics for aromatic VOCs on activated carbon is advisable and feasible. In this study, coconut shell derived activated carbon are prepared, investigated and compared with commercial coal activated carbon on the toluene and chlorobenzene adsorption performance. The pore structures, surface features and the physicochemical properties of adsorbents are investigated by N2 adsorption, FTIR, Raman and XPS. On the basis of geometry optimization and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation, the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic parameters are well predicted. Moreover, dynamic adsorption behaviors and equilibrium isotherms of toluene and chlorobenzene are also fitted by multiple theory models to analyze adsorption mechanism and structure-activity relationship in this paper.
