    "context": "It is obvious that the relative mass of chlorobenzene is larger resulting in a greater adsorption potential. Therefore, the adsorption for chlorobenzene on CDC embodies better adsorption performance. The adsorption capacity of toluene and chlorobenzene on coconut shell derived carbon has been investigated, analyzed and compared with commercial activated carbon. It is found that raw materials of coconut shell contribute to developed micropore structure, narrow pore size distribution and less carbonyl group on CDC, which is better for toluene and chlorobenzene removal. There are two major reasons as follows: (1) Suitable pore size (size\u202f<\u202f0.8\u202fnm) leads to larger interaction on adsorbents for aromatic VOCs adsorption based on the micropore filling theory. However, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl found in CAC may reduce the surface electron density weakening the interactions between adsorbents and adsorbates. (2) According to the results of isotherms fits, it can be deduced that chlorobenzene adsorption on CDC exhibits greater affinity (Lennard\u2013Jones potential) than toluene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption performance on coconut shell-derived carbon (CDC) compared to commercial activated carbon (CAC). The presence of carbonyl groups in CAC is noted to weaken the interactions between the adsorbent and chlorobenzene due to reduced surface electron density. This suggests that the carbonyl group negatively impacts the adsorption capacity of chlorobenzene, highlighting a significant relationship between the two terms in the context of adsorption efficiency.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and the carbonyl group, as the presence of carbonyl groups in CAC is shown to adversely affect the adsorption of chlorobenzene. The context provides evidence of this relationship through comparative analysis of adsorption performance.",
