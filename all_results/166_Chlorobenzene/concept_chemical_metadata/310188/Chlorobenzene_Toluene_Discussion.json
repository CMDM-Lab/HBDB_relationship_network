    "context": "Hence, the smaller graphitic crystallite size with less disordered structure contributes to a better adsorption performance (CDC). Due to the unstable structure, abundant of carbonyl groups formed in the oxidation pathway on CAC(Gong et\u00a0al., 1998). In addition, based on the fitting result from LDF and Y-N models, the diffusion resistance in CDC is significantly less than that of CAC.Comparison of adsorbates Aiming at comparing chlorobenzene and toluene adsorption process on CDC, the adsorption isotherm was compared and investigated. The relevant variables such as K H and q st are obtained by theory calculation and models fits, which reveal that the chlorobenzene adsorption on CDC is much easier than toluene adsorption. Because of Henry's law which CDC adsorption obeys at low pressure, the deviation of the T\u1f78th and Langmuir model occurs. In contrast, the D-A model, based on the potential theory, can well describe the adsorption equilibrium for different adsorbates. As is proposed before, field-dipole and field gradient\u2013quadrupole interactions, deriving from an electrical field in the region of the adsorbent surface, can be negligible for the system of non-polar activated carbon adsorption (Giraudet et\u00a0al., 2006).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are compared regarding their adsorption processes on a specific carbon adsorbent (CDC). The study indicates that chlorobenzene adsorbs more readily than toluene, as evidenced by the adsorption isotherm analysis. The findings suggest that the structural properties of the adsorbent influence the adsorption efficiency of these two volatile organic compounds, highlighting their differing behaviors in adsorption dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and toluene, as the context provides evidence of their comparative adsorption characteristics on CDC, supported by theoretical calculations and model fits. This indicates a clear relationship in the context of adsorption processes.",
