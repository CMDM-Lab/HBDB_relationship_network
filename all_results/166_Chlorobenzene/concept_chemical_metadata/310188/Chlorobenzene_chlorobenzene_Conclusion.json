    "context": "There are two major reasons as follows: (1) Suitable pore size (size\u202f<\u202f0.8\u202fnm) leads to larger interaction on adsorbents for aromatic VOCs adsorption based on the micropore filling theory. However, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl found in CAC may reduce the surface electron density weakening the interactions between adsorbents and adsorbates. (2) According to the results of isotherms fits, it can be deduced that chlorobenzene adsorption on CDC exhibits greater affinity (Lennard\u2013Jones potential) than toluene. Furthermore, the more polarized electrons of chlorobenzene enhance the adsorbate\u2013adsorbent interaction, which makes chlorobenzene more easily adsorbed on the adsorbent. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major air pollutants in indoor environments, which significantly impact indoor quality, and thus are of growing concern to human health. Due to their common use in manufacturing processes, VOCs originate from a large variety of indoor sources including building materials, furnishings, cleaning supplies and pesticides and are frequently found indoors at levels exceeding those outdoors (EPA, 2007). At high levels of exposure, many VOCs are known to cause toxic effects, whereas low levels have been linked to airway inflammation and alterations in immune cell function, with a subsequent risk for development of allergies and asthma (Diez et al., 2000; Lehmann et al., 2001, 2002).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption properties on adsorbents, particularly in comparison to toluene. The text highlights that chlorobenzene exhibits a greater affinity for adsorption due to its more polarized electrons, which enhance interactions with adsorbents. This indicates a significant role of chlorobenzene in studies of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their impact on indoor air quality.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between chlorobenzene and its adsorption characteristics, emphasizing its relevance in the context of VOCs and indoor air quality. The detailed discussion of its properties and interactions supports this strong connection.",
        "score": 5
