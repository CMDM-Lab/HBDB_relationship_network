    "context": "A cubic simulation box with a side of 33.7\u202f\u00c5 in length was considered and 64 BSUs were randomly packed in it and placed periodic boundary conditions. GCMC simulation was implemented using the sorption module of the Material Studio. Further details of GCMC simulation protocol adopted in this work, including details of the potential cut-offs, number of Monte Carlo moves per adsorption point, type and weight of Monte Carlo moves and other parameters, were provided in the SI file. Adsorption equilibrium isotherms of toluene and chlorobenzene on the CDC sample were fitted with Langmuir, T\u1f78th and Dubinin\u2013Astakhov (D\u2013A) isotherm models (Mertens, 2009; Purewal et\u00a0al., 2012). Dynamic adsorption and desorption behaviors The adsorption breakthrough and TPD curves of chlorobenzene and toluene on CDC and CAC are shown in Fig.\u00a02 , and corresponding parameters are collected in Table\u00a01 . It can be seen that the dynamic adsorption capacity decreases with the order of CSDC\u202f>\u202fCAC (272 and 252\u202fmg/g for chlorobenzene, respectively). Meanwhile, chlorobenzene is adsorbed more easily than toluene for the same adsorbent due to its shorter breakthrough time but higher capacity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both analyzed for their adsorption behaviors on CDC and CAC adsorbents using GCMC simulation. The study indicates that chlorobenzene is adsorbed more easily than toluene, as evidenced by its shorter breakthrough time and higher dynamic adsorption capacity. This suggests a competitive relationship in terms of adsorption efficiency on the same materials.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and toluene, supported by quantitative data on their adsorption characteristics. The study provides evidence of their comparative adsorption behaviors, indicating a clear relationship in the context of material science and chemical interactions.",
