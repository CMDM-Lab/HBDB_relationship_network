    "context": "The value of \u03b1 increases with the relative molecular/atomic mass due to the participation of more polarized electrons. It is obvious that the relative mass of chlorobenzene is larger resulting in a greater adsorption potential. Therefore, the adsorption for chlorobenzene on CDC embodies better adsorption performance. The adsorption capacity of toluene and chlorobenzene on coconut shell derived carbon has been investigated, analyzed and compared with commercial activated carbon. It is found that raw materials of coconut shell contribute to developed micropore structure, narrow pore size distribution and less carbonyl group on CDC, which is better for toluene and chlorobenzene removal. There are two major reasons as follows: (1) Suitable pore size (size\u202f<\u202f0.8\u202fnm) leads to larger interaction on adsorbents for aromatic VOCs adsorption based on the micropore filling theory. However, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl found in CAC may reduce the surface electron density weakening the interactions between adsorbents and adsorbates. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption performance on carbon materials, specifically coconut shell-derived carbon (CDC) and commercial activated carbon (CAC). The study highlights that the structural properties of carbon, such as pore size and surface characteristics, significantly influence the adsorption capacity for chlorobenzene. The comparison indicates that CDC has better adsorption potential for chlorobenzene due to its suitable micropore structure, which enhances interactions with aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and carbon, as the context provides evidence of how carbon's structural properties affect chlorobenzene's adsorption performance. The detailed analysis of adsorption capacity supports a clear relationship.",
