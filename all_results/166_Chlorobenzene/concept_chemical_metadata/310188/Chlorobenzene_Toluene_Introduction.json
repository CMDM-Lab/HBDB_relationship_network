    "context": "In this study, coconut shell derived activated carbon are prepared, investigated and compared with commercial coal activated carbon on the toluene and chlorobenzene adsorption performance. The pore structures, surface features and the physicochemical properties of adsorbents are investigated by N2 adsorption, FTIR, Raman and XPS. On the basis of geometry optimization and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation, the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic parameters are well predicted. Moreover, dynamic adsorption behaviors and equilibrium isotherms of toluene and chlorobenzene are also fitted by multiple theory models to analyze adsorption mechanism and structure-activity relationship in this paper. Preparation of adsorbents The preparation of coconut shells derived carbon was similar with Hu's method except steam activation(Hu and Srinivasan, 1999). Typically, the coconut shells were crushed and sieved to 20\u201360 mesh, then dried them at 120\u202f\u00b0C for 8\u202fh in vacuum. The certain amounts of raw materials were pyrolyzed at 1173\u202fK in a tube furnace under nitrogen gas flow. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both evaluated for their adsorption performance on activated carbon derived from coconut shells. The study investigates the adsorption mechanisms and compares the physicochemical properties of the adsorbents in relation to their ability to adsorb these two volatile organic compounds. While both compounds are analyzed together, the specific interactions or differences in their adsorption characteristics are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene and toluene are both part of the same study focusing on adsorption performance. Their relationship is significant in the context of adsorption mechanisms, but the details of their interaction or comparative analysis are not extensively discussed.",
        "score": 3
