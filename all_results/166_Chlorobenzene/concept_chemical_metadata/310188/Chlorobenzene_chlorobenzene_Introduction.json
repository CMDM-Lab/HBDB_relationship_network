    "context": "In this study, coconut shell derived activated carbon are prepared, investigated and compared with commercial coal activated carbon on the toluene and chlorobenzene adsorption performance. The pore structures, surface features and the physicochemical properties of adsorbents are investigated by N2 adsorption, FTIR, Raman and XPS. On the basis of geometry optimization and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation, the adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic parameters are well predicted. Moreover, dynamic adsorption behaviors and equilibrium isotherms of toluene and chlorobenzene are also fitted by multiple theory models to analyze adsorption mechanism and structure-activity relationship in this paper. Preparation of adsorbents The preparation of coconut shells derived carbon was similar with Hu's method except steam activation(Hu and Srinivasan, 1999). Typically, the coconut shells were crushed and sieved to 20\u201360 mesh, then dried them at 120\u202f\u00b0C for 8\u202fh in vacuum. The certain amounts of raw materials were pyrolyzed at 1173\u202fK in a tube furnace under nitrogen gas flow. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a compound whose adsorption performance is being investigated alongside toluene using coconut shell-derived activated carbon. The study focuses on the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms of chlorobenzene, indicating its relevance in the context of environmental chemistry and material science. However, there is no additional detail provided about chlorobenzene's specific interactions or comparisons with other compounds beyond its role in adsorption studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene is included in the study of adsorption performance but lacks detailed discussion of its interactions or significance beyond being one of the compounds analyzed.",
