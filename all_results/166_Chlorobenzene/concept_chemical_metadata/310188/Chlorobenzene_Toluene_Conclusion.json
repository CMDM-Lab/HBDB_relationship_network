    "context": "It is found that raw materials of coconut shell contribute to developed micropore structure, narrow pore size distribution and less carbonyl group on CDC, which is better for toluene and chlorobenzene removal. There are two major reasons as follows: (1) Suitable pore size (size\u202f<\u202f0.8\u202fnm) leads to larger interaction on adsorbents for aromatic VOCs adsorption based on the micropore filling theory. However, the electron-withdrawing carbonyl found in CAC may reduce the surface electron density weakening the interactions between adsorbents and adsorbates. (2) According to the results of isotherms fits, it can be deduced that chlorobenzene adsorption on CDC exhibits greater affinity (Lennard\u2013Jones potential) than toluene. Furthermore, the more polarized electrons of chlorobenzene enhance the adsorbate\u2013adsorbent interaction, which makes chlorobenzene more easily adsorbed on the adsorbent. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are major air pollutants in indoor environments, which significantly impact indoor quality, and thus are of growing concern to human health. Due to their common use in manufacturing processes, VOCs originate from a large variety of indoor sources including building materials, furnishings, cleaning supplies and pesticides and are frequently found indoors at levels exceeding those outdoors (EPA, 2007).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) discussed in relation to their adsorption characteristics on adsorbents derived from coconut shell. The study indicates that chlorobenzene exhibits a greater affinity for adsorption compared to toluene due to its more polarized electrons, which enhance the interaction with the adsorbent. This suggests a significant difference in their behavior during adsorption processes, highlighting their relevance in the context of air quality and pollutant removal.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and toluene, as the context provides evidence of their differing adsorption affinities on adsorbents. The discussion of their interactions and implications for VOC removal supports a strong relationship.",
        "score": 4
