    "context": "In general, the adsorption potential includes dispersive energy, repulsive energy, the field-dipole interaction and field gradient-quadripole interaction, among which dispersive and repulsive energies are the contributor of adsorption potential. The potentials are affected by the intermolecular distance (r) and polarization (\u03b1), and the latter is the decisive parameter. In this study, both adsorbed molecules contain benzene ring, and the difference is the substitutional group. The larger polarization of Cl (2.18) leads to stronger interaction potential between chlorobenzene and adsorbent than C (1.76), thereby making chlorobenzene more easily adsorbed by CDC. Comparison of adsorbents It is meaningful to construct the structure-activity relationships between the physicochemical properties of the typical adsorbents and the VOCs. By comparing the adsorption performance between CDC and CAC, CDC is more suitable for the VOCs adsorption. The characterizations of BET and Raman show that the better performance for CDC attributes to the developed microporosity and suitable PSD, which usually play important roles in the adsorption process as suggested by previous researchers (Bhatia et\u00a0al., 2009; Lemus et\u00a0al., 2012).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption potential compared to other compounds. The text highlights that chlorobenzene, due to its chlorine substitution, exhibits greater polarization and stronger interaction potential with adsorbents than benzene. This suggests that chlorobenzene's chemical structure significantly influences its adsorption characteristics, making it more readily adsorbed by CDC compared to other VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and its adsorption properties, supported by evidence of its stronger interaction potential due to polarization. The context provides a clear relationship between the chemical structure of chlorobenzene and its behavior in adsorption processes.",
