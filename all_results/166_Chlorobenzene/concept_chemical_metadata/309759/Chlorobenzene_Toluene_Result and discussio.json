    "context": "Fig. 6 shows the response of the OWG sensor to 1000ppm of various gases. Experimental result shows that PTA film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor has strong responses to aromatic hydrocarbon gases such as benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, and xylene. But the responses to other VOCs are weaker. Among chlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, and xylene of the same concentration, the sensor has a higher response to chlorobenzene. Therefore, the typical response to the chlorobenzene gas of PTA film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor was mainly studied as discussed above. This study aims at reporting a new optical sensing platform based on planar optical waveguide sensor coated with PTA thin film. The PTA thin films/K+-exchanged OWGs were prepared with good optical and mechanical properties, and it was tested for some potential interference volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and it showed higher response to the chlorobenzene gas compared to other VOCs.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both aromatic hydrocarbons that are evaluated for their responses to a specific optical waveguide sensor. The study highlights that the sensor exhibits a stronger response to chlorobenzene compared to toluene and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While both compounds are mentioned together in the context of sensor response, the focus is primarily on chlorobenzene's interaction with the sensor rather than a direct comparison or relationship between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between chlorobenzene and toluene, as they are both aromatic hydrocarbons tested with the same sensor. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or functional relationships between them, limiting their relevance.",
        "score": 2
