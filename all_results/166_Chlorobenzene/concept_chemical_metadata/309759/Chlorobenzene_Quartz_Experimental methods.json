    "context": "The coating solution was prepared by 1g of pure peroxopolytungsten acid powder dissolved in absolute ethanol. It was immobilized directly onto the surface of K+-exchanged glass OWG by means of spin-coating with rotation speed of 1300rpm and rotation period of 25s. The thickness and refractive index of PTA thin film that dried at 180\u00b0C for 90min were 43nm and 1.89, respectively, using ellipsometry analysis.Absorbance spectra determination An UV- 2450 (Japan) single beam spectrophotometer connected to a computer was used for recording the absorbance changes of the PTA thin film before and after exposed to chlorobenzene gas. The sensing membrane immobilized onto the surface of K+-exchanged glass OWG was placed and fixed inside the quartz cell, after 20mL of saturated vapor of xylene injected to the thin film, the lid of the quartz cell was sealed, and the absorbance spectra was obtained.Measurement procedures As shown in Fig. 1 , the experimental set up for measuring the response of the PTA thin film/K+-exchanged glass OWG to chlorobenzene gas was constructed from PTA thin film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sample, a He\u2013Ne laser, a pair of prism couplers, a flow chamber, compressed air sources, a flowmeter, a diffusion tube, and a computer. The PTA thin film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor device was mounted on a rotational stage equipped with X\u2013Y\u2013Z translation, and a flow chamber (2cm\u00d71cm\u00d71cm) attached in the middle of the sample, covered the entire PTA thin film. For the measurement of waveguides, the basic investigation is to couple the light into and out of the waveguides. The commonly used methods were prism or grating coupling. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is used as a gas to test the response of a sensing membrane immobilized on a quartz cell. The quartz serves as a substrate for the PTA thin film, which interacts with chlorobenzene to measure absorbance changes. The relationship is primarily functional, where quartz acts as a medium for the detection of chlorobenzene's presence through optical measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene and quartz are connected through the experimental setup where quartz is used as a substrate for measuring the effects of chlorobenzene. However, the relationship is more about the application rather than a direct chemical interaction.",
