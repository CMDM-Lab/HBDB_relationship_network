    "context": "Preparation of the PTA/K+-exchanged OWG does not require expensive vacuum equipment. According to our survey, no OWG sensor that detects the VOC gases using PTA thin film has been reported. This paper reports the development of sensitive and reusable chlorobenzene gas sensor as a typical example of VOC gases based on PTA thin film immobilized onto a potassium ion (K+)-exchanged glass OWG by spin-coating method. It has been described that, in detail, the fabrication process of the sensor and the investigation of the sensor response to parts per million levels of chlorobenzene gas. Otherwise, several characteristics of the OWG testing system are discussed. K+-exchanged glass OWG preparation and characterization The K+-exchanged glass OWG device is fabricated on a soda-lime glass substrate (76mm\u00d726mm\u00d71mm), which contains different oxides such as SiO2, Na2O, and CaO, which were immersed in molten KNO3 salt at 400\u00b0C for 40min. The net index variation depends on the ionic polarizability, the molar volume, and the stress state created by the substitution. ",
