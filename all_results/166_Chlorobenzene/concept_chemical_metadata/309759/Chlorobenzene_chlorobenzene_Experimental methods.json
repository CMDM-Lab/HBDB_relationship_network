    "context": "The concentration of the chlorobenzene gas was confirmed by a commercial chlorobenzene gas detection tube (Gastec). Different amounts of standard chlorobenzene gas were diluted to obtain the desired concentrations with dry air in a second standard vessel (600cm3). Using this standard vessel dilution method, very low concentrations of chlorobenzene (in the ppm range) were obtained. A new glass syringe was used to inject the same volume of chlorobenzene sample into the flow cell. Performance of the sensor device The K+-exchanged glass OWG coated with PTA thin film was exposed to chlorobenzene gas and the absorbance was monitored. These results are presented in Fig. 2 . As shown, when the chlorobenzene gas exists, the absorbance decreases because of adsorption between chlorobenzene gas and PTA film. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned multiple times as a gas being detected and analyzed using a commercial gas detection tube. The study focuses on the concentration and performance of a sensor device in detecting chlorobenzene gas, highlighting its properties and interactions with the sensor material. The repeated mention of chlorobenzene indicates a clear focus on its detection and measurement, but there is no discussion of different forms or types of chlorobenzene, as both terms refer to the same compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and highly relevant relationship, as both terms refer to the same chemical compound, chlorobenzene, and the context discusses its detection and analysis in detail, emphasizing its significance in the study.",
        "score": 5
