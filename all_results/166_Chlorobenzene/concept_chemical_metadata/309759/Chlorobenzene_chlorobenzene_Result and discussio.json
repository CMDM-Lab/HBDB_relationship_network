    "context": "Experimental result shows that PTA film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor has strong responses to aromatic hydrocarbon gases such as benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, and xylene. But the responses to other VOCs are weaker. Among chlorobenzene, benzene, toluene, and xylene of the same concentration, the sensor has a higher response to chlorobenzene. Therefore, the typical response to the chlorobenzene gas of PTA film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor was mainly studied as discussed above. This study aims at reporting a new optical sensing platform based on planar optical waveguide sensor coated with PTA thin film. The PTA thin films/K+-exchanged OWGs were prepared with good optical and mechanical properties, and it was tested for some potential interference volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and it showed higher response to the chlorobenzene gas compared to other VOCs. Thus, the sensor mainly tested for chlorobenzene gas. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a specific aromatic hydrocarbon gas that the PTA film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor responds to. The study highlights that the sensor exhibits a stronger response to chlorobenzene compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, toluene, and xylene. This indicates a focused investigation on chlorobenzene's detection capabilities using the sensor technology.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and strong relevance between chlorobenzene and the sensor's response, as the study specifically investigates chlorobenzene's detection and emphasizes its higher response compared to other VOCs, establishing a critical relationship.",
        "score": 5
