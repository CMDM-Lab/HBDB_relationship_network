    "context": "The PTA thin films/K+-exchanged OWGs were prepared with good optical and mechanical properties, and it was tested for some potential interference volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and it showed higher response to the chlorobenzene gas compared to other VOCs. Thus, the sensor mainly tested for chlorobenzene gas. The results revealed that the detection limit of PTA thin film/K+-exchanged OWGs sensing device is <0.4ppm for chlorobenzene gas. The response of sensor was found to be linear in a wide range of chlorobenzene gas concentration. The fabricated OWG sensor showed good operational stability, besides, it is easy to fabricate, fast in response, and reversible. The unique qualities of this sensor such as lower cost, easy implementation and higher sensitivity make it suitable for many applications, including environmental ones and chemical industries. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) are largely used in industry. ",
