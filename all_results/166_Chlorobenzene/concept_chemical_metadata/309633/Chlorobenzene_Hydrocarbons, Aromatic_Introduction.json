    "context": "At high levels of exposure, many VOCs are known to cause toxic effects, whereas low levels have been linked to airway inflammation and alterations in immune cell function, with a subsequent risk for development of allergies and asthma (Diez et al., 2000; Lehmann et al., 2001, 2002). Human exposure to VOC mainly occurs by inhalation of contaminated air; consequently, the lung is the first site for absorption of inhaled agents. Within the airways, lung epithelial cells form a physical barrier to environmental exposure and act as immune effectors by secreting pro-inflammatory mediators in response to diverse stimuli, including xenobiotics (Adler et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2008). Exposure of human lung epithelial cells to the aromatic hydrocarbons styrene or chlorobenzene at indoor relevant concentrations could be correlated with increased amounts of secreted inflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and IL-8 (Fisch\u00e4der et al., 2008; Lehmann et al., 2008; R\u00f6der-Stolinski et al., 2008a,b). MCP-1 is an inevitable factor in recruitment of inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils and monocytes in lung allergic inflammation and other pulmonary disorders (Conti and DiGioacchino, 2001), whereas IL-8 acts as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils (Baggiolini et al., 1995). As we have shown previously using the human lung epithelial cell line A549, oxidative stress and the redox-sensitive NF\u03baB pathway are directly involved in the induction of MCP-1 by styrene or chlorobenzene (R\u00f6der-Stolinski et al., 2008a,b; M\u00f6rbt et al., 2009). Additionally, recent results implicated that expression of several markers for oxidative stress such as glutathione S-transferase \u03c01 (GSTP-1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the key enzyme of prostaglandin pathway, are upregulated in the presence of chlorobenzene (Feltens et al., 2010).

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as an aromatic hydrocarbon that, when inhaled, can lead to inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells. The exposure to chlorobenzene correlates with increased secretion of inflammatory mediators like MCP-1 and IL-8, which are critical in allergic inflammation and pulmonary disorders. This highlights chlorobenzene's role as a specific example of aromatic hydrocarbons that can induce adverse biological effects, particularly in respiratory health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and aromatic hydrocarbons, supported by evidence of chlorobenzene's inflammatory effects in lung cells. The context provides specific details on how chlorobenzene, as an aromatic hydrocarbon, contributes to immune responses, indicating a clear relationship.",
