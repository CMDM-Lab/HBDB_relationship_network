    "context": "The regeneration under air flow at 350\u00b0C for 5h did not allow to remove all the chlorine contained in the used catalyst. Although residual chlorine was still present after the regeneration, the initial activity was almost totally recovered. TG/DT analysis showed that residual chlorine was strongly linked to the solid and that it cannot be eliminated at temperatures lower than 650\u00b0C. On the contrary to toluene oxidation, TG/DTA results also demonstrated that no coke deposit was formed during the oxidation of chlorobenzene. Thermal oxidation of chlorinated hydrocarbons in an incinerator is a common waste-disposal method. Under ideal conditions, chlorinated hydrocarbons oxidize to H2O, CO2 and HCl. The HCl can be removed easily with exhaust gas processing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its thermal oxidation process and the behavior of residual chlorine in a catalyst during regeneration. The text highlights that chlorobenzene does not form coke deposits during oxidation, contrasting it with toluene. The focus is on the chemical properties and reactions of chlorobenzene, particularly in waste disposal methods, indicating its significance in environmental chemistry.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chlorobenzene and its chemical behavior during oxidation processes. The context provides evidence of its properties and reactions, particularly in waste disposal, demonstrating a clear relevance in the study of chlorinated hydrocarbons.",
        "score": 4
