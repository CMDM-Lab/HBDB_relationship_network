    "context": "The second stage is the straight line parallel to the time-axis, which represents the state of thermodynamic equilibrium between the gaseous standard mixture and the sorbent. This stage can be described with the following equation: (1) y=b\u00d7t+a where: y\u2014amount of compound collected in the denuder [a.u.]; t\u2014sorption time [min]; a\u2014intercept [a.u.]; b\u2014slope [a.u./min] After reaching the equilibrium state, \u2018b\u2019 is close to zero and the straight line equation is simplified to the form y=a. Equilibrium amount of an analyte adsorbed under experimental conditions was equal to \u2018a\u2019 expressed in mass units, which was subsequently converted into equilibrium concentration of the analyte in the stationary phase, taking into account the volume of its film. The values of the partition coefficients K fs (K fs=C f/C s, where C f and C s are equilibrium concentrations of an analyte in the stationary phase and in the gas, respectively), were calculated for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene and o-xylene. There are two important, practical aspects of the experimental approach used in the paper: (a) The method utilized is a direct one. Final values of the partition coefficients are obtained exclusively on the basis of GC determined concentrations of analytes in the gas stream after desorption from the stationary phase in the denuder (providing the volume of the stationary phase and the concentration of the initial standard mixture are known). (b) Full concentration vs. sorption time profiles permit to determine another parameter essential in practical applications of the procedure, i.e. the minimum time needed for reaching the state of equilibrium between the two phases.

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both analyzed as components of a gaseous standard mixture in a study focused on their adsorption characteristics. The partition coefficients for these compounds, along with others like benzene and ethylbenzene, are calculated to understand their behavior in a stationary phase during gas chromatography. However, the relationship between chlorobenzene and toluene is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of partition coefficient calculations, indicating they are part of the same study. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between the two compounds.",
