    "context": "The C6 chemistry is the same as for benzene with the following distinctions. Destruction of C6H5Cl is initiated by the same chain branching seen for the benzene case. Grouping the C6 reactions gives two dominant pathways: C 6 H 5 Cl+O 2+OH\u2192H 2 O+C 6 H 4 ClO+O and C 6 H 5 Cl+O\u2192C 6 H 4 ClO+H The first is chain branching and the second is chain propagating. It is these reactions and the equilibrium concentrations of OH in the combustion-products flow that result in efficient destruction of chlorobenzene at low temperatures. Note that most of the rates for the chain-branching, C6-species reactions were taken from literature sources and were not estimated from benzene reaction rates. The majority of the estimated reaction rates were for reactions not containing C6 species. Chlorophenol, C6H4ClOH, was also formed. ",
