    "context": "Carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 3.7 mlmin\u22121, whereas, the detector was fed by means of air (276 mlmin\u22121) and hydrogen (30.3 mlmin\u22121). For a given initial concentration, three samples were analysed at each reaction time. The averages of these 3 analyses were used as data points for fitting the results into regression models. Degradation kinetics of aqueous chlorobenzene solutions Aqueous solutions with initial concentrations of CB of 1, 5, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 3440 \u03bcM were sonicated. Linear regression of the logarithm of concentrations versus reaction time allowed to calculate first-order reaction rate constants. These are presented in Table 1. Additionally, results from previous work with concentrations in the millimolar range are mentioned. ",
