    "context": "For the establishment of the experimental system, chlorobenzene was used as a model compound. Chlorobenzene is one of the most widely used chlorinated benzenes. This compound serves as a solvent for paints, adhesives, waxes, polishes, or dry-cleaning (EPA, 2006; Willhite and Book, 1990; NIOH/NIOSH, 1994). In addition, chlorobenzene is generated as an intermediate product during manufacture of some organic chemicals, dyestuff, resins, perfumes, or insecticides (Willhite and Book, 1990). It has been reported that air levels of chlorobenzene at workplaces varied from not detectable to 18.7mg/m3 in the United States (BUA, 1991). In Japan, chlorobenzene levels at workplaces were found between 7.8 and 26.7mg/m3 (Yoshida et al., 1986), whereas similar reports from Belgium showed variations in chlorobenzene concentrations from 0.2 to 488mg/m3 (Kusters and Lauwerys, 1990). Like other volatile halogenated hydrocarbons, chlorobenzene is also present in the indoor air of, for example, household settings in amounts exceeding those of the ambient air. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as a model compound within the broader category of organic chemicals. It is widely used as a solvent and is also produced as an intermediate in the manufacture of various organic chemicals, dyestuffs, and insecticides. The discussion highlights chlorobenzene's relevance to organic chemicals through its applications and production processes, indicating a significant relationship between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chlorobenzene and organic chemicals, as chlorobenzene is both a widely used organic solvent and an intermediate in the production of other organic compounds. The context provides specific applications and production details that support this relationship.",
        "score": 4
