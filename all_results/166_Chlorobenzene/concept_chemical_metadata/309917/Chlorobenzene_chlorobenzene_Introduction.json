    "context": "In addition, there is evidence from an epidemiological study that exposure to chlorobenzene at concentration levels below 10\u03bcg/m3 can be associated with allergic sensitizations as well as a Th2 primed T cell immunity in children (Lehmann et al., 2001). However, the mechanism of allergy mediating effects of chlorobenzene and other VOC is still unknown. To investigate the inflammatory and immuno-modulatory potential of chlorobenzene, we exposed human lung epithelial cells (cell line A549) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the air/liquid cell culture system. In addition to cytotoxic effects, we analyzed the influence of chlorobenzene on the functional activity of human lung epithelial and peripheral blood cells by determination of released mediators. IL-8 and MCP-1 were selected as relevant functional parameters of the lung epithelial cell line A549, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 as inflammatory markers produced by PBMC. In addition, PBMC-derived release of IFN-\u03b3 (as marker for Th1 cells) and IL-13 (as marker for Th2 cells) was considered. Materials and methods Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7] in a purity \u2a7e99% (GC) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its potential immuno-modulatory and inflammatory effects on human lung epithelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study investigates how exposure to chlorobenzene can influence the release of inflammatory mediators, indicating its relevance in allergic sensitization and immune response, particularly in children. The term is consistently used to refer to the same chemical compound, emphasizing its significance in the research.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between chlorobenzene and its effects on immune responses and inflammation, supported by experimental evidence and specific biological interactions outlined in the study.",
        "score": 5
