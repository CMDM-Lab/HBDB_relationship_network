    "context": "In addition to cytotoxic effects, we analyzed the influence of chlorobenzene on the functional activity of human lung epithelial and peripheral blood cells by determination of released mediators. IL-8 and MCP-1 were selected as relevant functional parameters of the lung epithelial cell line A549, TNF-\u03b1, and MCP-1 as inflammatory markers produced by PBMC. In addition, PBMC-derived release of IFN-\u03b3 (as marker for Th1 cells) and IL-13 (as marker for Th2 cells) was considered. Materials and methods Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7] in a purity \u2a7e99% (GC) was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Prior to application, chlorobenzene was diluted in methanol (Merck) serially. Cellular assays The human adherent lung epithelial cell line A549 (lung carcinoma, ATCC no. CCL-185; LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany) and PBMC were used as indicator cells. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as a specific chemical compound analyzed for its cytotoxic effects and influence on the functional activity of human lung epithelial and peripheral blood cells. It is categorized under 'chemicals' as it is a substance used in the study, but the relationship is primarily focused on its biological effects rather than a broader discussion of chemicals in general.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as chlorobenzene is mentioned as a specific chemical within a broader category of chemicals. However, the context does not elaborate on its relationship with other chemicals or provide a detailed discussion of its significance beyond its individual effects.",
