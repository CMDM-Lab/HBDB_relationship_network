    "context": "Solvents tested were; methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, carbon disulfide, and a mixed solution of 20% carbon disulfide and 80% methanol (CS2/MeOH). Nicotine in the final eluates was analyzed by GC/MS under the same conditions as described above. All solvents tested were able to elute nicotine from the CFP within 30min. The elution efficiency was in the order: CS2/MeOH>methanol>ethyl acetate>carbon disulfide>ethanol>acetonitrile>isopropanol. CS2/MeOH showed the highest elution efficiency. Fig. 2 shows elution efficiencies of nicotine from the CFP using CS2/MeOH, methanol and isopropanol after collection of mainstream cigarette smoke. Generally, isopropanol is used as the solvent for elution of nicotine in several official standard methods such as ISO, HCI and CORESTA recommend methods (CRM). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanedithione and acetonitrile are both mentioned as solvents tested for their ability to elute nicotine from a cigarette filter pad (CFP). However, there is no direct interaction or comparison between the two solvents regarding their effectiveness or properties. They are simply part of a list of solvents evaluated in the study, with acetonitrile showing lower elution efficiency compared to others, but no specific relationship to methanedithione is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as methanedithione and acetonitrile are both included in a list of solvents tested for nicotine elution, but their relationship is not detailed or explored beyond their inclusion in the same context.",
        "score": 2
