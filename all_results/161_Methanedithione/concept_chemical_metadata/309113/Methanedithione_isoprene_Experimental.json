    "context": "A standard 1,3-butadiene solution (2.0mg/mL in methanol) was purchased from AccuStandard Inc. (New Haven, CT, USA). The water used for HPLC and sample preparation was deionized and purified using a Milli-Q Water System equipped with a UV lamp (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Benzene-d6 (99.95%), Isoprene (95.0%), acrylonitrile (97%), benzene (99.7%), toluene (99.7%) and carbon disulfide (99.0%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, LTD. (Osaka, Japan). Carboxen 572 (CX-572, 20/45 mesh), acetonitrile (HPLC grade, >99.9%), ethanol (>99.5), methanol (anhydrous, 99.8%), phosphoric acid (85% solution in water), (\u2212)-nicotine (\u226599%), isoquinolile (97%) and ammonium acetate (99.999%) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Inc.

        "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and isoprene are both mentioned as chemicals purchased from different suppliers, but there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between them. They are part of a broader list of chemicals used in the study, with no specific relevance to each other in terms of function or application.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methanedithione and isoprene are merely listed among other chemicals without any indication of interaction, relevance, or shared function in the context provided.",
