    "context": "Non-polar compounds such as VOCs are eluted by first elution with carbon disulfide and polar compounds such as carbonyls are eluted by second elution with methanol. The cartridge can be used to measure chemicals not only from one single cigarette, but also from the volume of one single puff because of its high sensitivity and simple operation. However, CX-572 method cannot simultaneously measure nicotine, tar, VOCs and carbonyls. Therefore, we developed a new analytical method for simultaneous determination of nicotine, tar, volatile organic compounds and carbonyls in mainstream cigarette smoke using a glass filter and a sorbent cartridge followed by two-phase/one-pot elution with carbon disulfide and methanol. Particulate matter such as nicotine and triacetin are coeluted with gaseous compounds such as VOCs and carbonyls in a one-pot vial. Apparatus and reagents The HPLC system (Prominence LC-20, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used with two LC-20AD pumps, an SIL-20AC autosampler and an SPD M20A photo-diode array detector. The analytical column was an Ascentis RP-Amide, 3\u03bcm particle size, 150mm\u00d73mm i.d. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be categorized under organic chemicals, particularly in the context of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbonyls analyzed in cigarette smoke. The discussion focuses on the analytical methods for measuring various organic chemicals, including nicotine and VOCs, but does not detail the specific role or relationship of Methanedithione within this framework. Thus, while both terms are related through the broader category of organic chemicals, their direct interaction is not established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Methanedithione is implied to be part of the broader category of organic chemicals discussed in the context of cigarette smoke analysis, but there is no specific relationship or interaction detailed.",
