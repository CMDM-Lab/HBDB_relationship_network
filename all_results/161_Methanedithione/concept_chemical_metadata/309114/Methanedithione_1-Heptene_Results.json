    "context": "There was a higher proportion of male patients (16 [80%] vs 5 [26.3%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01) in the EAC group. The disease characteristics of the study population are shown in Table\u00a02 . The levels of the 9 VOCs were significantly reduced in the plasma headspace of patients with EAC compared with those without EAC; these included acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, carbon disulfide, isoprene, 1-heptene, 3-methylhexane, 2-nonene, hydrogen sulfide, and triethylamine (Table\u00a03 , Fig.\u00a01 ). All 9 VOCs remained statistically significant after adjusting for sex, age, and BMI. A receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the 9 differentially expressed VOC concentrations as a diagnostic marker for EAC. A model, as described in the Methods section, was developed that discriminated patients with EAC from patients without EAC by using acrylonitrile and carbon disulfide. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and 1-Heptene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in the plasma headspace of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction; they are simply part of a list of VOCs that were significantly reduced in EAC patients compared to controls. Their individual roles or connections in the context of EAC diagnosis are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Methanedithione and 1-Heptene are both listed as VOCs in the study but lack a detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions within the context of EAC.",
