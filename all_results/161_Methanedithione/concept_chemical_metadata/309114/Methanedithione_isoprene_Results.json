    "context": "There was a higher proportion of male patients (16 [80%] vs 5 [26.3%]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01) in the EAC group. The disease characteristics of the study population are shown in Table\u00a02 . The levels of the 9 VOCs were significantly reduced in the plasma headspace of patients with EAC compared with those without EAC; these included acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, carbon disulfide, isoprene, 1-heptene, 3-methylhexane, 2-nonene, hydrogen sulfide, and triethylamine (Table\u00a03 , Fig.\u00a01 ). All 9 VOCs remained statistically significant after adjusting for sex, age, and BMI. A receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the 9 differentially expressed VOC concentrations as a diagnostic marker for EAC. A model, as described in the Methods section, was developed that discriminated patients with EAC from patients without EAC by using acrylonitrile and carbon disulfide. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in the plasma headspace of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are included in a list of VOCs that were significantly reduced in EAC patients compared to controls. There is no direct interaction or functional relationship highlighted between Methanedithione and isoprene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both Methanedithione and isoprene are part of a broader analysis of VOCs in EAC patients, but their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed in the context.",
