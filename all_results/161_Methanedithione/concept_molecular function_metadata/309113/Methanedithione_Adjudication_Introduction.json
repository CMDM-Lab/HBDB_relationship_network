    "context": "Non-polar compounds such as VOCs are eluted by first elution with carbon disulfide and polar compounds such as carbonyls are eluted by second elution with methanol. The cartridge can be used to measure chemicals not only from one single cigarette, but also from the volume of one single puff because of its high sensitivity and simple operation. However, CX-572 method cannot simultaneously measure nicotine, tar, VOCs and carbonyls. Therefore, we developed a new analytical method for simultaneous determination of nicotine, tar, volatile organic compounds and carbonyls in mainstream cigarette smoke using a glass filter and a sorbent cartridge followed by two-phase/one-pot elution with carbon disulfide and methanol. Particulate matter such as nicotine and triacetin are coeluted with gaseous compounds such as VOCs and carbonyls in a one-pot vial. Apparatus and reagents The HPLC system (Prominence LC-20, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used with two LC-20AD pumps, an SIL-20AC autosampler and an SPD M20A photo-diode array detector. The analytical column was an Ascentis RP-Amide, 3\u03bcm particle size, 150mm\u00d73mm i.d. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and Adjudication are not directly related. Methanedithione is mentioned in the context of analytical methods for measuring volatile organic compounds and carbonyls in cigarette smoke, while adjudication typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. There is no discussion of how these two terms interact or relate to each other within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Methanedithione and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct connection or relevance to each other.",
