    "context": "Twenty milliliters of headspace were removed with a gas syringe and analyzed. The samples were analyzed by using a SIFT-MS on a VOICE200 SIFT-MS instrument (Syft Technologies Ltd, Christchurch, New Zealand). The SIFT-MS instrument has been described and validated previously. 18 Our analysis focused on 22 preselected analytes: 2-propanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, benzene, carbon disulfide, dimethyl sulfide, ethanol, isoprene, pentane, 1-decene, 1-heptene, 1-nonene, 1-octene, 3-methylhexane, 2-nonene, ammonia, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, triethyl amine, and trimethyl amine. Currently, the number of analytes that we can measure precisely from each sample is limited by the sample size and the currently available technology, so we chose to focus our analysis on these analytes because we knew from our previous work that they are commonly present in the headspace of blood samples and that we can measure them reliably. 13,14 At the time of the analysis, each measurement was made in duplicate. The coefficient of variation for each VOC was less than 5%. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione is not explicitly mentioned as one of the analytes being measured. Instead, the focus is on a list of 22 preselected analytes analyzed using SIFT-MS technology. While Methanedithione could potentially be an analyte of interest in other studies, it is not directly related to the analytes discussed here, indicating a lack of specific connection in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methanedithione is not mentioned as an analyte in the analysis, and there is no discussion of its relevance or connection to the analytes listed.",
