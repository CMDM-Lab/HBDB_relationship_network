    "context": "All individual compounds with AUCs of 0.75 or higher were further assessed to find the combination of any 2 that provided the highest AUC; log transformations were assessed to see improvement of model fit. A stepwise selection algorithm was used to determine the most predictive model (highest AUC). We were limited to 2 compounds to build our predictive model because we had 20 events (cancers). 21 The final proposed model for differentiating between EAC and GERD consists of acrylonitrile and carbon disulfide. The final prediction model for EAC was defined as follows: z\u00a0=\u00a00.519\u00a0\u2212 [1.084\u00a0\u00d7 ln(acrylonitrile)]\u00a0\u2212 (0.533\u00a0\u00d7 ln(carbon disulfide)], where ln is the natural logarithm, optimized discrimination of patient with and without EAC. This value (z) was then converted to\u00a0a\u00a0probability distribution score called the headspace EAC with\u00a0a value between 0 and 100 by the following formula: p\u00a0=\u00a0[ez/(1\u00a0+ ez)]\u00a0\u00d7 100. 22 After choosing the\u00a0final model, the method described by Harrell et\u00a0al 20 was used to compute the validation metric\u00a0with overfitting bias correction through bootstrap resampling.

The focus is on developing a predictive model for differentiating between esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and GERD using compounds like acrylonitrile and carbon disulfide. There is no discussion of Methanedithione's role or relevance to GERD, indicating a lack of connection between the two terms.",
