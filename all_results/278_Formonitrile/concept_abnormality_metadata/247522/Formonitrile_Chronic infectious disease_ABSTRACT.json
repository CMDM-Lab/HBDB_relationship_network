    "context": "Guidelines are needed for design and control of TPPBs. [1] Biofilm cultures of Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) infection have been found to generate the nonvolatile cyanide ion. [2] We investigated if gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was a marker of BCC infection. [3] Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry analysis showed HCN was not elevated in the headspace of planktonic or biofilm cultures or in the exhaled breath of adult cystic fibrosis patients with chronic BCC infection. [4] HCN is therefore not an in vitro or in vivo marker of BCC. [1] The volatile compound hydrogen cyanide (HCN) has been shown to be an in vitro marker of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the factors that affect its production have been established . [2] HCN is also an in vivo marker of P. aeruginosa infection when measured in exhaled breath . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to chronic infectious diseases through its association with hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a compound linked to infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the study indicates that HCN is not a reliable marker for BCC infections in cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting limited relevance of Formonitrile in the context of chronic infectious diseases.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Formonitrile and chronic infectious diseases, as they are mentioned in the same context regarding HCN's role in infections, but there is no direct discussion of Formonitrile's impact or relevance to chronic infectious diseases.",
