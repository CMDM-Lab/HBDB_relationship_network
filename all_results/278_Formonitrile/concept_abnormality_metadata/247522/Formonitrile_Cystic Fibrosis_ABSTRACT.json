    "context": "Guidelines are needed for design and control of TPPBs. [1] Biofilm cultures of Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) infection have been found to generate the nonvolatile cyanide ion. [2] We investigated if gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was a marker of BCC infection. [3] Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry analysis showed HCN was not elevated in the headspace of planktonic or biofilm cultures or in the exhaled breath of adult cystic fibrosis patients with chronic BCC infection. [4] HCN is therefore not an in vitro or in vivo marker of BCC. [1] The volatile compound hydrogen cyanide (HCN) has been shown to be an in vitro marker of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the factors that affect its production have been established . [2] HCN is also an in vivo marker of P. aeruginosa infection when measured in exhaled breath . ",

        "summary": "In this context, formonitrile is indirectly related to cystic fibrosis through the investigation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as a potential marker for Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) infections in cystic fibrosis patients. However, the study found that HCN was not elevated in the breath of these patients, indicating that formonitrile's relevance is minimal as it is not directly discussed or linked to cystic fibrosis beyond the context of infection markers.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as formonitrile is mentioned in relation to HCN and BCC infections in cystic fibrosis patients, but there is no direct evidence or significant discussion of its role or impact on cystic fibrosis itself.",
