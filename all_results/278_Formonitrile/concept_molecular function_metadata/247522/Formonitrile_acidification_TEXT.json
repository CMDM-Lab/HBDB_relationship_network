    "context": " [3] This is in contrast to Ryall et al., who observed cyanogenesis in 32 of 34 biofilm BCC cultures .  [4] The reason for this discrepancy is unclear.  [5] They found concentrations of trapped cyanide ranging from 60 \u00ce\u00bcM to 19 mM (equivalent to equilibrium headspace HCN gas concentrations of 7 parts per million by volume [ppmv] to 2,100 ppmv at 20\u00c2\u00b0C) , which would be easily detected using SIFT-MS.  [6] The small increase in the gaseous HCN concentrations produced by acidification of the biofilm BCC cultures suggests some cyanide ions were present.  [7] Despite this, the HCN concentrations remained <10 ppbv, meaning that the scale of the cyanogenesis was minimal compared to that seen by Ryall et al.  [8] The 34 BCC samples (from 9 species) used by Ryall et al. were a mixture of clinical and environmental, whereas we assessed 12 BCC clinical samples from 3 species.  [9] Ryall et al. found that cyanide concentrations varied between species, and so the different origins of the samples and the different species analyzed may have contributed to the discrepancy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to acidification through the production of cyanide in biofilm cultures. The acidification of these cultures appears to influence the concentration of cyanide ions, suggesting that Formonitrile may play a role in cyanogenesis under acidic conditions. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and the overall impact of Formonitrile on acidification is not thoroughly explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Formonitrile and acidification, as they are mentioned in the context of cyanogenesis and cyanide production. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration and direct evidence of interaction.",
