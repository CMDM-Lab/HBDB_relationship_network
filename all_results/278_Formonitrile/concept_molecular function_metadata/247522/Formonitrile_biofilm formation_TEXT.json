    "context": " [9] Planktonic culture conditions were developed by pipetting inoculated BHI broth into a petri dish without glass beads. [10] The dishes were individually sealed and incubated. [11] Control cultures were prepared using the same methodology but with sterile BHI broth. [12] Biofilm formation was assessed visually on a daily basis and quantitatively after 96 h of incubation. [13] For the quantitative assessment, spectrophotometry was undertaken after crystal violet staining using a previously described methodology . [14] For both planktonic and biofilm cultures, the headspace HCN concentration was measured at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of incubation using a previously described methodology . [15] At 96 h, the headspace HCN concentrations were remeasured after acidification of the cultures using 1 ml HCl to promote the generation of gaseous HCN from cyanide ions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is not directly mentioned in relation to biofilm formation. The study focuses on the methodology for assessing biofilm formation and measuring headspace HCN concentrations in cultures. While biofilm formation is quantitatively assessed, there is no indication of how Formonitrile influences or interacts with this process, leading to a lack of direct relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that Formonitrile and biofilm formation are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion or evidence of their relationship. They appear coincidentally without any direct relevance.",
