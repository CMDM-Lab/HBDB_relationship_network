    "context": "[2] We investigated if gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was a marker of BCC infection. [3] Selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry analysis showed HCN was not elevated in the headspace of planktonic or biofilm cultures or in the exhaled breath of adult cystic fibrosis patients with chronic BCC infection. [4] HCN is therefore not an in vitro or in vivo marker of BCC. [1] The volatile compound hydrogen cyanide (HCN) has been shown to be an in vitro marker of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the factors that affect its production have been established . [2] HCN is also an in vivo marker of P. aeruginosa infection when measured in exhaled breath . [3] In children with cystic fibrosis (CF), mouth- or nose-exhaled breath can be used as healthy children have low or undetectable HCN levels . [4] As healthy adults generate HCN in their mouth, only nose-exhaled breath should be used . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is not directly mentioned, but hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a volatile compound, is discussed as a marker for infections, particularly in relation to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cystic fibrosis. While HCN is a volatile substance, the relationship between Formonitrile and volatile substances is not explicitly established, leaving their connection unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Formonitrile and volatile substances relate to the broader category of volatile compounds, but there is no specific discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
