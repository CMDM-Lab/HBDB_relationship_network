    "context": "[1] One possible, minimally invasive procedure is the analysis of trace gases in the breath of CF patients. [2] Sulfides and other trace gases are known to be produced by bacteria , including P. aeruginosa  and B. cepacia , and the relative amounts of these gases seem to be characteristic of species and strain. [3] For these reasons we hypothesized that sulfides might be elevated in the exhaled breath of CF patients. [4] Here we report the results of a pilot study in which we measured concentrations, in the breath of a sample of CF patients and healthy controls, of three sulfides that are known to be produced by bacteria: carbonyl sulfide (OCS), dimethylsulfide (DMS), and carbon disulfide (CS2). [1] Subjects. [2] Twenty CF patients (mean age, 17 years; range, 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 years; 8 females) and 23 healthy control subjects (mean age, 20 years; range, 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c37 years; 9 females) completed participation in the study. [3] The difference in age between the two groups was not statistically significant. ",

        "summary": "In this context, sulfanylidenemethanone and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are both mentioned as trace gases potentially produced by bacteria in the breath of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The study aims to measure concentrations of various sulfides, including DMS, in the breath of CF patients and healthy controls. However, the specific relationship between sulfanylidenemethanone and DMS is not directly explored, as they are listed among other sulfides without detailed interaction or comparison.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the study of sulfides in breath analysis, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
