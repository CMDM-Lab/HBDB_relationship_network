    "context": "When considering toluene exposure in particular, the results of the few studies on CYP2E1 activity and expression actually carried out in a workplace scenario have shown contrasting results. In one study in a population with occupational exposure to several solvents a significant, nearly 50% inhibition of in vivo CYP2E1 enzymatic activity was observed in persons exposed as compared to controls (Lucas et al., 1999), whereas in another work CYP2E1 mRNA content but not CYP2E1 enzymatic activity was found to be increased in exposed persons although with no correlation between toluene exposure level and CYP2E1 activity (Mendoza-Cant\u00fa et al., 2006). Moreover, although tannery workers, according to certain non-government international agencies, are reported to be exposed to VOCs in a specific process on leather, the \u201cfinishing\u201d, to the best of our knowledge there is no report in the literature providing evidence neither of exposure level nor of the kind of chemical mixture actually involved. The present investigation was intended, therefore, to explore the impact on CYP2E1 activity as a result of the occupational exposure to toluene and other VOCs, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene in a group of tannery workers as compared to matched controls. Study participants and ethical issues After agreement with the owners of the plant, the workers of two different tanneries from the city of Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, M\u00e9xico were invited to participate in the study. In this particular workplaces they perform a specific process of tanning, known as the \u201cfinishing\u201d which, according to some international non-profit organizations, is where VOCs are most extensively used (IFC, 2007). Finishing is considered the last part of the tanning process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned alongside toluene as a volatile organic compound (VOC) to be studied for its impact on CYP2E1 activity in tannery workers. The investigation aims to assess how occupational exposure to VOCs, including ethylbenzene, affects CYP2E1 gene expression and enzymatic activity. While the study highlights the relevance of CYP2E1 in metabolizing VOCs, it does not provide specific data on ethylbenzene's direct effects, focusing instead on the broader implications of VOC exposure on CYP2E1 activity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is included in the study of CYP2E1 activity related to VOC exposure. However, the context does not provide detailed evidence of ethylbenzene's specific impact on CYP2E1, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
        "score": 3
