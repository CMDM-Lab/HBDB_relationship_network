    "context": "Specificities and sensitivities for the reported cut offs varied between 59.2% and 85.5%. Adults were reported to have higher unadjusted levels of every VOC than females. Hispanic had lower levels of every VOC than both non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. The ratios of unadjusted levels for smokers as compared to nonsmokers were 5.4, 3.5, 2.7, 2.3, 1.9 and 1.5 for benzene, toluene, styrene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. While NHANES data for blood VOCs for 2005\u20132006 were released in December 2011, data for 2007\u20132008 for blood VOCs were not released until May 2016 and for 2009\u20132012 until April 2017. However, since data for serum cotinine for 2013\u20132014 necessary to define smoking status have not been released, a trend analysis for this study was limited to using 2005\u20132012 data or for a period of 8 years. This larger dataset provides an opportunity to explore whether risk factors associated with elevated VOC exposures differ in subgroups of U.S. adults as suggested by Symanski et al. (2009). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose levels were analyzed in relation to various demographic factors, including smoking status. However, the context does not provide specific details about their interaction or comparative significance, merely noting their presence in the dataset without a direct relationship or functional connection between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both included in the analysis of VOC levels but are not discussed in terms of their interaction or specific relationship within the context.",
