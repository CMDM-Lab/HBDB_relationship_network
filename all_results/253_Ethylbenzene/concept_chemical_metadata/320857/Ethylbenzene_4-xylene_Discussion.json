    "context": "While Symanski et al. (2009) did not present data on associations between having a private well and the levels of VOC, in this study, no association was observed between the levels of any VOC and having a private well among adults but among adolescents, having a private well was associated with increased levels of STY. Pumping gasoline was found to be associated with higher levels of TOL, ethylbenzene, and xylenes by Symanski et al. (2009). In this study also, pumping gas into a motor vehicle during the last three days was also associated with higher levels of benzene, o-xylene, TOL, and m/p-xylene. Spending time near a smoker for >10min or exposure to second hand smoke was associated with higher levels of benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, STY, TOL, and m/p-xylene among adults aged >=20year. Using paint thinners, brush cleaners, and strippers were associated with higher levels of xylenes among those aged 20\u201359 years (Symanski et al., 2009). In this study breathing fumes from paints and degreasing cleaners was associated with higher levels of benzene, breathing fumes from paints, degreasing cleaners, and paint thinners was associated with higher levels of o-xylene, breathing fumes from paints or fingernail polish and removers was associated with increased levels of TOL, and breathing fumes from paints and paint thinners was associated with increased levels of m/p-xylene among adults aged >=20 years. Without doubt, adjusted levels of benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, and m/p-xylene have decreases over the study period of 2005\u20132012 and smokers do have several fold higher levels of these VOCs when compared with nonsmokers.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with exposure from activities such as pumping gasoline and using paint thinners. The study indicates that these compounds can be elevated in individuals exposed to specific environmental factors, but it does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their common association with VOC exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene, as both are identified as VOCs linked to similar exposure scenarios. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other in the context provided.",
