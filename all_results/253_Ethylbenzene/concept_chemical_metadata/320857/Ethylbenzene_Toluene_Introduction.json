    "context": "Specificities and sensitivities for the reported cut offs varied between 59.2% and 85.5%. Adults were reported to have higher unadjusted levels of every VOC than females. Hispanic had lower levels of every VOC than both non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. The ratios of unadjusted levels for smokers as compared to nonsmokers were 5.4, 3.5, 2.7, 2.3, 1.9 and 1.5 for benzene, toluene, styrene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. While NHANES data for blood VOCs for 2005\u20132006 were released in December 2011, data for 2007\u20132008 for blood VOCs were not released until May 2016 and for 2009\u20132012 until April 2017. However, since data for serum cotinine for 2013\u20132014 necessary to define smoking status have not been released, a trend analysis for this study was limited to using 2005\u20132012 data or for a period of 8 years. This larger dataset provides an opportunity to explore whether risk factors associated with elevated VOC exposures differ in subgroups of U.S. adults as suggested by Symanski et al. (2009). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with reported levels in adults. The data indicates that smokers have significantly higher levels of these VOCs compared to nonsmokers, suggesting a potential relationship in exposure patterns. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparative analysis between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs and their association with smoking status.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as VOCs with shared exposure trends among different demographic groups, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interaction.",
