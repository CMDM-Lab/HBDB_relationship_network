    "context": "However, since data for serum cotinine for 2013\u20132014 necessary to define smoking status have not been released, a trend analysis for this study was limited to using 2005\u20132012 data or for a period of 8 years. This larger dataset provides an opportunity to explore whether risk factors associated with elevated VOC exposures differ in subgroups of U.S. adults as suggested by Symanski et al. (2009). Thus, the objectives of this study were to (i) study variability in detection rates of seven VOCs as listed before, (ii) to study trends over 2005\u20132012 in observed levels of these seven VOCs and (iii) to assess factors like gender and race/ethnicity that may affect the observed levels of these seven VOCs in blood. For US participants aged >=12 years, data on seven VOCs, namely, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, styrene (STY), toluene (TOL), and m/p-xylene, in whole blood and associated questionnaires along with data on demographics, body measures, serum cotinine, and fasting time were downloaded from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the period 2005\u20132012 and match merged. Two databases were generated, one for those aged 12\u201319 years and one for those aged >=20 years. Unweighted sample sizes for each of the seven VOCs by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and smoking status are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Nonsmokers were defined as those who had their serum cotinine levels<10ng/mL and smokers were defined as those who had their serum cotinine levels >=10ng/mL. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a study analyzing the variability in detection rates of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in blood samples from U.S. adults. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not explicitly discussed, and they are primarily included in a list of VOCs being studied for trends and demographic factors affecting their levels. There is no direct interaction or functional relationship highlighted between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both included in the same study of VOCs but without any detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions. They share a general category as VOCs but lack specific connections.",
        "score": 2
