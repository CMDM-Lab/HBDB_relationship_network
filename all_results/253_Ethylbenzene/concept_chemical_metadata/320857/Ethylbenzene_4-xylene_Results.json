    "context": "Breathing fumes from paint thinner was associated with increased levels of m/p-xylene (\u03b2=0.15145, p=0.01, supplementary Table S7). Levels of 1, 4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, TOL and m/p-xylene decreased over time (p<=0.03). Percentage decrease in the levels of 1, 4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, STY, TOL, and m/p-xylene was 15.2%, 21.4%, 19.3%, 16.1%, 47.8%, and 17.7% respectively for every two year survey period. Detection rates Among adolescents, there was a substantial decrease in detection rates for benzene from 50.8% in 2005\u20132006 to 15.8% in 2011\u20132012, for ethylbenzene from 68.5% in 2005\u20132006 to 24.3% in 2011\u20132012, and for o-xylene from 69.6% in 2005\u20132006 to 30.7% in 2011\u20132012 indicating significantly decreasing levels over 2005\u20132012. Among adults also, there was a substantial decrease in detection rates for benzene from 54.7% in 2005\u20132006 to 28.6% in 2011\u20132012, for ethylbenzene from 74.5% in 2005\u20132006 to 31.6% in 2011\u20132012, and for o-xylene from 78.4% in 2005\u20132006 to 38.6% in 2011\u20132012 indicating significantly decreasing levels over 2005\u20132012. While detection rates have gone down for both adolescents and adults, adults still have higher detection rates than adolescents indicating higher frequency and levels of exposure among adults.Time trends Using unadjusted analysis, for adolescents, for every two-year survey period, percentage decrease in the levels of benzene, was found to be 22.3% for benzene, 19.3% for ethylbenzene, 17% for o-xylene, 46% for TOL, and 18% for m/p-xylene.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene (specifically m/p-xylene) are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose detection rates have significantly decreased over time among adolescents and adults. The data indicates a trend of reduced exposure to these compounds, suggesting a potential relationship in terms of environmental monitoring and public health, but does not detail any direct interaction or specific functional relationship between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene, as both are VOCs with decreasing detection rates over time. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or shared significance beyond their classification as pollutants.",
