    "context": "However, since data for serum cotinine for 2013\u20132014 necessary to define smoking status have not been released, a trend analysis for this study was limited to using 2005\u20132012 data or for a period of 8 years. This larger dataset provides an opportunity to explore whether risk factors associated with elevated VOC exposures differ in subgroups of U.S. adults as suggested by Symanski et al. (2009). Thus, the objectives of this study were to (i) study variability in detection rates of seven VOCs as listed before, (ii) to study trends over 2005\u20132012 in observed levels of these seven VOCs and (iii) to assess factors like gender and race/ethnicity that may affect the observed levels of these seven VOCs in blood. For US participants aged >=12 years, data on seven VOCs, namely, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, benzene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, styrene (STY), toluene (TOL), and m/p-xylene, in whole blood and associated questionnaires along with data on demographics, body measures, serum cotinine, and fasting time were downloaded from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the period 2005\u20132012 and match merged. Two databases were generated, one for those aged 12\u201319 years and one for those aged >=20 years. Unweighted sample sizes for each of the seven VOCs by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and smoking status are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Nonsmokers were defined as those who had their serum cotinine levels<10ng/mL and smokers were defined as those who had their serum cotinine levels >=10ng/mL. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in a study examining their detection rates and trends in blood levels among U.S. adults from 2005 to 2012. While they are part of the same group of VOCs being studied, the context does not provide specific details about their interactions or comparative significance, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both included in the analysis of VOCs but lack a detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships within the study.",
