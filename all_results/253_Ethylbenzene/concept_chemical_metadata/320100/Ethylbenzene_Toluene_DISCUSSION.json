    "context": "[3] However, it should be noted that in our study, airway acidity was related to different pollutants, namely PM10, NO2, benzene and ethylbenzene, suggesting a link between airways inflammation. [1] The spirometric findings for PM10 and NO2 are not in agreement with the negative associations found for wheezing in the previous months. [2] This could to be in accordance with a previous study [] where increasing exposure to PM10 was associated with reduction in peak expiratory flow, but not with wheezing or dyspnoea. [1] Benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene were the VOCs associated with lung function deterioration and airway inflammation. [2] Toluene is a known cause of occupational asthma [], where exposure to higher levels is common. [3] Low levels of VOCs seem to increase the risk of childhood [] and adult [] asthma symptoms but associations with lung function have been more difficult to find []. [4] Ethylbenzene has also been suggested as a significant risk factor for asthma [], a fact that is in accordance with the airways changes found in our study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with lung function deterioration and airway inflammation. The study highlights toluene's role as a known cause of occupational asthma, while ethylbenzene is suggested as a significant risk factor for asthma. Both compounds are implicated in respiratory health issues, indicating a shared relevance in the context of airway inflammation and asthma risk.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are linked to respiratory health issues and asthma. The context provides evidence of their roles as pollutants affecting lung function, indicating a clear relationship supported by the findings.",
        "score": 4
