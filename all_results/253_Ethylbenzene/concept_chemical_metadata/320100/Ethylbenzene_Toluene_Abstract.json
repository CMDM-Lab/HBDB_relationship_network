    "context": "[1] Respiratory status was assessed four times (January 2006, June 2006, January 2007 and June 2007) during a 1-week period through a standardised questionnaire, spirometry, exhaled nitric oxide fraction and pH in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). [2] Concentrations of particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00c2\u00b5m (PM10), O3, NO2 and volatile organic compounds were estimated through direct measurements with an ad hoc device or air pollution modelling in the children's schools and at their homes in the same 4 weeks of the study. [3] For each child, total exposure to the different air pollutants was estimated as a function of pollutant concentrations and daily activity patterns. [1] Increasing total exposure to PM10, NO2, benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene was significantly associated with a decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and with an increase of change in FEV1. [2] Increasing exposure to NO2 and benzene was also related to a significant decrease of FEV1/forced vital capacity. [3] Increasing exposure to PM10, NO2, benzene and ethylbenzene was associated with acidity of EBC. [1] Various cross-sectional [\u00e2\u20ac\u201c] and longitudinal [\u00e2\u20ac\u201c] studies have shown the effects of both indoor and outdoor air pollutants on the respiratory health of children.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to air pollution and are associated with respiratory health impacts in children. The study indicates that increased exposure to these compounds correlates with decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV1), suggesting a detrimental effect on lung function. Their relationship is highlighted through their shared role as pollutants affecting respiratory outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are linked to adverse respiratory health effects in children. The context provides evidence of their association with decreased lung function, indicating a clear relationship within the study's findings.",
        "score": 4
