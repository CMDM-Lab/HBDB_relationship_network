    "context": "[6] An RTube (Respiratory Research Inc., Austin, TX, USA) was used for EBC collection. [7] 3) Wheezing symptoms, use of rescue medication (bronchodilators such as salbutamol or terbutaline) and emergency department visits in the previous 6 months constituted the clinical outcomes. [1] Air quality assessment took place in the town of Viseu during the four previously mentioned periods. [2] The measured outdoor parameters included ambient air concentrations of O3, NO, NO2, CO and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), and particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u00c2\u00b5m and 2.5 \u00ce\u00bcm (PM10 and PM2.5, respectively), which were measured continuously in three mobile laboratories: in the city centre, the school courtyard of the urban location and a suburban school courtyard. [3] Additionally, at the urban school, both ambient PM10 and PM2.5 were measured by gravimetric methods (24-h mean) while for the suburban school only PM10 was measured, as only one set of equipment for PM2.5 was available. [4] O3 and NO2 concentrations were also measured using diffusive samplers located at 20 points throughout the city of Viseu, in an area of \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc40 km2. [1] Volatile organic compound (VOC; such as formaldehyde and BTEX), O3 and NO2 measurements were performed in the four schools (courtyard and classrooms) and children's houses (bedrooms) using diffusive samplers.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), which are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the air quality assessment in Viseu. They are mentioned together as part of a broader analysis of air pollutants, but no specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together under the category of BTEX in the context of air quality assessment. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
