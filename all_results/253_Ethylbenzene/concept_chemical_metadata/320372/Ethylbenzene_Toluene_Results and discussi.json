    "context": "Fig. 4 shows that concentrations in the polymer phase are much higher than the aqueous phase concentrations, as expected. For all step changes, the trends for individual BTEX components in the polymer phase are similar to those observed in the aqueous phase. An exception to this can be seen for the step change of 6\u00d7, wherein benzene has the lowest polymer phase concentration (Fig. 4c), but the highest aqueous phase concentration (Fig. 3c). This, however, is expected, as partition coefficients that were measured during the polymer phase selection process for silicone rubber revealed that BTEX components have partition coefficients (mgL\u22121 gas phase L mg\u22121 liquid phase) in the following order: ethylbenzene (593\u00b15)> o-xylene (414\u00b12)>toluene (200\u00b14)>benzene (62\u00b12) and thus, as benzene concentrations in the aqueous phase are not exceptionally higher than the other BTEX compounds, benzene concentrations in the polymer phase are expected to be lower than the other BTEX compounds. An important point shown by Fig. 4 is that polymers appear to effectively buffer large concentrations of BTEX compounds in a solid\u2013liquid TPPB. This is the first study to monitor polymer phase concentrations during transient loadings applied to a TPPB to reveal conclusively that uptake by polymers is responsible for the increased performance of a solid\u2013liquid TPPB relative to a single phase reactor. With the polymer phase composing only 10% of the total working volume of the reactor, the polymer beads accounted for 93%, 91% and 70% of the total BTEX present in the working volume for step changes of 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7 and 6\u00d7, respectively (at t =237min).System comparison and limitations There is difficulty in comparing the system in the present work (well mixed) to biofiltration methods (plug flow) as the responsiveness of these systems are dissimilar and the step changes tested on biofilters are typically longer.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of the BTEX group, which are analyzed for their partitioning behavior in a polymer phase versus an aqueous phase. The study highlights that ethylbenzene has a higher partition coefficient compared to toluene, indicating that it is more effectively retained in the polymer phase. This suggests a comparative relationship in their behavior during the study, although the focus is primarily on their individual properties rather than a direct interaction between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in the context of their partitioning behavior in a polymer phase, indicating a comparative relationship. However, the context does not delve deeply into their interactions or shared significance beyond their individual properties.",
