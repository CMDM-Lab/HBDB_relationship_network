[1] In conclusion, high-intensity roadside running, although of short duration, has the potential to expose runners to relatively high amounts of BTEX mass which can be observed in increased blood concentrations. [2] This may have health implications for runners who regularly exercise near roadways. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene, collectively known as BTEX, are volatile compounds that are commonly used in many sectors of the petroleum industry and are often emitted in gaseous waste streams. Traditionally, physical or chemical treatment methods have been used in order to stay within regulation emission guidelines (Khan and Ghoshal, 2000), however, biofilters, which provide a low-cost, energy efficient and effective alternative to the destruction of toxic volatile chemicals (Datta and Allen, 2005), have been shown to be successful in treating low concentrations (less than 5gm\u22123) of BTEX components in gaseous waste streams (Oh and Bartha, 1997; Torkian et al., 2003). Although biofilters are effective for the treatment of low concentrations of contaminants, there has been recent interest in biological BTEX treatment beyond the current abilities of biofilters; that is, the biological treatment of high and fluctuating loadings of BTEX (Jutras et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 2001). Two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) have recently been shown to be extremely effective for the treatment of high and fluctuating loadings of contaminants in waste gas streams (Van Groenestijn and Lake, 1999; Djeribi et al., 2005; Nielsen et al., 2005a; Boudreau and Daugulis, 2006; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2006).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile compounds in the BTEX group, which are commonly associated with the petroleum industry. The text discusses the emissions of BTEX compounds, including ethylbenzene, from petroleum-related activities and their potential health implications for individuals exposed to these compounds, particularly in roadside environments. This highlights the direct relationship between ethylbenzene and petroleum as a source of exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as a component of BTEX, which are volatile compounds emitted during petroleum activities. The context provides evidence of their association and potential health implications.",
