    "context": "[7] This is in stark contrast to benzene with a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm and classification as a carcinogen in humans. [1] In conclusion, high-intensity roadside running, although of short duration, has the potential to expose runners to relatively high amounts of BTEX mass which can be observed in increased blood concentrations. [2] This may have health implications for runners who regularly exercise near roadways. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene, collectively known as BTEX, are volatile compounds that are commonly used in many sectors of the petroleum industry and are often emitted in gaseous waste streams. Traditionally, physical or chemical treatment methods have been used in order to stay within regulation emission guidelines (Khan and Ghoshal, 2000), however, biofilters, which provide a low-cost, energy efficient and effective alternative to the destruction of toxic volatile chemicals (Datta and Allen, 2005), have been shown to be successful in treating low concentrations (less than 5gm\u22123) of BTEX components in gaseous waste streams (Oh and Bartha, 1997; Torkian et al., 2003). Although biofilters are effective for the treatment of low concentrations of contaminants, there has been recent interest in biological BTEX treatment beyond the current abilities of biofilters; that is, the biological treatment of high and fluctuating loadings of BTEX (Jutras et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 2001). Two-phase partitioning bioreactors (TPPBs) have recently been shown to be extremely effective for the treatment of high and fluctuating loadings of contaminants in waste gas streams (Van Groenestijn and Lake, 1999; Djeribi et al., 2005; Nielsen et al., 2005a; Boudreau and Daugulis, 2006; Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2006).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which consists of volatile organic compounds commonly emitted in the petroleum industry. The discussion highlights their collective presence in gaseous waste streams and the health implications for individuals exposed to these compounds, particularly runners near roadways. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not explored in detail beyond their classification as part of the same group of contaminants.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together as part of the BTEX group, indicating a shared context in terms of exposure and health implications, but lacking a specific interaction or detailed relationship between the two compounds.",
