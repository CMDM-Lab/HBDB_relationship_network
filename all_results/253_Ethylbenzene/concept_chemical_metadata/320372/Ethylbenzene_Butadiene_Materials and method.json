    "context": "Benzene (99% assay) and o-xylene (98%, HPLC grade) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, and toluene and ethylbenzene were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) for inoculum preparation was obtained from DIFCO (Canada).Polymer selection In order to select an appropriate polymer for the uptake and release of BTEX in a TPPB, a variety of polymers with different properties was tested for BTEX diffusivity, BTEX polymer/aqueous partitioning and bioavailability. The methods for these tests are described elsewhere (Amsden et al., 2003; Prpich and Daugulis, 2004). The polymers tested include; nylon 6,6 (Zytel 42-A\u00ae, Dupont), ethylene vinyl acetate (ELVAX 360\u00ae, Dupont), styrene\u2013butadiene copolymer (Scientific Polymer Products Inc.), silicone rubber (GE-Mastercraft), poly(butylene terephthalate) (Hytrel 8206\u00ae, Dupont) and polyurethane elastomer (Desmopan 9370A\u00ae, Bayer Materials Science). On the basis of the aforementioned criteria, it was found that silicone rubber was the most favourable polymer for use in the TPPB.Bacterial consortium enrichment A bacterial consortium to metabolize BTEX components was enriched from petroleum contaminated soil (Sarnia, Ontario) and a commercial mixture of petroleum hydrocarbon metabolizing bacteria composed of strains of Pseudomonas (Petrox-1, CL Solutions). The enrichment was completed by adding 0.5g of both the contaminated soil and the commercial mixture to a 1.5L bioreactor with a 1L working volume consisting of medium with the following composition (gL\u22121); 7 (NH4)2SO4, 0.75 MgSO4 \u00b77H2O, 6.6 K2HPO4, 8.42 KH2PO4, and 1mLL\u22121 trace elements. Trace element solution was prepared as follows (gL\u22121): 16.2 FeCl3 \u00b76H2O, 9.44 CaHPO4, 0.15 CuSO4 \u00b75H2O, and 40 citric acid (Davidson and Daugulis, 2003). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and butadiene are both mentioned as components of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene) in relation to polymer selection for uptake and release in a bioreactor system. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their inclusion in the broader category of BTEX compounds. The focus is primarily on the polymers tested for their ability to interact with these compounds rather than on ethylbenzene and butadiene themselves.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and butadiene are both part of the BTEX group mentioned in the context, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating only a general connection without specific interactions or significance.",
        "score": 2
