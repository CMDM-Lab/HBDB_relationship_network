    "context": "Both the aqueous samples and polymer/aqueous samples in the amber bottles were permitted to equilibrate for 24h at 30\u00b0C and the headspace from each bottle was sampled and measured using GC/FID. Concentrations of BTEX in the aqueous phase of the bioreactor were determined using Eq. (1). (1) S i ,R,aq = S i ,g,aq V g,aq + S i ,g,aq H i V L,aq V L,aq where Si ,R,aq is the concentration of species i (one of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or o-xylene) in the aqueous phase of the bioreactor (gm\u22123), Si ,g,aq is the concentration of species i in the gas phase at equilibrium in the glass bottle containing the aqueous phase sample (gm\u22123), Hi is the Henry\u2019s constant for species i (mgL\u22121 gas phase L mg\u22121 liquid phase), V g,aq is the volume of headspace in the glass bottle containing the aqueous phase sample (m3), and V L,aq is the volume of the aqueous phase sample extracted from the bioreactor (m3).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of the BTEX group, which refers to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. The study focuses on measuring their concentrations in different phases (aqueous and polymer) within a bioreactor system. While they are analyzed together, the context does not provide specific interactions or functional relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the same analytical framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of BTEX analysis, indicating they share a general category but lack detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships.",
