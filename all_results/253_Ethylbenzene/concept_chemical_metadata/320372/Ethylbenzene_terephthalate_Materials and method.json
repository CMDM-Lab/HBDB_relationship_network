    "context": "Benzene (99% assay) and o-xylene (98%, HPLC grade) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich, and toluene and ethylbenzene were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) for inoculum preparation was obtained from DIFCO (Canada).Polymer selection In order to select an appropriate polymer for the uptake and release of BTEX in a TPPB, a variety of polymers with different properties was tested for BTEX diffusivity, BTEX polymer/aqueous partitioning and bioavailability. The methods for these tests are described elsewhere (Amsden et al., 2003; Prpich and Daugulis, 2004). The polymers tested include; nylon 6,6 (Zytel 42-A\u00ae, Dupont), ethylene vinyl acetate (ELVAX 360\u00ae, Dupont), styrene\u2013butadiene copolymer (Scientific Polymer Products Inc.), silicone rubber (GE-Mastercraft), poly(butylene terephthalate) (Hytrel 8206\u00ae, Dupont) and polyurethane elastomer (Desmopan 9370A\u00ae, Bayer Materials Science). On the basis of the aforementioned criteria, it was found that silicone rubber was the most favourable polymer for use in the TPPB.Bacterial consortium enrichment A bacterial consortium to metabolize BTEX components was enriched from petroleum contaminated soil (Sarnia, Ontario) and a commercial mixture of petroleum hydrocarbon metabolizing bacteria composed of strains of Pseudomonas (Petrox-1, CL Solutions). The enrichment was completed by adding 0.5g of both the contaminated soil and the commercial mixture to a 1.5L bioreactor with a 1L working volume consisting of medium with the following composition (gL\u22121); 7 (NH4)2SO4, 0.75 MgSO4 \u00b77H2O, 6.6 K2HPO4, 8.42 KH2PO4, and 1mLL\u22121 trace elements. Trace element solution was prepared as follows (gL\u22121): 16.2 FeCl3 \u00b76H2O, 9.44 CaHPO4, 0.15 CuSO4 \u00b75H2O, and 40 citric acid (Davidson and Daugulis, 2003). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and terephthalate are mentioned in relation to the selection of polymers for the uptake and release of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) in a bioreactor system. Poly(butylene terephthalate) is one of the polymers tested for its properties in this application. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and terephthalate beyond their inclusion in the polymer selection process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and terephthalate are connected through the context of polymer selection for BTEX but lack a detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond this general association.",
        "score": 2
