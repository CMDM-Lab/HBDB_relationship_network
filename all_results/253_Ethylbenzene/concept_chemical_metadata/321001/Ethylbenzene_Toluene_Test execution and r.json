    "context": "The results of these analyses are presented in Table 2 . In AS-1, no VOCs were detected above target cleanup levels before or after testing. This indicates that the sparge point was located beneath the contaminated zone, which is recommended for sparging applications. Groundwater collected from GMP-2 showed contaminant reductions for each of the benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) compounds during testing. Concentrations of TCE showed a reduction at the test midpoint but rebounded at the test end. In GMP-4, each of the BTEX compounds appears to have experienced some reduction during testing but rebounded following testing. An explanation for this may be the influx of groundwater from the surrounding area at GMP-4. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) compounds analyzed in groundwater testing. The results indicate that both compounds experienced reductions in concentration during the testing process, suggesting they are part of the same group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being monitored for contamination levels. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the BTEX group.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as VOCs in the context of groundwater testing, but their relationship is not explored in detail, indicating a shared category rather than a direct interaction.",
