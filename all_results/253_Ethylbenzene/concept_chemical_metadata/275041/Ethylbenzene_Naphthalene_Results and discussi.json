    "context": "The maximum specific growth rates estimated are close to those found in the literature for BTEX degradation by a bacterial consortium (Reardon et\u00a0al., 2000; Kermanshahi et\u00a0al., 2006; Littlejohns and Daugulis, 2008; Littlejohns et\u00a0al., 2010). Estimated half-saturation constants for benzene, toluene and p-xylene are quite close to the expected range, while K S,z for ethylbenzene is slightly higher than the value found in previous studies (Littlejohns and Daugulis, 2008). Endogenous respiration rate coefficients (b z ) identified with the BOD-metric test without substrate are rather lower than the commonly reported value of 0.24\u00a0d\u22121 for ordinary heterotrophic organisms at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. Estimated biomass growth yields on benzene, toluene and naphthalene are comparable to conventional values for OHO growth, but are slightly higher for ethylbenzene and p-xylene growth yields in comparison to those determined by Collins and Daugulis (1999). Finally, NAP biodegradation pseudo-first-order kinetic and biomass decay coefficient values estimated are similar to those found in a previous study focusing on NAP (Guha et\u00a0al., 1999).Validation of integrated model A set of kinetic parameter values was obtained on the basis of both experimental measurements and values reported in the literature. Volatilization parameters and biodegradation kinetic coefficients estimated with decoupled experiments are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Table 4 lists the kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients used to implement the dynamic model and the values from the literature. Values of parameters for OHO which have been identified in our system are in the range of those found in the literature and allow a good description of the Oxygen Uptake Rate measured in the SBR. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and naphthalene are both mentioned as compounds involved in biodegradation studies by a bacterial consortium. The text discusses kinetic parameters and growth yields associated with the degradation of these compounds, indicating that both are relevant to the study of microbial degradation processes. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not elaborated upon, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and naphthalene are part of the same biodegradation study, indicating they are related in the context of microbial degradation. However, the lack of detailed interaction or comparison limits the strength of their relationship.",
