    "context": "COD measurements complied with the AFNOR NFT 90-101 standard. MLSS and MLVSS were characterized following, AFNOR 90-105 and AFNOR 90-029 standards respectively. Naphthalene (NAP) was purchased from Aldrich. Benzene (B), toluene (T), ethylbenzene (E), p-xylene (X), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 3,5-dimethylphenol (DMP), methanol, ethanol and acetate were all purchased from Sigma (more than 99% purity). The aromatic compounds concentrations in the liquid phase were evaluated by HS-GC\u2013MS. In the GC\u2013MS method, helium was used as a carrier gas at a column flow rate of 1.2\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u22121. The injection port temperature was 250\u00a0\u00b0C and 1\u00a0mL of gas was injected in split mode (with a ratio of 1:20) for samples having concentrations greater than 1\u00a0ppm. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dichlorophenol are both mentioned as aromatic compounds purchased for a study, but there is no indication of any direct interaction or relationship between them. They are included in a list of chemicals used for evaluating concentrations in a liquid phase, without further discussion of their chemical properties or biological significance in relation to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as ethylbenzene and dichlorophenol are merely listed together as purchased chemicals without any functional or chemical interaction discussed in the context.",
