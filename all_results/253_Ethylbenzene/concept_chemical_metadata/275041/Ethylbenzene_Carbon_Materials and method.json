    "context": "The bioreactor was initially seeded with activated sludge taken from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant and was then operated for 107 days. The reactor was operated in cycles of 6\u00a0h including influent filling (10\u00a0min), reaction (305\u00a0min), settling (30\u00a0min) and effluent withdrawal (15\u00a0min) with a hydraulic retention time of 1.25 days and an imposed sludge retention time of 10\u201317.6 days (depending on the operating phases) (Yin et\u00a0al., 2010). The reactor was fed with a synthetic organic substrate whose composition was based on industrial wastewater treatment plant. It included a readily biodegradable carbon source (49% of the inlet COD: methanol, ethanol and acetate) and the target compounds (51% of the inlet COD: benzene (B), toluene (T), ethylbenzene (E), p-xylene (X), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 3,5-dimethylphenol (DMP) and naphthalene (NAP)). A C:N:P ratio of 100:5:1 was applied and the volumetric loading rate ranged from 2.11 to 2.21\u00a0kg COD\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0d\u22121 depending on the operating phases (three different periods). The first period of acclimatization took place from day 0 to day 41, where no DCP or DMP were added in the feeding solution and the target aromatic compound concentrations were as follows (in mgCOD\u00a0L\u22121): B: 461, T: 473, E: 190, X: 190, NAP: 46. For the second period, an inhibition by DCP was provoked (by DCP addition in the feed wastewater). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is part of a synthetic organic substrate used in a bioreactor for treating petrochemical wastewater. The substrate includes a readily biodegradable carbon source, which is essential for microbial metabolism. Ethylbenzene, along with other aromatic compounds, contributes to the overall carbon content in the influent, indicating its role as a carbon source for microbial degradation processes in the bioreactor.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is included in the substrate composition that provides carbon for microbial activity in the bioreactor. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its role as a carbon source among other compounds.",
        "score": 3
