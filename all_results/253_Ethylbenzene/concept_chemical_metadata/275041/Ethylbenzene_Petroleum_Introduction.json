    "context": "[2] List of genes and primer combinations used in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays of gene expression. Hazardous xenobiotic organic compounds are introduced into the environment via wastewaters generated by human activities and industry. As a result of new legislation (Water Framework Directive, 2000), increased attention is being paid to the fate and mass balance of a number of dangerous pollutants during the conventional activated sludge treatment process. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene (BTEX) or volatile Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as naphthalene are commonly emitted into the environment due to their ubiquitous presence in fuel and petroleum products (Melcer, 1994). These xenobiotic compounds figure on the priority substances list established by the European Water Framework Directive because of their hazardous properties for the environment and their CMR (Cancer, Mutation and Reproduction) properties (An, 2004; Luch, 2005; Farhadian et\u00a0al., 2008). The aerobic biological process is one of the best technologies available for treating industrial wastewaters. Bioremediation is an efficient tool for transforming the compounds to less hazardous or non-hazardous forms with less input of chemicals, energy and time (Ward et\u00a0al., 2003). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that is commonly emitted into the environment due to its presence in petroleum products. The discussion highlights the environmental hazards posed by VOCs, including ethylbenzene, which are prioritized for regulation under the European Water Framework Directive due to their toxic properties. This establishes a direct link between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as the latter is a significant source of the former.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as a VOC emitted from petroleum products. The context discusses the environmental impact and regulatory focus on these compounds, indicating a clear relationship.",
        "score": 4
