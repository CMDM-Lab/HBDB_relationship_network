    "context": "The bioreactor was initially seeded with activated sludge taken from a petrochemical wastewater treatment plant and was then operated for 107 days. The reactor was operated in cycles of 6\u00a0h including influent filling (10\u00a0min), reaction (305\u00a0min), settling (30\u00a0min) and effluent withdrawal (15\u00a0min) with a hydraulic retention time of 1.25 days and an imposed sludge retention time of 10\u201317.6 days (depending on the operating phases) (Yin et\u00a0al., 2010). The reactor was fed with a synthetic organic substrate whose composition was based on industrial wastewater treatment plant. It included a readily biodegradable carbon source (49% of the inlet COD: methanol, ethanol and acetate) and the target compounds (51% of the inlet COD: benzene (B), toluene (T), ethylbenzene (E), p-xylene (X), 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 3,5-dimethylphenol (DMP) and naphthalene (NAP)). A C:N:P ratio of 100:5:1 was applied and the volumetric loading rate ranged from 2.11 to 2.21\u00a0kg COD\u00a0m\u22123\u00a0d\u22121 depending on the operating phases (three different periods). The first period of acclimatization took place from day 0 to day 41, where no DCP or DMP were added in the feeding solution and the target aromatic compound concentrations were as follows (in mgCOD\u00a0L\u22121): B: 461, T: 473, E: 190, X: 190, NAP: 46. For the second period, an inhibition by DCP was provoked (by DCP addition in the feed wastewater). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and naphthalene are both included as target compounds in a synthetic organic substrate used for a bioreactor experiment aimed at treating petrochemical wastewater. They are part of a mixture of aromatic compounds being evaluated for biodegradation, indicating a shared relevance in the study of wastewater treatment processes. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance in the bioreactor's performance are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and naphthalene, as they are both part of the same substrate mixture in the bioreactor study. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions within the context.",
