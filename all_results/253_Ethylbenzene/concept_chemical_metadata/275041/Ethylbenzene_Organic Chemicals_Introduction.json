    "context": "[2] List of genes and primer combinations used in quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays of gene expression. Hazardous xenobiotic organic compounds are introduced into the environment via wastewaters generated by human activities and industry. As a result of new legislation (Water Framework Directive, 2000), increased attention is being paid to the fate and mass balance of a number of dangerous pollutants during the conventional activated sludge treatment process. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene (BTEX) or volatile Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as naphthalene are commonly emitted into the environment due to their ubiquitous presence in fuel and petroleum products (Melcer, 1994). These xenobiotic compounds figure on the priority substances list established by the European Water Framework Directive because of their hazardous properties for the environment and their CMR (Cancer, Mutation and Reproduction) properties (An, 2004; Luch, 2005; Farhadian et\u00a0al., 2008). The aerobic biological process is one of the best technologies available for treating industrial wastewaters. Bioremediation is an efficient tool for transforming the compounds to less hazardous or non-hazardous forms with less input of chemicals, energy and time (Ward et\u00a0al., 2003). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is categorized as a volatile organic compound (VOC) and is mentioned alongside other organic chemicals like benzene and toluene. These compounds are highlighted due to their hazardous properties and their presence in industrial wastewaters, which necessitates effective treatment methods like bioremediation. Ethylbenzene's classification as an organic chemical underscores its relevance in discussions about environmental pollution and remediation strategies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and organic chemicals, as both are discussed in the context of environmental hazards and treatment processes. The mention of ethylbenzene as part of a group of hazardous organic compounds indicates a clear relationship within the context of pollution and bioremediation.",
