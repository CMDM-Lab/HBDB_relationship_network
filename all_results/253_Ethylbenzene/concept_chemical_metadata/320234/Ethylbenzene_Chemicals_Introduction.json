    "context": "VOCs are more ubiquitous in urban than in rural environments due to the use of paints and adhesives in indoor and outdoor settings (Saint-Georges et al., 2008). Indoor exposure to VOCs is more harmful than the exposure outside (USEPA, 1990). High levels of exposure to VOCs are mainly responsible for toxic effects (Koren and Devlin, 1992), whereas moderate exposure induces inflammatory responses (Wieslander et al., 1997), and low exposure causes breathing problems such as asthma and other allergic reactions (Diez et al., 2003; Herbarth et al., 2002). Among all the VOCs, benzene (BZ), toluene (TOL), o-xylene (o-XY), ethylbenzene (EBZ), trichloroethylene (TCE), and dichloromethane (DCM) are the most widely used chemicals in our environment. BZ is the most common and highly used industrial chemical and is also a component of gasoline (Gist and Burg, 1997). According to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines 2 (ERPG-2) of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the maximum recommended airborne concentration of benzene is 489mg/m3, but in adhesive-brushing industries in China, it has been detected at 1128.39mg/m3 (Liang et al., 2005). Most of the VOCs, including BZ, target the immune system of the body (Robinson et al., 1997). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EBZ) is identified as one of the most widely used volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban environments, alongside other chemicals like benzene and toluene. The discussion highlights the harmful effects of VOCs, including ethylbenzene, on health, particularly in relation to indoor exposure. However, the relationship is primarily categorical, as ethylbenzene is mentioned as part of a broader group of chemicals without specific interactions or detailed implications provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethylbenzene is categorized among other chemicals (VOCs) discussed in the context. While it is recognized as a harmful chemical, the relationship lacks detailed exploration or specific interactions.",
        "score": 2
