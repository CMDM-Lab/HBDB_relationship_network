    "context": "VOCs are more ubiquitous in urban than in rural environments due to the use of paints and adhesives in indoor and outdoor settings (Saint-Georges et al., 2008). Indoor exposure to VOCs is more harmful than the exposure outside (USEPA, 1990). High levels of exposure to VOCs are mainly responsible for toxic effects (Koren and Devlin, 1992), whereas moderate exposure induces inflammatory responses (Wieslander et al., 1997), and low exposure causes breathing problems such as asthma and other allergic reactions (Diez et al., 2003; Herbarth et al., 2002). Among all the VOCs, benzene (BZ), toluene (TOL), o-xylene (o-XY), ethylbenzene (EBZ), trichloroethylene (TCE), and dichloromethane (DCM) are the most widely used chemicals in our environment. BZ is the most common and highly used industrial chemical and is also a component of gasoline (Gist and Burg, 1997). According to the Emergency Response Planning Guidelines 2 (ERPG-2) of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the maximum recommended airborne concentration of benzene is 489mg/m3, but in adhesive-brushing industries in China, it has been detected at 1128.39mg/m3 (Liang et al., 2005). Most of the VOCs, including BZ, target the immune system of the body (Robinson et al., 1997). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are commonly used in various industrial applications, particularly in paints and adhesives. They are mentioned alongside other VOCs, highlighting their prevalence in urban environments and their potential toxic effects on health. However, the context does not provide specific details on their interactions or comparative effects, focusing instead on their general presence and associated health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are categorized as VOCs with similar usage and health implications. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions within the context.",
