    "context": "In this experiment, leaf Fv/Fm ratios were measured to give information on potential photosynthetic efficiency or the potential quantum yield of PSII between control and treated plants. Fm is the fluorescence to a maximum value, while Fv is the variable fluorescence. Photosynthesis in the control and the treated plants was determined by measurement with an FMS-2 portable pulse-modulated fluorometer. Leaves were clipped and allowed 5min for darkness adaptation before measurements were carried out.Effect of cuticle on toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency Cuticle was extracted from a 0.013m2 leaf area of the highest and lowest toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency plants by hexane and transferred onto an aluminum plate (size ~0.013m2). Hexane was evaporated and wax was then fumigated with 20ppm of toluene or ethylbenzene to study the removal efficiency. There were three replicates in each treatment. The gas sample was taken from a fumigation chamber at 72h to be analyzed by GC.Composition of cuticular wax analysis Cuticular wax of the twelve plants was analyzed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to its removal efficiency from plant cuticles, which were transferred onto aluminum plates for experimentation. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and aluminum is not directly discussed beyond the use of aluminum as a substrate for the cuticle analysis. There is no indication of a chemical or biological interaction between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethylbenzene is involved in a study utilizing aluminum plates for cuticle analysis, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
        "score": 2
