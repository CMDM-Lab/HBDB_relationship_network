    "context": "Furthermore, a literature review found that although under dark conditions, pollutant gas was continuously taken up by plants (Orwell et al., 2004). The physiology of plants stomata of each species, the physico-chemical properties of plants cuticles and the physico-chemical properties of the pollutants including its water solubility or lipophilicity might be important factors that affect the uptake efficiency of each species (Simonich and Hites, 1995). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the removal of toluene and ethylbenzene by plants along with the affecting factors, including stomata and cuticular, on toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency. The twelve plant species studied for toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency were Aloe vera, Sansevieria masoniana, Sansevieria trifasciata, Sansevieria hyacinthoides, Sansevieria ehrenbergii, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, Dracaena deremensis \u2018Lemon lime\u2019, Dracaena sanderiana, Codiaeum variegatum, Chlorophytum comosum, Cordyline fruticosa and Aglaonema commutatum. Screening plants for toluene and ethylbenzene removal The twelve plant species were purchased from ornamental plant shops in Thailand. In order to get all test plants of similar leaf area, the twelve plant species leaf areas were measured by graph paper. The leaf area of 0.013m2 was chosen for the experiment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as pollutants being investigated for their removal efficiency by various plant species. The study aims to understand how different physiological factors of the plants, such as stomatal and cuticular properties, influence the uptake of these two volatile organic compounds. While both compounds are studied together, the specific interactions or comparative removal efficiencies between them are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the same study focusing on their removal by plants. However, the context does not provide in-depth analysis or direct comparison of their interactions, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
