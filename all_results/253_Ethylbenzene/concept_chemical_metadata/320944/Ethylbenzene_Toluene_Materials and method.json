    "context": "Fm is the fluorescence to a maximum value, while Fv is the variable fluorescence. Photosynthesis in the control and the treated plants was determined by measurement with an FMS-2 portable pulse-modulated fluorometer. Leaves were clipped and allowed 5min for darkness adaptation before measurements were carried out.Effect of cuticle on toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency Cuticle was extracted from a 0.013m2 leaf area of the highest and lowest toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency plants by hexane and transferred onto an aluminum plate (size ~0.013m2). Hexane was evaporated and wax was then fumigated with 20ppm of toluene or ethylbenzene to study the removal efficiency. There were three replicates in each treatment. The gas sample was taken from a fumigation chamber at 72h to be analyzed by GC.Composition of cuticular wax analysis Cuticular wax of the twelve plants was analyzed. Leaves of the selected plants were immersed in hexane for 24h to remove the waxes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both examined for their removal efficiency from plant cuticles. The study investigates how cuticular wax from different plants interacts with these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during fumigation. The relationship is centered on their comparative analysis in terms of removal efficiency, indicating a direct connection in the context of plant physiology and VOC absorption.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are analyzed for their removal efficiency from plant cuticles, demonstrating a clear relationship in the context of plant interactions with VOCs.",
        "score": 4
