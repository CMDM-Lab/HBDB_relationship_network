    "context": "On the contrary, in ethylbenzene treated plants, the results showed significant difference between the control and the treated plants (P\u22640.05) after the end of the exposure period in D. deremensis, D. sanderiana, K. blossfeldiana and C. fruticosa plants (Table 1). It should be noted that the four species that had a significant difference in Fv/Fm ratio between the control and the treated plants also had low ethylbenzene removal efficiency after exposure to ethylbenzene for 72h (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). This may indicate that ethylbenzene is toxic to these plants and affects the removal efficiency. Furthermore, these results also indicated that ethylbenzene is more toxic to plants than toluene. Chlorophyll fluorescence has been shown to represent changes in the health and function of the photosynthetic apparatus. The reduction values of the Fv/Fm ratio might be associated with damage to the photosynthetic apparatus (Guo et al., 2006; Cassana et al., 2010). Previous studies showed the effects of other VOC vapors on the cell ultrastructure plant leaves (Korte et al., 2000; Sadunishvili et al., 2009). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are compared regarding their toxicity to plants. The results indicate that ethylbenzene is more toxic than toluene, as evidenced by significant differences in the Fv/Fm ratio between control and treated plants exposed to ethylbenzene. This suggests that while both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their effects on plant health differ, with ethylbenzene exhibiting greater detrimental impacts on photosynthetic function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as the context provides evidence of their differing toxicities to plants, supported by statistical analysis of the Fv/Fm ratio. This indicates a clear relationship in terms of their biological effects.",
        "score": 4
