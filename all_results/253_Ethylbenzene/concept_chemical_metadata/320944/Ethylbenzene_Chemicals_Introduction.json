    "context": "This study also showed E. gracilis is a potential suitable model for monitoring the biological effect of BTEX in the ground water with cell morphology, chlorophyll content and cell growth rate as endpoints. Conflict of interest All authors agreed that there is no conflict of interest involved in the manuscript. Recently, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have become a major pollutant problem of indoor air environments. Toluene and ethylbenzene are chemicals in a group of VOCs that are also found in indoor air habitations (Bernstein et al., 2008). Toluene can be found in many products such as gasoline, paints and fingernail polish (ATSDR, 1994), while ethylbenzene is also present in paints, lacquers and insecticides (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 2000). These compounds can create a hazard to human health and the environment when present in air. Furthermore, they have been linked to problems with the nervous system, liver, kidneys, and respiratory system (Kishi et al., 1993; WHO, 1996). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a specific chemical within the broader category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are recognized as significant pollutants in indoor air environments. The text highlights ethylbenzene's presence in various products, linking it to potential health hazards affecting the nervous system, liver, kidneys, and respiratory system. This establishes a clear relationship between ethylbenzene and the general category of chemicals, particularly those that pose environmental and health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and chemicals, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a VOC and discussed in relation to its health impacts. The context provides specific examples of products containing ethylbenzene, indicating its relevance as a hazardous chemical.",
