    "context": "The wax composition of twelve species was analyzed by GC\u2013MS and the results are shown in  Fig. 2. In this experiment, high hexadecanoic acid was found in S. trifasciata, S. hyacinthoides and S. masoniana, respectively. High amounts of alpha-lenolenic acid were found in D. sanderiana, A. vera and C. variegatum, about 62.7 percent, 62.5 percent and 61.2 percent, respectively. It should be noted that S. trifasciata and S. hyacinthoides, which had greater absorption of toluene and ethylbenzene, contained high hexadecanoic acid and alpha-linolenic acid was not found in their cuticular wax. Thus, hexadecanoic acid might be involved in toluene and ethylbenzene adsorption by cuticle wax of plants. The correlation of percent of hexadecanoic acid or alpha-linolenic acid and the VOC removal is shown in  Fig. 3. Therefore, for the maximum improvement of VOCs from contaminant air by plants, the correlation of cuticle composition of each plant species and the physicochemical properties of the pollutants are interesting factors and should be of interest.Effects of toluene and ethylbenzene exposure on Fv/Fm ratios In this experiment the potential quantum yield of PSII was studied in order to determine the effects of toluene and ethylbenzene on plants. In toluene treated plants, the results showed no significant difference between the control and the treated plants (P\u22640.05) after the end of the exposure period. On the contrary, in ethylbenzene treated plants, the results showed significant difference between the control and the treated plants (P\u22640.05) after the end of the exposure period in D. deremensis, D. sanderiana, K. blossfeldiana and C. fruticosa plants (Table 1).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were absorbed by plant cuticles, specifically in relation to their wax composition. The study indicates that while toluene did not significantly affect the potential quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) in treated plants, ethylbenzene exposure resulted in significant differences in the same measure. This suggests that while both compounds are relevant in the context of plant interactions, their effects on plant physiology differ notably.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in relation to their absorption by plant cuticles and their effects on plant physiology. However, the specific interactions and comparative effects are not deeply explored, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
