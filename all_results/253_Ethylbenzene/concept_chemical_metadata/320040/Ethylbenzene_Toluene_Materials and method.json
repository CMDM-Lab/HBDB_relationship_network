    "context": "At the end of the work shift, after 8h, each monitor was retired and packed in the sealed container provided by the manufacturer. Once packed, all diffusers were sent for analysis as indicated by the 3M representative. Determinations were carried out by gas chromatography after desorption with carbon disulfide through a calibration curve using external standards. The environmental levels report for toluene, benzene and ethylbenzene was sent by e-mail to us from Braun Intertec, an AIHA (American Industrial Hygiene Association) accredited laboratory (Minneapolis, MN, USA).Biomonitoring of toluene exposure Two urine samples (20ml each), one pre-shift and another post-shift, were collected in plastic tubes from each participant in order to determine hippuric acid, a biomarker extensively used for biomonitoring toluene exposure. Samples were kept at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis by a modified NIOSH 8301 method. Briefly, 1ml of urine was added with 40\u03bcl HCl 6N and 0.3mg NaCl plus 4ml ethyl acetate. After a 5000rpm centrifugation for 5min, 200\u03bcl organic phase was extracted and ethyl acetate evaporated at 77\u00b0C for 50min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored for environmental exposure levels. The study involves biomonitoring toluene exposure through urine samples, where hippuric acid serves as a biomarker. While both compounds are analyzed in the same environmental context, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not discussed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both VOCs mentioned in the context of environmental monitoring, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their shared classification.",
