    "context": "A semi-industrial bioscrubber unit was then produced, and the water/cutting oil system was used to test the process on a larger scale. VOCs mixtures Two mixtures were used. The first one (1) was prepared by mixing equal liquid masses of the following 11 compounds: \u2022 Oxygenated compounds: methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), ethyl acetate (EA), butyl acetate (BA) [Carbo Erba Reagenti, 99%]. \u2022 Aromatic compounds: toluene, ethylbenzene (EB), p-xylene [Carbo Erba Reagenti, 99%]. \u2022 Halogenated compounds: 1,2 dichloroethane (DCE) and dichloromethane (DCM) [Carbo Erba Reagenti, 99%]. For the second mixture (2), p-xylene was replaced by xylene [Carbo Erba Reagenti, 99%].Laboratory unit In order to determine the apparent mass transfer coefficient and concentration at saturation of the VOCs, the following setup was used. An impinger, (500mL) which contained a 200mL water-cutting oil mixture, was fed by a gas flow (60Lh\u22121) containing VOCs (Fig. 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and p-xylene are both included as components of a volatile organic compound (VOC) mixture used in a semi-industrial bioscrubber unit. They are categorized under aromatic compounds, indicating they share similar chemical properties and are part of the same experimental setup. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or roles within the mixture beyond their inclusion.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and p-xylene are mentioned together in the context of a VOC mixture, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds. However, their relationship lacks detailed exploration or interaction within the study.",
