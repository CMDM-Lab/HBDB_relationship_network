    "context": "Fig. 6 shows the concentration at saturation of the compounds in water as a function of the reciprocal of the Henry coefficient (H \u22121) (Staudinger and Roberts, 1996). Our results confirm that the concentration at saturation depends on the hydrophilic character of the tested compounds. Three groups can be distinguished: hydrophobic compounds (aromatic and chlorinated compounds), esters and MIBK, and hydrophilic compounds with acetone, MEK and methanol. The comparison of our results shows that the concentration at saturation of DCE and BA is increased by a factor 2 and 5, respectively, while the concentration at saturation of toluene, EB and p-xylene seems to increase from 4\u20138mgL\u22121 to 30\u2013120mgL\u22121, respectively, so concentration increases 10\u201320 times. According to Table 4, the addition of oil to the aqueous phase has a considerable influence on the apparent transfer coefficient (k L a) of aromatic compounds. The apparent transfer coefficient values decrease by a factor 20.A reduction in k L a values by a factor 5 is also observed for chlorinated compounds and BA. It has to be specified that the absorption performance depends essentially on the physical aspects of gas\u2013liquid reactor design and operation (Trambouze et al., 1984). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as aromatic compounds whose concentrations at saturation in water are influenced by their hydrophobic characteristics. The results indicate that the concentration at saturation for ethylbenzene and 4-xylene increases significantly when compared to other compounds, suggesting a shared behavior in terms of solubility and transfer characteristics in aqueous environments. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or a direct relationship between the two compounds beyond their classification as aromatic compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are discussed in relation to their saturation concentrations and hydrophobic nature, indicating some level of interaction in the context of solubility, but lacking detailed exploration of their specific relationship.",
        "score": 3
