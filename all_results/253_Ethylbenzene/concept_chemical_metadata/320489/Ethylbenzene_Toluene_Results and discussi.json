    "context": "Fig. 6 shows the concentration at saturation of the compounds in water as a function of the reciprocal of the Henry coefficient (H \u22121) (Staudinger and Roberts, 1996). Our results confirm that the concentration at saturation depends on the hydrophilic character of the tested compounds. Three groups can be distinguished: hydrophobic compounds (aromatic and chlorinated compounds), esters and MIBK, and hydrophilic compounds with acetone, MEK and methanol. The comparison of our results shows that the concentration at saturation of DCE and BA is increased by a factor 2 and 5, respectively, while the concentration at saturation of toluene, EB and p-xylene seems to increase from 4\u20138mgL\u22121 to 30\u2013120mgL\u22121, respectively, so concentration increases 10\u201320 times. According to Table 4, the addition of oil to the aqueous phase has a considerable influence on the apparent transfer coefficient (k L a) of aromatic compounds. The apparent transfer coefficient values decrease by a factor 20.A reduction in k L a values by a factor 5 is also observed for chlorinated compounds and BA. It has to be specified that the absorption performance depends essentially on the physical aspects of gas\u2013liquid reactor design and operation (Trambouze et al., 1984). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both discussed as aromatic compounds whose concentrations at saturation in water are influenced by their hydrophobic characteristics. The results indicate that the concentration of toluene, along with ethylbenzene, significantly increases when compared to other compounds, suggesting a similar behavior in terms of solubility and transfer characteristics in aqueous environments. However, the relationship is primarily based on their physical properties rather than a direct chemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are analyzed together in terms of their saturation concentrations and hydrophobic nature, indicating a shared significance in the context of their behavior in water, but lacking detailed interaction or functional relationship.",
        "score": 3
