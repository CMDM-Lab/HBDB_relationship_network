The author had no financial and other conflicts that could have affected the conclusions arrived at in this communication. Conflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflict of interest. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as toluene (TOL), xylene (XYL) or ethylbenzene (EBZ) are the popular components of organic solvents that are widely used in industries (Peng and Lin, 2007). Exposure levels of these VOCs are very important indoors and outdoors because they are widespread in the environment and they could sometimes linger for years. Therefore, discovering surrogate markers associated with these VOCs are required to assess exposure risk. To date, biological monitoring of occupational exposure to VOCs was based on the determination of their specific metabolites in urine. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EBZ) is identified as a component of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are commonly used in organic solvents across various industries. The mention of ethylbenzene alongside other VOCs like toluene and xylene highlights its role as a significant organic solvent product. The context emphasizes the importance of monitoring exposure levels to these compounds due to their prevalence in the environment and potential health risks associated with them.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and organic solvent products, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a component of VOCs used in solvents. The context supports this relationship by discussing the implications of exposure to such compounds.",
        "score": 4
