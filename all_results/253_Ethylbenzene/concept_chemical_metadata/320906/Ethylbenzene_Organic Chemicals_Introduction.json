The author had no financial and other conflicts that could have affected the conclusions arrived at in this communication. Conflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflict of interest. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as toluene (TOL), xylene (XYL) or ethylbenzene (EBZ) are the popular components of organic solvents that are widely used in industries (Peng and Lin, 2007). Exposure levels of these VOCs are very important indoors and outdoors because they are widespread in the environment and they could sometimes linger for years. Therefore, discovering surrogate markers associated with these VOCs are required to assess exposure risk. To date, biological monitoring of occupational exposure to VOCs was based on the determination of their specific metabolites in urine. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EBZ) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that is a common component of organic solvents used in various industries. The mention of ethylbenzene alongside other VOCs like toluene and xylene highlights its classification as an organic chemical. The discussion emphasizes the importance of monitoring exposure levels to these VOCs due to their prevalence in the environment and potential health risks associated with them.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and organic chemicals, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a VOC and a component of organic solvents. The context discusses the relevance of monitoring exposure to these organic chemicals, indicating a clear relationship.",
        "score": 4
