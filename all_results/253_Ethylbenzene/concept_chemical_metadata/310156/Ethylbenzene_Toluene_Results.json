    "context": "Cytotoxic effects disappeared when cells were exposed to a mixture of the same pollutants at concentrations reduced to a quarter (A/4, B/4).Comparative sensitivity of three human cell lines VOC toxicity toward A549, HepG2 cells and human normal fibroblasts was compared. As shown in Table 4 , tumor-derived cells (A549, HepG2) and normal human fibroblasts were found to display similar growth inhibitions, after 4-day exposure to the pollutants.Dose-related expression of SPs Fig. 2 illustrates the levels of expression (as compared to controls) of HSP72, GRP78 and HSP90 in A549 cells exposed for 4 days to benzene as a function of its concentration in the culture medium. No significant change of expression level of HSP72 and HSP90 was observed for benzene concentrations inhibiting cell growth up to 80%. In the same way, no change of expression of these two SPs was observed after treatment with the others pollutants, i.e., toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene and chlorinated derivatives (not shown). Conversely, a dose-dependent increase of GRP78 expression was induced by benzene (Fig. 2) and by all the others pollutants (Fig. 3) . A direct relationship between the extent of growth inhibition and the levels of GRP78 overexpression induced by pollutants was observed. As determined by Post-Hoc Scheffe test, overexpression was only significant at doses leading to growth inhibitions over 40% (Fig. 4) . ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were tested for their cytotoxic effects on human cell lines, including A549 and HepG2 cells. The study compares the toxicity of these pollutants, indicating that both compounds contribute to growth inhibition in the tested cell lines. However, the specific interactions or differences in toxicity between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon, suggesting a general relationship as part of a broader analysis of VOC effects on cell viability.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are included in the same study assessing their cytotoxic effects on human cells. While they are part of the same analysis, the context does not provide detailed insights into their specific interactions or comparative toxicity.",
