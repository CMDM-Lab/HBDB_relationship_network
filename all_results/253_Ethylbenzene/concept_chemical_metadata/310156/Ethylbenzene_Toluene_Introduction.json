    "context": "Benzene is a well-known carcinogen that has been causally linked to leukaemia. Although toluene and xylene are not currently classified as carcinogens, Lundberg and Milatou-Smith reported an increase of cancer incidence in paint industry workers with long-term exposure to these organic solvents. Furthermore, increased risk for esophageal, rectal and colon cancers was suspected to be related to occupational exposure to toluene and xylene. Besides, a decrease of semen quality was observed in workers after occupational exposure to respective concentrations of ethylbenzene, toluene, xylene and benzene of 230, 200, 50 and 40 mg/m3  . Various adverse effects of ClB have been reported in industrial workplaces. Liver appears to be the primary site of injury by p-diCLB as subsequent cases of jaundice and cirrhosis have been reported. Painful irritations of the eyes and nose and breathing difficulties among workers were observed for p-diClB airborne concentrations of 80\u2013160 ppm. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as organic solvents associated with occupational exposure risks in the paint industry. While neither is classified as a carcinogen, long-term exposure to toluene has been linked to increased cancer incidence and decreased semen quality. The mention of both compounds highlights their shared relevance in discussions of health risks related to solvent exposure, but no direct interaction between them is specified.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in the context of occupational health risks, indicating a shared significance in the exposure-related health issues, but lacking detailed interaction or comparative analysis.",
        "score": 3
