    "context": "The significant distribution of five target petroleum-characteristic alkylkated PAH homologues and biomarkers unambiguously confirmed the presence of another heavy petroleum product. (2) Sample B (15\u201360 m) was also contaminated, but to a much lesser degree in comparison with sample A. The concentrations of the TPH and BTEX compounds were determined to be 130 and 2.6 \u03bcg/kg of water for sample B, respectively. (3) In addition, the contamination of a variety of volatile chlorinated compounds to the groundwater was also clearly demonstrated. The monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (collectively BTEX), and chlorobenzenes (ClB) are potential harmful substances commonly found in occupational or nonoccupational environments. BTEX are present in fuel, paint, rubber products and adhesives. Benzene and ethylbenzene are present in commercial gasoline at concentrations of 3\u20135% and up to 15%, respectively. ClB are current intermediates in dye and pesticide industrial synthesis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons included in the BTEX group, which also comprises benzene, toluene, and xylene. These compounds are recognized as harmful substances commonly found in various environments, particularly in fuel and industrial products. Ethylbenzene's classification as an aromatic hydrocarbon highlights its chemical structure and potential health risks associated with exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and aromatic hydrocarbons, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized within the BTEX group of aromatic compounds. The context provides evidence of its presence in commercial products and its associated risks, indicating a clear relationship.",
