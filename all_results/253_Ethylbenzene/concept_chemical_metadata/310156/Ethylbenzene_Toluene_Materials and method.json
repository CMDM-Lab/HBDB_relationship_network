    "context": "HSP expression was quantified in cells exposed for 4 days to pollutant concentrations ranging from no-observed effect (NOEC) on cellular proliferation up to sublethal doses. Experiments were carried out on two human tumor-derived cells in culture: A549 pneumocytes, as lung alveolar epithelial cells are the first target of volatile pollutants, and HepG2 hepatocytes, as liver plays a key role in metabolism and detoxification of chemicals. Besides, primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts were used as nontumoral reference cells. Chemicals and reagents Benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzenes were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company. 1,2,3-ClB, 1,3,5-ClB and 1,2,3,4-ClB were dissolved in dimethyl-cetone to make 100 mM stock solutions. Monoclonal mouse antibodies raised against HSP72 (SPA810), HSP72/73 (SPA822), HSP90 (SPA830) or GRP78 (SPA827) were from StressGen Biotechnologies. Peroxydase goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (A2554) was purchased from Sigma (France). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) obtained from the same supplier for experiments involving human tumor-derived cells. While they are part of a broader study on the effects of pollutants on cellular health, there is no specific discussion of their individual or comparative effects on the cells or their interactions. They are simply listed among other chemicals used in the research.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as VOCs in the context of a study, but there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or specific interactions within the experimental framework.",
        "score": 2
