    "context": "Higher T/B ratio (5.5) was found in Causeway Bay than in other urban areas, while T/B ratio of 1.2 was found in Hok Tsui. The concentrations of VOCs at five urban sites in Hong Kong were quantified by using canister with GC/MS system in accordance with the US EPA Method TO-14. The accuracies of VOCs analysis were validated with quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures. VOCs (1,3-butadiene, methylene chloride, chloroform, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene and styrene) were identified at roadside urban areas in Hong Kong. The concentrations of VOCs ranged from undetectable to 1396 \u03bcg/m3. Among all of the VOC species, toluene has the highest concentration. High concentrations of chlorinated compounds were found at Kwai Chung where it is located in an industrial area with industrial emissions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in urban air samples collected in Hong Kong. They are part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations at various urban sites, but there is no specific discussion of their relationship or interactions. Their mention is primarily as components of the VOC mixture without further elaboration on their individual or comparative significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are mentioned together in the context of VOC analysis, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
