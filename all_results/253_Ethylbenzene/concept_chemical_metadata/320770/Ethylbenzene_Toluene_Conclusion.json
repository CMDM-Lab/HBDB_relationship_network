    "context": "Among all of the VOC species, toluene has the highest concentration. High concentrations of chlorinated compounds were found at Kwai Chung where it is located in an industrial area with industrial emissions. Hok Tsui served as a background station with VOC concentrations less than 10 \u03bcg/m3 since there were no significant anthropologenic sources. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) were mainly from vehicle exhausts, while chlorinated compounds were mainly from industries, cleaning processes and chemical solvents. However, mixed sources were frequently observed at Mong Kok and Causeway Bay. The concentrations of VOCs in Hong Kong were similar to other cities in the world. However, the ratios of T/B (average T/B ratio=5) were higher in Hong Kong than that of other cities (average T/B ratio=2 or 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) primarily originating from vehicle exhausts. The study highlights the concentration levels of these compounds in various locations in Hong Kong, noting that toluene has the highest concentration among VOCs. The T/B ratio indicates a higher prevalence of toluene relative to ethylbenzene in Hong Kong compared to other cities, suggesting a significant relationship in their sources and environmental impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in relation to their concentrations and sources as VOCs. However, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or effects, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
        "score": 3
