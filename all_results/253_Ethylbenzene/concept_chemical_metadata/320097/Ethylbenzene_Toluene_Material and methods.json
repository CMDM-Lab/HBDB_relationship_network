    "context": "The negative control comprised ultra-pure water and the positive control methyl methanesulfonate \u2013 MMS (CAS No. 66-27-3) at 4\u00d710\u22124 M. These same five samples of BTEX were submitted to a biodegradation process by bacteria selected from a raw effluent of a petroleum refinery. The method used to perform the biodegradation was the one described by Mazzeo et al. (2010). After this process, the biodegraded samples presented the following concentration: BTEX 1 (benzene: 322.25mgL\u22121, toluene: 63.7mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 14.8mgL\u22121 and xylene: 4.04mgL\u22121), BTEX 2 (benzene: 20.7mgL\u22121, toluene: 2.5mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 0.3mgL\u22121 and xylene: 0.4mgL\u22121), BTEX 3 (benzene: 0.08mgL\u22121, toluene: 0.03mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 0.01mgL\u22121, xylene: absent), BTEX 4 (benzene: 0.035mgL\u22121, toluene: 0.016mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: absent, xylene: absent), BTEX 5 (all absent). The negative control was performed with ultra pure water and the positive control with methyl methanesulfonate \u2013 MMS (CAS No. 66-27-3), in a concentration of 4\u00d710\u22124 M. Culture medium of the bacteria used in the samples\u2019 degradation was used as a blank.Test-organism Seeds of A. cepa (2n =16 chromosomes) of a same stock and variety were used to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic BTEX effects of the five tested samples.Chromosome aberration and micronucleus tests The seeds of A. cepa were germinated in glass jars (500mL), with Teflon membrane caps, to prevent the compounds to volatilize into the atmosphere, assuring that the BTEX samples would remain the same during the entire experimental period. The assays were performed by adding 60mL of each non-biodegraded and biodegraded BTEX sample, MMS (positive control), ultra-pure water (negative control) and blank solution (biodegradation control) in separated jars. All assays were carried out in duplicate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) that were subjected to a biodegradation process by bacteria. The concentrations of both compounds were measured before and after biodegradation, indicating their presence in the same environmental study. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed, as they are treated as part of a mixture rather than being directly related to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of biodegradation but lack a detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
