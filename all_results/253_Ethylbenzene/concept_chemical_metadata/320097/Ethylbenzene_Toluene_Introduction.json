    "context": "Petroleum and derivatives have been considered one of the major environmental contaminants. Due to their worldwide and massive production, transportation and utilization as primary energy source and raw material for several products like plastic, solvents, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fuel, synthetic rubber among others, many researchers have been attempting to evaluate the potential impacts of these compounds in both environment and human beings. Environmental contamination by petroleum and derivatives spills has been commonly reported as a consequence of accidents in loading, discharging, transportation, production of byproducts and combustion (Pedrozo et al., 2002). BTEX is an acronym that stands for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. These are volatile organic compounds commonly found in petroleum derivatives that have been particularly studied once they present toxic properties, mobility in the environment and high solubility in water. These features make BTEX a major concern in water pollution, particularly in groundwater contamination (Lovley, 1997; Anneser et al., 2008). Benzene is recognizably carcinogenic to humans, likely to cause leukaemia and some types of lymphoma (Bird et al., 2005). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. These volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are derived from petroleum and are noted for their toxic properties and environmental mobility. The discussion highlights their significance as environmental contaminants, particularly in relation to water pollution and human health risks, but does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative toxicity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are part of the same group of VOCs (BTEX) and are discussed in the context of environmental contamination and toxicity. However, their specific relationship or interactions are not elaborated upon.",
        "score": 3
