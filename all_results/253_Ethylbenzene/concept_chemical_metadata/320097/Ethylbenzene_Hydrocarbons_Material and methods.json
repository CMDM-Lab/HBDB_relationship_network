    "context": "Several tests to identify the presence of potentially genotoxic and mutagenic chemical compounds have been successfully performed with this plant. Meristematic and F1 cells of A. cepa present some features that are suitable for cytogenetic studies, thereby being recommended to evaluate both chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei assays for environmental pollutants evaluation (Ateeq et al., 2002; Matsumoto and Marin-Morales, 2004; Fernandes et al., 2007; Carit\u00e1 and Marin-Morales, 2008; Leme and Marin-Morales, 2008). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the putative genotoxic and mutagenic effects of different concentrations of BTEX and their biodegraded products through analyses of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei (MN) in meristematic and F1 cells of A. cepa roots, as well as test the efficacy of biodegradation in reducing the harmful effects of BTEX. Tested hydrocarbons To perform the experiments, we tested the BTEX mixture that comprises benzene (purity of 99% \u2013 CAS No. 71-43-2), toluene (purity of 99% \u2013 CAS No. 108-88-3), ethylbenzene (purity of 99.80% \u2013 CAS No. 100-41-4) and xylene (purity of 99%, mixture of isomers \u2013 CAS No. 1330-20-7). Five different BTEX samples were prepared. The first sample (BTEX 1) was prepared considering the water solubility indexes for each BTEX compound (benzene: 1780mgL\u22121, toluene: 535mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 152mgL\u22121 and xylenes: 135mgL\u22121 \u2013 this value corresponds to the solubility of the less soluble isomer, m-xylene). The other two samples were obtained by diluting BTEX 1 by 10 (BTEX 2) and 100 (BTEX 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the components of the BTEX mixture, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylene, all of which are classified as hydrocarbons. The study aims to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of these hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene, on plant cells. The relationship is established through the inclusion of ethylbenzene in the broader category of hydrocarbons being tested for environmental toxicity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and hydrocarbons, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as part of the BTEX mixture, which is a group of hydrocarbons. The context discusses their potential harmful effects, indicating a clear relevance.",
        "score": 4
