    "context": "The aim of the present work was to evaluate the putative genotoxic and mutagenic effects of different concentrations of BTEX and their biodegraded products through analyses of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei (MN) in meristematic and F1 cells of A. cepa roots, as well as test the efficacy of biodegradation in reducing the harmful effects of BTEX. Tested hydrocarbons To perform the experiments, we tested the BTEX mixture that comprises benzene (purity of 99% \u2013 CAS No. 71-43-2), toluene (purity of 99% \u2013 CAS No. 108-88-3), ethylbenzene (purity of 99.80% \u2013 CAS No. 100-41-4) and xylene (purity of 99%, mixture of isomers \u2013 CAS No. 1330-20-7). Five different BTEX samples were prepared. The first sample (BTEX 1) was prepared considering the water solubility indexes for each BTEX compound (benzene: 1780mgL\u22121, toluene: 535mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 152mgL\u22121 and xylenes: 135mgL\u22121 \u2013 this value corresponds to the solubility of the less soluble isomer, m-xylene). The other two samples were obtained by diluting BTEX 1 by 10 (BTEX 2) and 100 (BTEX 3). BTEX 4 was prepared according to the highest acceptable concentrations of each BTEX compound in drinking water, as established by the Environmental Sanitation Technology Company of S\u00e3o Paulo State/Brazil \u2013 CETESB (2004) (benzene: 5\u03bcgL\u22121, toluene: 170\u03bcgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 200\u03bcgL\u22121 and total xylenes: 300\u03bcgL\u22121). The fifth sample (BTEX 5) was prepared simulating the mixture in values below the acceptable threshold for drinking water (benzene: 1.25\u03bcgL\u22121, toluene: 42.5\u03bcgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 50\u03bcgL\u22121 and total xylenes: 75\u03bcgL\u22121).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both components of the BTEX mixture, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The study evaluates the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of these compounds and their biodegraded products. While both are part of the same chemical group and are tested together, the specific interactions or comparative effects between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene, as they are both part of the BTEX mixture being studied for their effects. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the context.",
