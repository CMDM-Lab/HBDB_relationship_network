    "context": "[3] Significant increases in blood BTEX levels were observed in runners between pre- and postexercise for toluene (mean increase of 1.4 ng/ml; p=0.002), ethylbenzene (0.7 ng/ml; p=0.0003), m/p-xylene (2.0 ng/ml; p=0.004) and o-xylene (1.1 ng/ml; p=0.002), but no change was observed for benzene. [1] Conclusions Blood BTEX levels are increased during high-intensity exercise such as running undertaken in areas with BTEX pollution, even with a short duration of exercise. [2] This may have health implications for runners who regularly exercise near roadways. [1] Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in crude petroleum and petroleum products such as petrol. [2] The main sources of urban VOC pollution are road transport, industrial sources, wood smoke and landfill sites.,, [3] Individuals are also exposed to VOCs indoors at levels often exceeding health benchmarks for outdoor exposure,  with smoking a particular risk. [4] Typical daily exposure has been reported with geometric means in the order of 0.80, 2.8, 0.5 and 2.4 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, respectively, but there is a large variation in these figures with ranges of up to 23.8, 2120, 119 and 697 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3, respectively, in a sample of 204 subjects from a cross-sectional study in non-occupationally exposed non-smokers.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are commonly found in crude petroleum and its products, such as petrol. The study highlights the increase in blood levels of ethylbenzene during high-intensity exercise in areas with BTEX pollution, indicating a direct link between ethylbenzene exposure and petroleum sources. This relationship underscores the health implications for individuals exercising near roadways where petroleum-derived VOCs are prevalent.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as a VOC derived from petroleum products. The context provides evidence of its presence in blood during exercise, linking it directly to petroleum exposure.",
