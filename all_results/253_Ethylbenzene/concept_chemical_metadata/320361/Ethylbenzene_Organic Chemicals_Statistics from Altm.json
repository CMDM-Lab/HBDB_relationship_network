    "context": "[3] Significant increases in blood BTEX levels were observed in runners between pre- and postexercise for toluene (mean increase of 1.4 ng/ml; p=0.002), ethylbenzene (0.7 ng/ml; p=0.0003), m/p-xylene (2.0 ng/ml; p=0.004) and o-xylene (1.1 ng/ml; p=0.002), but no change was observed for benzene. [1] Conclusions Blood BTEX levels are increased during high-intensity exercise such as running undertaken in areas with BTEX pollution, even with a short duration of exercise. [2] This may have health implications for runners who regularly exercise near roadways. [1] Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in crude petroleum and petroleum products such as petrol. [2] The main sources of urban VOC pollution are road transport, industrial sources, wood smoke and landfill sites.,, [3] Individuals are also exposed to VOCs indoors at levels often exceeding health benchmarks for outdoor exposure,  with smoking a particular risk. [4] Typical daily exposure has been reported with geometric means in the order of 0.80, 2.8, 0.5 and 2.4 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, respectively, but there is a large variation in these figures with ranges of up to 23.8, 2120, 119 and 697 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3, respectively, in a sample of 204 subjects from a cross-sectional study in non-occupationally exposed non-smokers.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylene. These compounds are commonly found in petroleum products and are significant organic chemicals contributing to urban air pollution. The study highlights the increase in blood levels of ethylbenzene during high-intensity exercise, indicating its relevance as an organic chemical in environmental health discussions, particularly concerning exposure risks for individuals exercising in polluted areas.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and organic chemicals, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a VOC and part of the BTEX group, which is significant in discussions of urban pollution and health implications.",
        "score": 4
