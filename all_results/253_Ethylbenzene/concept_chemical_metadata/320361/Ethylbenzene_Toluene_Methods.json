    "context": "[4] Blood samples contained in the heparinised BD Vacutainer tubeswere stored in ice in the field, and then transferred to \u00e2\u02c6\u201930\u00c2\u00b0C storage before analysis. [5] Analysis of the VOC concentration in blood was undertaken at the Central Science Laboratory at the University of Tasmania using a solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography\u00e2\u20ac\u201cmass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) method. [1] In brief, 1 ml of blood sample was quantitatively transferred into a 7 ml glass vial using a micropipette and capped with a Teflon-lined silicon septum. [2] Twenty microlitres of a methanolic solution containing deuterated standards (0.25 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml D10-ethylbenzene, D6-benzene, D10-oxylene and D8-toluene internal standard; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the phial with a micropipette. [3] Vials were heated to 50\u00c2\u00b0C and stirred on a combination hotplate/stirrer. [4] BTEX analytes were adsorbed onto a 100 \u00ce\u00bcm polydimethylsiloxane SPME syringe needle (Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich), and the fibre extraction was carried out for 12 min. [5] The fibre was then removed from the phial and immediately inserted into the GC-SPME injector port for 3 min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in blood samples using a solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) method. They are included in a list of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene) analytes, indicating they are part of the same analytical process. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance within the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as VOCs analyzed in the same method, but their relationship lacks direct interaction or functional significance in the context provided.",
