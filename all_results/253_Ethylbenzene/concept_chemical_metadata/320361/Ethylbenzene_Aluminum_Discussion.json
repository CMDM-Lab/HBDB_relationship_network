    "context": "[1] The BTEX environmental levels detected in this microenvironment were in general agreement with other international reports of traffic-related emissions. [2] Environmental BTEX levels associated with transport related pollution vary widely and depend on many factors including traffic density and the microenvironment. [3] Recent reports of total BTEX levels in Australia at traffic intersections have been reported at around 6.2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6.5 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3, but urban levels have been reported over a wide range of values that may be 10-fold higher or more. [4] The ethylbenzene levels were much higher than expected and could potentially be attributed to several different sources including relaying of an artificial turf playing surface approximately 200 m downwind of the study site, and several small commercial and light industries 1 km upwind including shower screen manufacture, plastics, spray painters and an aluminium supplier. [5] In addition to the BTEX results, the environmental sampling also detected styrene at 1200 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (a semiquantitative result beyond the linear calibration range) and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene at 26 and 21 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3, respectively. [1] The blood BTEX results in this current study are higher than those expected based on previously suggested reference values in non-occupationally exposed non-smokers. [2] Reference values have been reported at 0.13 ng/ml, 0.52 ng/ml, 0.11 ng/ml, 0.37 ng/ml and 0.14 ng/ml for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to environmental pollution levels, particularly from traffic and industrial sources, including an aluminum supplier. However, there is no direct discussion of a chemical or biological relationship between ethylbenzene and aluminum. The mention of aluminum is incidental, as it is one of several potential sources of ethylbenzene emissions, without any specific interaction or relevance to ethylbenzene's properties or effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as ethylbenzene and aluminum are mentioned in the same context regarding environmental pollution, but there is no direct interaction or relevance between the two substances.",
