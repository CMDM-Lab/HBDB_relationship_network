    "context": "[3] Additionally, it must be remembered that benzene was not observed in the environmental sampling or significantly increased in blood. [4] Based on the environmental levels alone, apart from potential respiratory effects, the risk of other serious health effects due to toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene in this study appears low. [5] The American Conference of Industrial Hygienists recommends a threshold limit value\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctime-weighted average (TLV-TWA) of 50 ppm for toluene based on subtle neurological impairment, a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm for ethylbenzene based on irritation and central nervous system effects and a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm for xylene isomers (o-, m-, p-) based on irritation to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin. [6] Toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are not listed as known or anticipated human carcinogens by the US National Toxicology Program, but ethylbenzene is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a possible human carcinogen based on evidence in animals. [7] This is in stark contrast to benzene with a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm and classification as a carcinogen in humans. [1] In conclusion, high-intensity roadside running, although of short duration, has the potential to expose runners to relatively high amounts of BTEX mass which can be observed in increased blood concentrations. [2] This may have health implications for runners who regularly exercise near roadways. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with established threshold limit values (TLVs) for occupational exposure. While both are associated with potential health effects, including neurological impairment and irritation, ethylbenzene is specifically noted as a possible human carcinogen, contrasting with toluene's lower risk classification. Their relationship is highlighted through their shared context of health implications in environmental exposure, particularly for individuals exercising near roadways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are VOCs with established health risk guidelines. The context provides comparative information on their health effects and regulatory classifications, indicating a clear relationship in terms of occupational and environmental health.",
        "score": 4
