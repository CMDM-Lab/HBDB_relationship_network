    "context": "[4] BTEX are popular solvents, are highly evaporative, are found indoors including the laboratory, and outdoors from a variety of sources, and are found in the blood of non-occupationally exposed individuals at very low levels but above typical detection limits of modern analytical instrumentation. [5] Hence, blank bloods cannot be used for calibration purposes, and other matrices such as water cannot be used, as SPME extraction efficiency varies between matrices. [6] Trace BTEX levels in subjects at baseline may have been raised by environmental contamination, non-disclosed smoking or petrol station exposure, passive smoke, time in doors, car travel, unknown occupational exposure, as well as ethanol consumption. [1] The blood toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene levels increased over the exercise period for all runners with an average increase of 1.4, 0.7, 2.0 and 1.1 ng/ml, respectively, over the exercise period of 20 min. [2] This result is consistent with previous studies involving cyclists, but these studies were all of considerably longer duration. [3] Both Andreoli et al and Bergamaschi et al have reported significant increases in benzene and toluene blood levels in cyclists over a 2 h period. [4] From our current study, it appears that even a short duration of exercise has the potential to increase blood BTEX levels. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), which are volatile organic compounds commonly found in the environment and known to increase in blood levels during physical activity. The study highlights the presence of these compounds in the blood of individuals, particularly after exercise, but does not delve into a specific interaction or relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their classification as BTEX components.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both part of the BTEX group and are mentioned in the same context regarding blood levels during exercise. However, there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interaction.",
