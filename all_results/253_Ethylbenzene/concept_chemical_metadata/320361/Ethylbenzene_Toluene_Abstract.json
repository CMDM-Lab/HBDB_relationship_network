    "context": "[4] Environmental BTEX levels were determined by passive adsorption samplers. [1] Results Subjects completed a mean (range) distance of 4.4 (3.4 to 5.2) km over 20 min (4.5 (3.8 to 5.9) min/km pace), with a mean (SD) exercise intensity of 93 (2.3)% HRmax, and mean (SD) ventilation significantly elevated compared with resting levels (86.2 (2.3) vs 8.7 (0.9) l/min; p<0.001). [2] The mean (SD) environmental levels (time weighted average) were determined as 53.1 (4.2), 428 (83), and 80.0 (3.7) \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 for toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, respectively, while benzene was below the detectable limit due to the short exposure period. [3] Significant increases in blood BTEX levels were observed in runners between pre- and postexercise for toluene (mean increase of 1.4 ng/ml; p=0.002), ethylbenzene (0.7 ng/ml; p=0.0003), m/p-xylene (2.0 ng/ml; p=0.004) and o-xylene (1.1 ng/ml; p=0.002), but no change was observed for benzene. [1] Conclusions Blood BTEX levels are increased during high-intensity exercise such as running undertaken in areas with BTEX pollution, even with a short duration of exercise. [2] This may have health implications for runners who regularly exercise near roadways. [1] Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in crude petroleum and petroleum products such as petrol. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the blood of runners exposed to environmental BTEX levels during high-intensity exercise. The study reports significant increases in blood levels of both compounds post-exercise, indicating a direct relationship in terms of exposure and physiological response during activities in polluted areas. However, the specific interactions or comparative effects of ethylbenzene and toluene on health are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are measured and reported together in the context of exercise-induced exposure to BTEX pollutants. The quantitative data on their blood levels supports their relevance, although the lack of detailed interaction limits the score from reaching a 5.",
