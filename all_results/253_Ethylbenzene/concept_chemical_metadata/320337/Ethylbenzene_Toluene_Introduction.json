    "context": "Smet et al. (1999) found that alcohols, carbonyl compounds, terpenes, esters, sulphur compounds and ethers were present in aerobic composting waste gases. Pierucci et al. (2005) identified the most important compounds in effluent gas from biological treatment of MSW were terpenes, monocyclic arenes (C2, C3 and C4 benzenes), alkanes, halogenated compounds and esters. Biofiltration is a viable control technology based on its low cost and non-generating of hazardous residue and interesting ability to remove odorous compounds (Mohseni and Allen, 2000; Rappert and M\u00fcller, 2005; Nevin and Barford, 2000). Several recent studies have reported effective elimination of VOCs, such as ethylbenzene (Alvarez-Hornos et al., 2008), benzene (Zilli et al., 2005), styrene (Jorio et al., 2000) and toluene (Rene et al., 2005) using biofilters. In a biofilter, a contaminated/odorous gas stream passes through a biologically enriched layer of a filter material such as soil, wood chips, compost or mixed materials, followed by biodegradation of the adsorbed pollutants (e.g. Chung et al., 2005; Pagans et al., 2007a). Absorption should be considered as an important mechanism of pollutant removal in the biofilter, especially when highly soluble pollutants are treated (Pagans et al., 2007b). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) effectively eliminated using biofiltration technology. The studies referenced highlight their presence in contaminated gas streams and their removal through biological treatment processes. While both compounds are mentioned in relation to biofiltration, the context does not detail their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their shared application in VOC removal.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in the context of biofiltration for VOC removal. However, their relationship is not deeply explored, indicating they are part of a broader category of compounds treated similarly rather than having a direct interaction.",
