    "context": "In our biofilter, the maximum VOC elimination capacity of 17.55gCm\u22123 h\u22121 could be reached at a loading rate of 31.16gCm\u22123 h\u22121. However, this value can not be defined as the actual maximum elimination capacity because higher loading rates were not tested in our study.VOCs emitted during MSW biostabilization and biofilter\u2019s removal ability During the period II of biofilter operation, the GC\u2013MS quantitative analysis of VOCs in influent and effluent gas of biofilter were carried out and 40 different chemical compounds were identified in the odorous gases from MSW biostabilization process. The prevailing groups were alkylated benzenes (ethylbenzene, xylene, toluene and ethyltoluene), followed by alkanes (n-decane, nonane, heptane and cyclohexane), alkenes (2-methyl-hexene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene), terpenes (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and naphthalene) and sulphur compounds (dimethyl disulfide, carbon bisulfide and dimethyl sulfide) (see Table 4 ). High amounts of VOCs (alkanes and alkylated benzenes) emitted from MSW biostabilization process indicating that these compounds could be a result of decomposition (Komilis et al., 2004). Alkanes (heptane, octane, nonane and n-decane) concentrations reached the maximum value of 60.27\u03bcgheptanem\u22123, 79.56\u03bcgoctanem\u22123, 665.53\u03bcgnonanem\u22123 and 1060.96\u03bcg n-decanem\u22123 at the beginning of ventilation and then decreased with time during the study.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dimethyl disulfide are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). They are part of a broader analysis of various chemical compounds released during this process, but no specific interaction or functional relationship between ethylbenzene and dimethyl disulfide is discussed. Their mention is primarily in the context of their presence in the gas emissions rather than any direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs emitted during the same process. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions, limiting their relevance to a general association.",
