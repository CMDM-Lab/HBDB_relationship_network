    "context": "In our biofilter, the maximum VOC elimination capacity of 17.55gCm\u22123 h\u22121 could be reached at a loading rate of 31.16gCm\u22123 h\u22121. However, this value can not be defined as the actual maximum elimination capacity because higher loading rates were not tested in our study.VOCs emitted during MSW biostabilization and biofilter\u2019s removal ability During the period II of biofilter operation, the GC\u2013MS quantitative analysis of VOCs in influent and effluent gas of biofilter were carried out and 40 different chemical compounds were identified in the odorous gases from MSW biostabilization process. The prevailing groups were alkylated benzenes (ethylbenzene, xylene, toluene and ethyltoluene), followed by alkanes (n-decane, nonane, heptane and cyclohexane), alkenes (2-methyl-hexene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene), terpenes (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and naphthalene) and sulphur compounds (dimethyl disulfide, carbon bisulfide and dimethyl sulfide) (see Table 4 ). High amounts of VOCs (alkanes and alkylated benzenes) emitted from MSW biostabilization process indicating that these compounds could be a result of decomposition (Komilis et al., 2004). Alkanes (heptane, octane, nonane and n-decane) concentrations reached the maximum value of 60.27\u03bcgheptanem\u22123, 79.56\u03bcgoctanem\u22123, 665.53\u03bcgnonanem\u22123 and 1060.96\u03bcg n-decanem\u22123 at the beginning of ventilation and then decreased with time during the study.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and decane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). Ethylbenzene is categorized among alkylated benzenes, while decane is classified as an alkane. They are part of a broader analysis of VOCs, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between them is discussed beyond their classification as components of the emitted gases.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and decane are mentioned together in the context of VOC emissions from MSW biostabilization. However, their relationship is primarily categorical, with no detailed interaction or functional significance provided.",
