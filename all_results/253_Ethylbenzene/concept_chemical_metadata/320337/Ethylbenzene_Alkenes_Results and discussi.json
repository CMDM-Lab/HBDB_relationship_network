    "context": "In our biofilter, the maximum VOC elimination capacity of 17.55gCm\u22123 h\u22121 could be reached at a loading rate of 31.16gCm\u22123 h\u22121. However, this value can not be defined as the actual maximum elimination capacity because higher loading rates were not tested in our study.VOCs emitted during MSW biostabilization and biofilter\u2019s removal ability During the period II of biofilter operation, the GC\u2013MS quantitative analysis of VOCs in influent and effluent gas of biofilter were carried out and 40 different chemical compounds were identified in the odorous gases from MSW biostabilization process. The prevailing groups were alkylated benzenes (ethylbenzene, xylene, toluene and ethyltoluene), followed by alkanes (n-decane, nonane, heptane and cyclohexane), alkenes (2-methyl-hexene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene), terpenes (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and naphthalene) and sulphur compounds (dimethyl disulfide, carbon bisulfide and dimethyl sulfide) (see Table 4 ). High amounts of VOCs (alkanes and alkylated benzenes) emitted from MSW biostabilization process indicating that these compounds could be a result of decomposition (Komilis et al., 2004). Alkanes (heptane, octane, nonane and n-decane) concentrations reached the maximum value of 60.27\u03bcgheptanem\u22123, 79.56\u03bcgoctanem\u22123, 665.53\u03bcgnonanem\u22123 and 1060.96\u03bcg n-decanem\u22123 at the beginning of ventilation and then decreased with time during the study.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the alkylated benzenes among the various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during municipal solid waste (MSW) biostabilization. Alkenes, such as 2-methyl-hexene and butenes, are also mentioned as part of the VOCs identified. While both terms are part of the broader category of organic compounds emitted during the same process, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between ethylbenzene and alkenes.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both ethylbenzene and alkenes are mentioned in the context of VOCs emitted during MSW biostabilization. However, their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating a general category overlap rather than a specific interaction.",
