    "context": "In our biofilter, the maximum VOC elimination capacity of 17.55gCm\u22123 h\u22121 could be reached at a loading rate of 31.16gCm\u22123 h\u22121. However, this value can not be defined as the actual maximum elimination capacity because higher loading rates were not tested in our study.VOCs emitted during MSW biostabilization and biofilter\u2019s removal ability During the period II of biofilter operation, the GC\u2013MS quantitative analysis of VOCs in influent and effluent gas of biofilter were carried out and 40 different chemical compounds were identified in the odorous gases from MSW biostabilization process. The prevailing groups were alkylated benzenes (ethylbenzene, xylene, toluene and ethyltoluene), followed by alkanes (n-decane, nonane, heptane and cyclohexane), alkenes (2-methyl-hexene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene), terpenes (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and naphthalene) and sulphur compounds (dimethyl disulfide, carbon bisulfide and dimethyl sulfide) (see Table 4 ). High amounts of VOCs (alkanes and alkylated benzenes) emitted from MSW biostabilization process indicating that these compounds could be a result of decomposition (Komilis et al., 2004). Alkanes (heptane, octane, nonane and n-decane) concentrations reached the maximum value of 60.27\u03bcgheptanem\u22123, 79.56\u03bcgoctanem\u22123, 665.53\u03bcgnonanem\u22123 and 1060.96\u03bcg n-decanem\u22123 at the beginning of ventilation and then decreased with time during the study.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 2-methyl-1-hexene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). They are part of a broader analysis of various chemical compounds released during this process, categorized under alkylated benzenes and alkenes, respectively. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and 2-methyl-1-hexene beyond their classification as VOCs in the same study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and 2-methyl-1-hexene are mentioned together in the context of VOC emissions from MSW biostabilization, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating only a shared category without direct interaction.",
