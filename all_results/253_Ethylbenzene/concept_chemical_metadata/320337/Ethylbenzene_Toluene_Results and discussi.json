Hexane and cyclohexane attained peak concentration of 64.63 and 53.92\u03bcgm\u22123 at 6th day and then decreased. Methyl-cyclohexane was measured in relatively low concentrations of no higher than 3.87\u03bcgm\u22123 during the entire composting process. MSWs biostabilization process emitted relatively high concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, ethyltoluene, at the range of 73.84\u2013728.23\u03bcgtoluenem\u22123, 1190.67\u20134587.43\u03bcgethylbenzenem\u22123, 1973.25\u20138099.69\u03bcgxylenem\u22123 and 84.58\u2013917.22\u03bcgethyltoluenem\u22123, ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization process of municipal solid waste (MSW). The study reports their concentration ranges, indicating that both compounds are significant components of the emissions. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their presence in the same emission profile.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as VOCs emitted during the same process, but their relationship is not explored in detail, indicating a general connection rather than a specific interaction.",
