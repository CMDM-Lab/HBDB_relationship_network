    "context": "[6] Sixty eight asthmatic children (77%) had at least one parent with an allergic problem and 57% had at least one asthmatic parent. [7] More cases than controls reported having wheeze, runny nose, and cough (p<0.01, [8] table 1). [1] The VOCs identified in the homes of participants included benzene, toluene, m-xylene, o,p-xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, chlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, with toluene, xylene, and benzene + toluene being detected in 99% of the homes studied, xylene in 93%, and benzene in 86%. [2] The highest median concentration was measured for benzene (20.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 with a maximum of 81.9 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3) followed by toluene (17.1 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (range 0.01\u00e2\u20ac\u201c153.9)) [3] and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (16.7 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (range 0.01\u00e2\u20ac\u201c201.8)). [4] The median concentration of total VOCs was 54.9 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 with a maximum of 622 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 measured in a house in which the walls of the living room had been recently painted. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the homes of asthmatic children. They are part of a broader list of VOCs detected, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions, health effects, or comparative significance in relation to asthma or allergic problems. Their mention is purely coincidental within the context of VOC exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene are both listed as VOCs found in the same study, indicating they share a general category but lack a detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions.",
        "score": 2
