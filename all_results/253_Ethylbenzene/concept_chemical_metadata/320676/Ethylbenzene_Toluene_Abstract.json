    "context": "[3] Information regarding the health status of the study children and characteristics of the home was collected using a standardised questionnaire. [4] Exposure to VOCs, average temperature and relative humidity were measured in winter and summer in the living room of each participating household. [1] Results: Cases were exposed to significantly higher VOC levels (\u00ce\u00bcg/m3) than controls (p<0.01). [2] Most of the individual VOCs appeared to be significant risk factors for asthma with the highest odds ratios for benzene followed by ethylbenzene and toluene. [3] For every 10 unit increase in the concentration of toluene and benzene (\u00ce\u00bcg/m3) the risk of having asthma increased by almost two and three times, respectively. [1] Conclusions: Domestic exposure to VOCs at levels below currently accepted recommendations may increase the risk of childhood asthma. [2] Measurement of total VOCs may underestimate the risks associated with individual compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are significant risk factors for asthma in children. The study indicates that higher concentrations of these compounds correlate with increased asthma risk, with toluene showing a notable odds ratio for asthma development. This suggests a direct relationship between exposure to these VOCs and respiratory health outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and toluene as both are implicated as significant risk factors for asthma, supported by statistical data showing their impact on health. Their relationship is clearly established in the context of VOC exposure and asthma risk.",
