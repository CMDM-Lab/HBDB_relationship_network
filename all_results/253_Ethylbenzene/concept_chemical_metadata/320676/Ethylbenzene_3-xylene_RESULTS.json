    "context": "[6] Sixty eight asthmatic children (77%) had at least one parent with an allergic problem and 57% had at least one asthmatic parent. [7] More cases than controls reported having wheeze, runny nose, and cough (p<0.01, [8] table 1). [1] The VOCs identified in the homes of participants included benzene, toluene, m-xylene, o,p-xylene, ethylbenzene, styrene, chlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, with toluene, xylene, and benzene + toluene being detected in 99% of the homes studied, xylene in 93%, and benzene in 86%. [2] The highest median concentration was measured for benzene (20.3 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 with a maximum of 81.9 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3) followed by toluene (17.1 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (range 0.01\u00e2\u20ac\u201c153.9)) [3] and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (16.7 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (range 0.01\u00e2\u20ac\u201c201.8)). [4] The median concentration of total VOCs was 54.9 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 with a maximum of 622 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 measured in a house in which the walls of the living room had been recently painted. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the homes of asthmatic children. They are part of a broader analysis of VOC exposure, but the context does not provide specific details on their individual effects or interactions. Their mention indicates they are part of the same environmental exposure study, but no direct relationship is established between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are mentioned together as VOCs found in homes, indicating a shared category of compounds. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or significance in relation to asthma or each other.",
        "score": 2
