    "context": "[1] The ORs were adjusted for the effects of relative humidity and indoor temperature. [2] Other potential confounding factors such as child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age, sex, child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allergy, family history of asthma, socioeconomic status, smoking indoors, season, air conditioning, house dust mites, and gas appliances were also considered in the analysis. [3] Having controlled for these potential confounding variables, children exposed to concentrations of total VOCs of \u00e2\u00a9\u00be60 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (median level of exposure) had a fourfold increased risk of having asthma while children exposed to single compounds such as benzene at levels of \u00e2\u00a9\u00be20 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (median level of exposure) had an eightfold increased risk of asthma (fig 2). [1] Most of the individual VOCs appeared to be significant risk factors for asthma with the highest ORs for benzene followed by ethylbenzene and toluene (fig 3). [2] For every 10 unit increase in the concentrations of toluene and benzene (\u00ce\u00bcg/m3) the risk of having asthma increased by almost two and three times, respectively.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as significant risk factors for asthma in children exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights that increased concentrations of these compounds correlate with a higher risk of developing asthma, with toluene showing a notable increase in risk for every 10 \u00b5g/m3 increase in concentration. Both compounds are part of the broader category of VOCs that contribute to respiratory health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and toluene as both are identified as significant risk factors for asthma, supported by quantitative data showing their impact on asthma risk in children. Their relationship is clearly established within the context of VOC exposure.",
