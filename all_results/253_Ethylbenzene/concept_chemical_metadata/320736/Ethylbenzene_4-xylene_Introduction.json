    "context": "Everyday, more than 5 million passenger journeys are made on the public transportation system. The number of public transportation trips has increased sharply and continuously since the early 1990s. Most commuters are required to spend 1\u20132 h in their daily commutes. As there is limited information on in-vehicle VOC exposure data in the study area, the primary aim of this study is to compare the exposure levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene in four popular public transportation modes while commuting in the urban area of Guangzhou. The target compounds are strongly associated with vehicle use and are commonly known as vehicle emission markers (Chan et al., 1991). Four popular public transportation modes, which are subway, taxis, non-air-conditioned buses and air-conditioned buses, were selected in this study for aromatic VOCs measurement. These four commuting modes together served more than 85% of the total public transportation journeys in year 2000. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with vehicle emissions, specifically in the study of exposure levels during public transportation commutes in Guangzhou. They are part of a group of aromatic VOCs measured to assess commuter exposure, indicating their relevance as markers of vehicular pollution. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their shared categorization as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both identified as VOCs related to vehicle emissions in the same study. However, their relationship is not explored in detail, indicating a general connection rather than a significant interaction.",
        "score": 2
