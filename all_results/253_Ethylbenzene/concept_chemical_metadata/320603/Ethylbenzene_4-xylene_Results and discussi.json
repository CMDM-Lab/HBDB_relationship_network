    "context": "This observation result indicates that VOCs measured along the boundary of the industrial park should be considered a blend concentration associated with nearby land use, traffic density, site type and industrial activities.Xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratio The study used the xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratio to assess the relative age of the air parcels. X/E ratio ranged from 1.5 to 260, from 0.6 to 2.9, from 1.1 to 2.9, from 1.5 to 2.9, from 1.5 to 2.6 and from 1.3 to 3.4 in Nei-Pu, Ping-Tung, Ping-Nan, Ren-Wu, Lin-Yuan and Nan-Zi industrial park neighborhoods, respectively. In Nei-Pu, the maximum X/E ratio was 260 because of the release of metal and printing solvent upwind during the sampling day. The average X/E ratios, namely (m,p-xylene+ o-xylene)/ethylbenzene ratios, in Nei-Pu, Ping-Tung, Ping-Nan, Ren-Wu, Lin-Yuan and Nan-Zi were 7.4, 2.2, 2.7, 2.9, 3.3 and 3.8, respectively. The concentrations of MTBE and BTEX in the atmosphere of the six different industrial park neighborhoods were mainly influenced by direct emissions from various industrial sources within the parks, fuel evaporation, photochemical reactions and small quantities of vehicles emissions. The comparison of the X/E ratios in the six different sampling neighborhoods suggested there is the situation about the photochemical reactivity of xylenes. The average X/E ratio (7.4) in Nei-Pu exceeded that in the other five sampling sites (average values from 2.2 to 3.8). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are analyzed as part of the xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratio used to assess the relative age of air parcels in industrial park neighborhoods. The study indicates that the X/E ratio varies significantly across different locations, suggesting that both compounds are influenced by similar industrial emissions and environmental factors. However, the specific interaction or functional relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the X/E ratio analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both part of the X/E ratio analysis, indicating a shared significance in assessing air quality. However, their direct relationship or interaction is not deeply explored in the context.",
