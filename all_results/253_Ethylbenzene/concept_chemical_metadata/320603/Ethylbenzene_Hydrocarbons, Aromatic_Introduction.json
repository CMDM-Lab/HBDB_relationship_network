    "context": "The presence of MTBE in fuel is also associated with increased emissions of its by-products, especially formaldehyde. In Taiwan, MTBE is blended into gasoline in ratio of up to 11% by volume to improve the oxygen content. MTBE is added to gasoline in Taiwan not because of clean air related laws, but rather to increase octane values. Other common VOCs, including aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene (BTEX), are widely used in industry and exert serious adverse effects on environmental air quality. BTEX are frequently produced from industrial sources, including printing and laminating facilities, foundries, electronics, and paint manufacturing units. Especially, BTEX frequently occur together at hazardous waste sites. Public health risks from exposure to either MTBE or BTEX are best assessed via an approach that considers both the mechanism and toxic consequences of the joint action of the whole mixture, particularly the presence or absence of interactions that affect the responses of the critical target-organs.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) that are commonly produced from industrial activities and contribute to environmental air quality issues. The mention of ethylbenzene alongside other aromatic hydrocarbons highlights its classification within this group, indicating shared characteristics and potential health risks associated with exposure to these compounds. However, the context does not delve into specific interactions or unique properties of ethylbenzene compared to other aromatic hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is categorized as an aromatic hydrocarbon and is discussed in relation to environmental and health impacts. However, the context lacks detailed exploration of its specific interactions or unique significance within the group of aromatic hydrocarbons.",
        "score": 3
