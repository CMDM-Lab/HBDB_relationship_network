    "context": "As far as ambient air legislations are concerned, the Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) of the United Kingdom has recommended an ambient air standard of 16\u03bcg/m3 as an annual rolling mean for benzene. A short-term (30min) ambient air quality standard of 30\u03bcg/m3 for benzene has been established in Texas, USA. Differentiating between different pollution sources is difficult for samples taken from ambient air, and so it is difficult to forecast the true influence of different emission sources. However, toluene/benzene (T/B) or xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratios can clarify the characteristics of BTEX emission. Nelson and Quigley demonstrated that the ratio between (m + p)-xylene and ethylbenzene (X/E) can indicate the extent of atmospheric photochemical reactivity. Subsequently, Monod et al. identified the X/E ratio as a useful tool for estimating the photochemical age of air mass and confirmed this method proposed by Nelson and Quigley. Recently, Hsieh and Tsai noted that the species ratios (T/B and X/B) were useful tools for estimating the photochemical age of air mass and confirmed the method proposed by Nelson and Quigley and Monod et al.. Xylenes are considered a highly reactive species while ethylbenzene is considered a low reactivity species. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in relation to their roles in ambient air quality and pollution source differentiation. The Toluene/Benzene (T/B) and Xylene/Ethylbenzene (X/E) ratios are highlighted as analytical tools for assessing the photochemical reactivity and age of air masses. Ethylbenzene is characterized as a low reactivity species, while toluene is part of the more reactive BTEX group, indicating their differing roles in atmospheric chemistry and pollution dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are analyzed in the context of air quality standards and their ratios are used to assess photochemical reactivity. Their relationship is supported by evidence from studies that utilize these ratios for environmental assessments.",
        "score": 4
