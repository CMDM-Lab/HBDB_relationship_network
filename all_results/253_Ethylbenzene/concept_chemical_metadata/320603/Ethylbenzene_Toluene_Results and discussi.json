    "context": "The number of factors extracted depended on the eigen value (>1.000). For the measured data, the three factors explained 86.30% of the common variance in the data set. The first factor (Factor-1) explained approximately 49.22% of the variance, while the second factor (Factor-2) and third factor (Factor-3) explained approximately 19.75 and 17.33%, respectively, of the variance. Among the measured VOCs, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes had the highest loadings (>0.6) for the first factor. The second and third factors comprised of MTBE and benzene with high factor loadings, respectively. This PCA result is expected based on general chemical knowledge. Owing to ambient conditions in the troposphere, MTBE reacts with OH radicals (usually at the methoxy side of the MTBE molecule) to form primarily tert-butyl formate (TBF) and formaldehyde, with smaller amounts of benzene (minor product) or without the formation of TEX.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit high loadings in a principal component analysis (PCA) of measured data. They are grouped together in the analysis, indicating a shared variance in their behavior or properties within the dataset. However, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their statistical association in the PCA results.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are statistically related through PCA, indicating they share common characteristics as VOCs. However, the lack of detailed discussion on their direct interactions or implications limits the strength of their relationship.",
