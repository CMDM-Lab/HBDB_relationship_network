    "context": "A short-term (30min) ambient air quality standard of 30\u03bcg/m3 for benzene has been established in Texas, USA. Differentiating between different pollution sources is difficult for samples taken from ambient air, and so it is difficult to forecast the true influence of different emission sources. However, toluene/benzene (T/B) or xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratios can clarify the characteristics of BTEX emission. Nelson and Quigley demonstrated that the ratio between (m + p)-xylene and ethylbenzene (X/E) can indicate the extent of atmospheric photochemical reactivity. Subsequently, Monod et al. identified the X/E ratio as a useful tool for estimating the photochemical age of air mass and confirmed this method proposed by Nelson and Quigley. Recently, Hsieh and Tsai noted that the species ratios (T/B and X/B) were useful tools for estimating the photochemical age of air mass and confirmed the method proposed by Nelson and Quigley and Monod et al.. Xylenes are considered a highly reactive species while ethylbenzene is considered a low reactivity species. Low X/E ratio suggests an aged air parcel. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are discussed in relation to their ratios (X/E) as indicators of atmospheric photochemical reactivity and air mass age. The X/E ratio helps differentiate between pollution sources and assess the reactivity of air samples, with xylenes being more reactive than ethylbenzene. This relationship highlights the importance of these compounds in environmental monitoring and air quality assessment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene, as their ratio is used to assess atmospheric reactivity and pollution characteristics. The context provides evidence of their relevance in environmental studies, indicating a clear relationship supported by the methodology discussed.",
