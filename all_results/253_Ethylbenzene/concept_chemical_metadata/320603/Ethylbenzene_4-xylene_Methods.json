    "context": "The established calibration curves for the six investigated VOCs were found to have R-square-values >0.996. Seven replicate analyses were performed on a sample, using the lowest previously specified concentrations for establishing calibration curves for the five VOCs. The resultant standard deviation (STD) for each VOC compound was used to estimate its method detection limit (that is, MDL=3\u00d7STD). The analytical results displayed that the MDLs for the five VOC compounds of the MTBE, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and m/p-xylene and o-xylene were 1.25, 0.38, 1.024, 0.833, 0.404 and 0.404\u03bcg/m3, respectively. Three replicate analyses were performed on each of the three samples with known specified concentrations, and the relative standard deviations (R.S.D.s) thus obtained were employed to assess the accuracy of the method. MTBE and BTEX concentrations Six different industrial park neighborhoods (Nei-Pu, Ping-Tung, Ping-Nan, Ren-Wu, Lin-Yuan and Nan-Zi) were selected to represent the food processing, machine manufacturing, iron and steel, general manufacturing, special oil and petroleum, and petrochemical industries, respectively. Table 1 lists the measured basic meteorological condition in six different sampling sites. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their method detection limits (MDLs) in a study involving calibration curves. They are part of a group of VOCs assessed for accuracy in analytical methods, but no specific interaction or relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is discussed beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both part of the same group of VOCs being analyzed, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relationship in the context provided.",
