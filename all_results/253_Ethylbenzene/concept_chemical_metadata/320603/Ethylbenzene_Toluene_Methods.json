    "context": "The established calibration curves for the six investigated VOCs were found to have R-square-values >0.996. Seven replicate analyses were performed on a sample, using the lowest previously specified concentrations for establishing calibration curves for the five VOCs. The resultant standard deviation (STD) for each VOC compound was used to estimate its method detection limit (that is, MDL=3\u00d7STD). The analytical results displayed that the MDLs for the five VOC compounds of the MTBE, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and m/p-xylene and o-xylene were 1.25, 0.38, 1.024, 0.833, 0.404 and 0.404\u03bcg/m3, respectively. Three replicate analyses were performed on each of the three samples with known specified concentrations, and the relative standard deviations (R.S.D.s) thus obtained were employed to assess the accuracy of the method. MTBE and BTEX concentrations Six different industrial park neighborhoods (Nei-Pu, Ping-Tung, Ping-Nan, Ren-Wu, Lin-Yuan and Nan-Zi) were selected to represent the food processing, machine manufacturing, iron and steel, general manufacturing, special oil and petroleum, and petrochemical industries, respectively. Table 1 lists the measured basic meteorological condition in six different sampling sites. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their method detection limits (MDLs) in various industrial settings. They are part of a group of compounds (BTEX) that are commonly monitored due to their environmental and health impacts. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs and their inclusion in calibration curves for analytical methods.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both categorized as VOCs and included in the same analytical study, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interactions.",
