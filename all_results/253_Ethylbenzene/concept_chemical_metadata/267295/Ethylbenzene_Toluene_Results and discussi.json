    "context": "In this study, most of the odor concentration at the boundaries of plastic recycling plants exceeded Taiwan EPA standards, particularly melting and powdering plants, which indicated the need for improved odor control.VOCs and odor concentration inside the PVC, PE and PP plastic waste recycling plants Thirty-seven volatile compounds including chlorinated compounds, hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aldehydes and organic nitriles were detected in the indoor air sampled from the PVC plastic waste recycling plant (Table 3 ). In particular of the harmful chlorinated compounds, sixteen chemicals were detectable at total concentrations of 245\u2013553\u03bcgm\u22123; most of which were vinyl chloride, chloroform and trichloroethylene. The concentrations of toluene, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, methyl methacrylate and acrolein were the highest respective hydrocarbons, ketones, esters and aldehydes with values of 1 019\u20138 199\u03bcgm\u22123, 1 517\u201311 324\u03bcgm\u22123, 1 128\u20132 440\u03bcgm\u22123 and 46\u2013259\u03bcgm\u22123, respectively. Referring to the olfactory threshold of the individual compound (Devos et al., 1990), toluene, ethylbenzene, 4-methyl-2-pentanone and methyl methacrylate exceeded human olfactory thresholds, and this indicated these compounds played the key roles to contribute the odor inside PVC plastic waste recycling plant. Of the indoor air samples from PE production lines in the PE/PP plastic waste recycling plants, toluene, acetone, 2-butanone, formaldehyde and acrolein were the higher level compounds respective hydrocarbons, ketones and aldehydes with values of 114\u2013314\u03bcgm\u22123, 93\u2013431\u03bcgm\u22123, 34\u2013219\u03bcgm\u22123, 49\u2013282\u03bcgm\u22123 and 15\u2013847\u03bcgm\u22123, respectively. Most concentrations of esters, chlorinated compounds and organic nitriles were less than 100\u03bcgm\u22123 (Table 4 ). Of the emissions from PP production lines, toluene was still the highest respective hydrocarbons with values of 220\u2013374\u03bcgm\u22123, but acetone with high concentration of 4 552\u03bcgm\u22123 was detected in one sample (Table 4).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the indoor air of plastic recycling plants. They are mentioned alongside other compounds that exceed olfactory thresholds, indicating their significant contribution to the odor in these environments. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not explicitly detailed beyond their shared presence as VOCs contributing to odor issues.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as they are both categorized as VOCs contributing to odor in the recycling plants. However, there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship discussed between the two compounds.",
