    "context": "Notably, the proportions of the oxidative compounds generated from the PE/PP and PVC production lines were more than 50% of the total VOCs and these could contribute the unpleasant smells. The high amount of aromatic hydrocarbons and oxidative compounds might be not only from the polymer degradation and additives but also from the volatile contaminants, such as print ink. Several VOCs which were not originated from the virgin resins could be measured in the sampled plants and these could be explained to the unseparated plastic waste. For examples, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene and styrene could be detected in the indoor air emitted from the PVC production lines (Table 3) and these could be generated from the unseparated poly (acrylonitrile\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene) plastic waste, and chlorinated hydrocarbons could be detected in the indoor air inside the PE/PP plastic recycling plants (Table 4) and these could be from the unseparated PVC plastic waste. Moreover, bromomethane could be measured in the emission from the PP production line, and this could be generated from the additive of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in PP plastic products, as BFRs, particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers, have become of increasing concern for the adverse effects upon the environment and bio-species over the past decade (de Wit, 2002). Therefore, more complicated and hazardous compounds could be released into the work and ambient environment from the present melting operation in plastic waste recycling plants.PAHs concentrations in the PE/PP plastic waste recycling plant Particle-bound PAHs are generally more toxic (Beak et al., 1991; Chang et al., 2006). Table 5 shows the analytical results of PAHs inside and outside the largest PE/PP plastic waste recycling plant. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and butadiene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the indoor air of plastic production and recycling facilities. However, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between ethylbenzene and butadiene, merely listing them among other VOCs generated from plastic waste. Their presence is noted in the context of environmental emissions, but no specific connection or comparative analysis is made.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and butadiene are both identified as VOCs in the same context related to plastic production, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond their co-occurrence.",
        "score": 2
