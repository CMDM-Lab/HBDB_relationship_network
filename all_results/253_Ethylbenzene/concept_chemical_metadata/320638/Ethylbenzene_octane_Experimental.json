    "context": "In this manuscript, the concept of the in-needle trap was applied to develop a sorbent packed NT device. Also, different approaches were carefully evaluated for the transfer of enriched components in to the analytical instrument. In addition, applications of the NT device for exhaustive extraction and passive TWA sampling are discussed. Chemicals and materials The n-alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane and n-undecane) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Mississauga, Canada). Needles and syringes were obtained from Hamilton (Reno, NV, USA). SPME fibre coatings, narrow-neck liners and gas-sampling bulb (1L) were purchased from Supelco (Mississauga, Canada). Segmental needle trap filled with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), divinylbenzene (DVB) and Carboxen particles was from Restek (Bellefonte, PA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and octane are both mentioned as part of a list of chemicals obtained for use in developing a sorbent packed needle trap (NT) device. They are categorized under BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene) and n-alkanes (including n-octane). However, there is no discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships within the context of the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as ethylbenzene and octane are simply listed together among other chemicals without any direct interaction or relevance discussed in the context.",
