    "context": "In this manuscript, the concept of the in-needle trap was applied to develop a sorbent packed NT device. Also, different approaches were carefully evaluated for the transfer of enriched components in to the analytical instrument. In addition, applications of the NT device for exhaustive extraction and passive TWA sampling are discussed. Chemicals and materials The n-alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane and n-undecane) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Mississauga, Canada). Needles and syringes were obtained from Hamilton (Reno, NV, USA). SPME fibre coatings, narrow-neck liners and gas-sampling bulb (1L) were purchased from Supelco (Mississauga, Canada). Segmental needle trap filled with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), divinylbenzene (DVB) and Carboxen particles was from Restek (Bellefonte, PA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. They are included in a discussion about the development of a sorbent packed needle trap device for sampling and extraction. However, there is no detailed exploration of their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as VOCs in the context of sampling methods, but there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions or specific roles in the study.",
