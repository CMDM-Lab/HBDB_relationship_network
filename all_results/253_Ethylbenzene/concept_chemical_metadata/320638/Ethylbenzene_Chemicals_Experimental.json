    "context": "In this manuscript, the concept of the in-needle trap was applied to develop a sorbent packed NT device. Also, different approaches were carefully evaluated for the transfer of enriched components in to the analytical instrument. In addition, applications of the NT device for exhaustive extraction and passive TWA sampling are discussed. Chemicals and materials The n-alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane and n-undecane) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Mississauga, Canada). Needles and syringes were obtained from Hamilton (Reno, NV, USA). SPME fibre coatings, narrow-neck liners and gas-sampling bulb (1L) were purchased from Supelco (Mississauga, Canada). Segmental needle trap filled with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), divinylbenzene (DVB) and Carboxen particles was from Restek (Bellefonte, PA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as part of a group of chemicals known as BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene) that were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The reference to ethylbenzene is incidental, as it is listed among other chemicals without any specific discussion of its properties, functions, or interactions within the context of the study. Thus, the relationship is primarily categorical, identifying ethylbenzene as one of the chemicals used in the research.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene is simply categorized with other chemicals without any detailed discussion of its specific role or interactions in the context provided.",
        "score": 2
