    "context": "Obviously, for C6\u2013C8 n-aldehydes the interaction with silica surface appear to be energetically more favorable than for long chain aldehydes and BTEX. The largest decrease in the KP values among BTEX were observed for ethylbenzene and o-xylene (a factor of 1.5). In the presence of urban aerosol particles in the working solution the KP values lay for all compounds between those observed in the presence of diesel soot and mineral dust. The absolute amount of analyte in the air decreased from 10% for toluene and benzene up to 20% for m/p xylene and ethylbenzene. The absolute amount of n-hexanal, n-nonanal and n-octanal decreased insignificantly (nearly 2%). The long chain aldehydes exhibited a slight decrease in the absolute amount values by 5\u201310% for n-nonanal and n-decanal, respectively. The lowest KP values were measured for n-hexanal and n-heptanal, the highest values were measured for toluene and benzene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) group, which are volatile organic compounds. The study discusses their interactions with silica surfaces and the impact of urban aerosol particles on their presence in the air. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not explicitly detailed beyond their classification as BTEX compounds, indicating a shared category but lacking direct interaction or comparative analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both part of the BTEX group and mentioned in the same context regarding their interactions with silica surfaces. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
