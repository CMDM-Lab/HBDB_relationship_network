    "context": "According to Arp et al. (2008) the interfacial interaction between the organic compounds, minerals and diesel soot obeys an adsorption mechanism. An adsorption extent of a given compound and a specific surface depends on the surface area and the affinity between the surface and the compound. Thus, the low energy hydrophobic diesel soot interface attracts more molecules of BTEX and long chain aldehydes than high energy hydrophilic mineral dust interface or water surface. As a result in the presence of soot particles the absolute amount of analyte in the air decrease from 10% for toluene, benzene, n-nonanal up to 26% for ethylbenzene. This will lead to a decrease in the partition coefficient values by a factor of 1.5\u20133.0, depending upon the compound (Table 2). The addition of mineral dust into the working solution exhibited greater influence on the partitioning of short aldehydes and led to a decrease in the KP values by factors of 1.6\u20131.8 for n-hexanal and n-heptanal respectively.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and nonanal are discussed in relation to their adsorption behavior on different surfaces, particularly in the presence of diesel soot. Ethylbenzene is noted to have a significant decrease in its presence in the air due to adsorption, while nonanal is mentioned as part of the broader category of long-chain aldehydes. However, the specific interaction or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and nonanal is not elaborated upon, indicating a more general relationship based on their adsorption characteristics rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and nonanal, as both are mentioned in the context of adsorption mechanisms but lack detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
