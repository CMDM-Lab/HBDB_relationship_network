    "context": "This paper presents laboratory experiments on the partition processes of aromatic hydrocarbons and C6\u2013C10 n-aldehydes between air, aqueous solution and solid materials of different chemical composition (Sahara dust, diesel soot and urban aerosol particles) added to the solution. The selected organic compounds were previously detected in field snow samples (Fries et al., 2008; Sieg et al., 2008). Chemicals Two stock standard solutions (Neochema, Germany) were prepared in methanol containing 200mgL\u22121 of each analyte. One solution was composed of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene and p-xylene) and the other one of C6\u2013C10 n-aldehydes. From these two stock standard solutions one working standard solution was prepared by dilution of the stock standard solution with ultrapure water (membraPure, Bodenheim, Germany) to a final concentration of 500\u03bcgL\u22121 for each compound. Working standard solutions were freshly prepared every 2weeks. Diesel soot was purchased from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2009) sold as Standard Reference Material 2975, Diesel Particulate Matter (Industrial Forklift).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both included in a stock standard solution of BTEX compounds, which are aromatic hydrocarbons. They are mentioned together as part of a laboratory experiment focused on the partition processes of these compounds in various environmental matrices. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their inclusion in the same solution.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as part of the BTEX compounds in the study, indicating they share a general category but lack a detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
