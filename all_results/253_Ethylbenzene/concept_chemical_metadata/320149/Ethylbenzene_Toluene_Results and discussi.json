    "context": "Obviously, for C6\u2013C8 n-aldehydes the interaction with silica surface appear to be energetically more favorable than for long chain aldehydes and BTEX. The largest decrease in the KP values among BTEX were observed for ethylbenzene and o-xylene (a factor of 1.5). In the presence of urban aerosol particles in the working solution the KP values lay for all compounds between those observed in the presence of diesel soot and mineral dust. The absolute amount of analyte in the air decreased from 10% for toluene and benzene up to 20% for m/p xylene and ethylbenzene. The absolute amount of n-hexanal, n-nonanal and n-octanal decreased insignificantly (nearly 2%). The long chain aldehydes exhibited a slight decrease in the absolute amount values by 5\u201310% for n-nonanal and n-decanal, respectively. The lowest KP values were measured for n-hexanal and n-heptanal, the highest values were measured for toluene and benzene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX group, which refers to a class of volatile organic compounds. The study discusses their interactions with silica surfaces and their relative amounts in the air, indicating that both compounds are analyzed for their environmental behavior. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not deeply explored beyond their classification as BTEX compounds and their comparative decrease in air concentration.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX group and are discussed in relation to their environmental interactions, but there is no detailed examination of their direct relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
