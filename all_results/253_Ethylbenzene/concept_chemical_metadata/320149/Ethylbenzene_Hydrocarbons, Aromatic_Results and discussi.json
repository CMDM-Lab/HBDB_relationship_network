    "context": "The fraction of molecules that remains in the solution can partition between water to air phase. Thus, two analyte fluxes in the water-to-air and water-to-solid directions will be formed. The solution\u2013solid and solution\u2013air distribution processes operate simultaneously and the intensity of the compound fluxes depends on chemical nature of organic substances and of solid materials. Aromatic hydrocarbons of very low polarity (such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) cannot form the strong hydrogen bridge bonds with water molecules. Therefore BTEX tend to escape from the aqueous solution. The aldehydes have a polar functional group (carbonyl group) and can react with water forming diols, which are accessible for hydrogen bonds. The hydration is more important for short chain n-aldehydes and decreases with chain length. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as an aromatic hydrocarbon, part of the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). The text discusses the behavior of aromatic hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene, in aqueous solutions, highlighting their low polarity and tendency to escape from water due to their inability to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This establishes a clear classification of ethylbenzene within the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and aromatic hydrocarbons, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as part of the BTEX group and discussed in relation to their chemical properties and behavior in solutions.",
        "score": 4
