    "context": "This paper presents laboratory experiments on the partition processes of aromatic hydrocarbons and C6\u2013C10 n-aldehydes between air, aqueous solution and solid materials of different chemical composition (Sahara dust, diesel soot and urban aerosol particles) added to the solution. The selected organic compounds were previously detected in field snow samples (Fries et al., 2008; Sieg et al., 2008). Chemicals Two stock standard solutions (Neochema, Germany) were prepared in methanol containing 200mgL\u22121 of each analyte. One solution was composed of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene and p-xylene) and the other one of C6\u2013C10 n-aldehydes. From these two stock standard solutions one working standard solution was prepared by dilution of the stock standard solution with ultrapure water (membraPure, Bodenheim, Germany) to a final concentration of 500\u03bcgL\u22121 for each compound. Working standard solutions were freshly prepared every 2weeks. Diesel soot was purchased from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, 2009) sold as Standard Reference Material 2975, Diesel Particulate Matter (Industrial Forklift).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both part of a group of aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) analyzed in laboratory experiments concerning their partition processes between air, aqueous solutions, and solid materials. They are included in a standard solution prepared for the study, indicating they are relevant to the same chemical analysis but without a specific interaction or relationship detailed between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are mentioned together in the context of a study on aromatic hydrocarbons, but their relationship is not explored in detail beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework.",
        "score": 2
