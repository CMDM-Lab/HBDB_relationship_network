    "context": "It is noteworthy that the in-vehicle limonene concentrations would not reflect the total amount emitted from the AFs, since certain amounts of emitted limonene can be consumed by a reaction with ozone (Weschler and Shields, 1999; Wainman et al., 2000; Destallats et al., 2006), which penetrated the interior of the vehicles. Other possible confounding parameters include adsorption, condensation, and inhalation by the technicians present in the car during sampling. For other aromatic target compounds, there were no significant differences between the two conditions tested. Although an ANOVA for the concentrations of ethyl benzene and toluene in the diesel-fueled cars exhibited significant differences, such discrepancies are likely due to experimental errors, when considering a standard deviation of more than 50%. Consequently, it was suggested that unlike limonene, the emission strength of the aromatic compounds identified in the chamber tests was not strong enough to elevate in-vehicle levels. Since aromatic compounds are markers of vehicle emissions, their in-vehicle levels are primarily influenced by the penetration from roadway air (Jo and Park, 1999). As such, it is likely that the effect of roadway air exceeded the effect of AFs emission regarding in-vehicle levels. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as aromatic compounds associated with vehicle emissions. The study notes significant differences in their concentrations in diesel-fueled cars, although these discrepancies may be attributed to experimental errors. Both compounds serve as markers for vehicle emissions, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon beyond their shared classification as aromatic compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of vehicle emissions, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds. However, there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interaction.",
