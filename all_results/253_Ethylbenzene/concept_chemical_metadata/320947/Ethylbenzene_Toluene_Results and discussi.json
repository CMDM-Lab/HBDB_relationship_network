    "context": "The total BTEX concentration ranged from 28.7 to 65.4ppmv in the raw biogas, and from BLD to 2.1ppmv in the emitted biogas. Results of the RE to reduce VOC emissions are given in Table 2 . The RE in reducing biogas emissions ranged from 67 to nearly 100% for BTEX, and from 96% to 97% for OVOCs. The associated EC ranged from 0.5 to 0.9, from 0.1 to 0.5 and from 0.7 to 1.2mgm\u22123 h\u22121 for toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, respectively. For OVOC, EC was in the range of 0.9\u20131.9mgm\u22123 h\u22121. The high rates of RE to reduce VOC emissions obtained can be influenced by a number of factors such as: (i) the moisture and the temperature in the biocover, (ii) the soil pH (Lu et al., 2002), and (iii) the organic nutrients available in the biocover soil (Lu et al., 2002).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of the BTEX group, which is analyzed for its concentration in biogas emissions. The study reports on the reduction efficiency (RE) of VOC emissions, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the context of environmental monitoring and reduction strategies for VOCs. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not detailed beyond their inclusion in the same analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of BTEX in the context of VOC emissions reduction. They share a common category and are analyzed together, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
