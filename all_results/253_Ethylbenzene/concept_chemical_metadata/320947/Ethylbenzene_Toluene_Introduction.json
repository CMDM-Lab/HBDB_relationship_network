    "context": "This index can be used for identification of suitable plants for treating VOC-contaminated air. Landfill biogas (LFG) is produced under anaerobic conditions by the biodegradation of the waste materials (Chiriac et al., 2007). The composition of LFG varies significantly both spatially and temporally but generally includes 40\u201345vol% CO2, 55\u201365vol% CH4, and minor quantities of organic alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds, sulfur compounds, etc. LFG typically includes numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Durmusoglu et al., 2010; Rasi et al., 2011), which are formed in landfills as intermediary or final products of microbial or abiotic degradation processes (Chiriac et al., 2007; Rasi et al., 2011). Common VOCs found in LFG are benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene isomers (Durmusoglu et al., 2010), commonly referred as BTEX. The BTEX compounds form an important group of VOCs because of their deleterious effect on the tropospheric chemistry and due to their neurotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic properties (Allen et al., 1997; Durmusoglu et al., 2010). The VOC concentrations in LFG range from 0.2 to 4500mgm\u22123 and their concentration range depends on the age, quantity, quality and origin of the waste \u2013 which can vary from one landfill cell to another, as well as on the climatic conditions prevailing in the area where the landfill is installed (Durmusoglu et al., 2010). One promising biotechnology to attenuate landfill surface emissions is to install a biocover over the site (Hrad et al., 2012). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in landfill biogas (LFG). They are part of the BTEX group, which is significant due to its harmful effects on the environment and human health. The mention of both compounds highlights their shared relevance in discussions about VOC contamination and the need for effective treatment methods, but no specific interaction or comparative analysis between them is provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both categorized as VOCs in the BTEX group, indicating their shared significance in environmental health. However, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or roles beyond their inclusion in the same group.",
