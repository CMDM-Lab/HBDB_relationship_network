    "context": "For the identification and the quantification of VOCs, a GC\u2013MS (G1800A, Hewlett\u2013Packard, Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) equipped with an electron ionization detector and an HP-5 MS fused-silica column (30m X 0.25mm id., 0.25mm film thickness, Hewlett\u2013Packard, Agilent Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) was used. The analyses were conducted in full-scan mode over an m/z range of 50\u2013450amu. Calibration curves were prepared from 5 concentrations for each BTEX compound, each time using triplicates. The detection limit was (in ppbv): 1.8, 38.1, 4.1 and 24.5 for benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene, respectively. The total BTEX and the other volatile organic compound (OVOC) concentrations were expressed in terms of \u201ctoluene-equivalent\u201d (Chiriac et al., 2011). The performances of the biocover were evaluated in terms of BTEX and OVOC removal efficiency (RE, %) and its associated elimination capacity (EC, gm\u22123 h\u22121). The BTEX concentrations in the raw biogas ranged from below the limit of detection (BLD) to 21.9ppmv (Table 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for their quantification and identification. The study focuses on the detection limits and calibration of these compounds as part of a broader analysis of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) concentrations in biogas. While they are mentioned together in the context of VOC analysis, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and toluene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX group analyzed in the study, but their relationship is not explored beyond their inclusion in the same analytical method.",
