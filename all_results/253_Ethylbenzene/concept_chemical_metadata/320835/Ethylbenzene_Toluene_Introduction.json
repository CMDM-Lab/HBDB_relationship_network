    "context": "In this paper, we have tried to perform a systematic investigation by selecting experimental conditions which are found in the different zones of an electric arc oven (Fig. 1). The conditions can be considered as limiting cases and there are of course a large number of zones in which the experimental conditions are intermediary. In an electric furnace, which is a batch reactor, a large range of atmospheres and temperatures varying according to time and space is observed (Arion, 1998) which can be classified as follows: &#x02022; near the injection nozzles and the furnace openings, at the beginning of the melting process, the gas phase can be represented by air and the temperatures range from 300\u00b0C to 600\u00b0C; &#x02022; between the electrodes and the furnace walls, the gas phase can be represented either by air or by N2/CO2 (60/40 v/v) and the temperatures range from 900\u00b0C to 1100\u00b0C; &#x02022; near the steel bath, i.e., at the end of the melting process, the temperature is about 1500\u00b0C and the atmosphere is either air or a mixture of CO2/CO. It is not possible to carry out a detailed investigation in a large scale electric arc furnace (even in a pilot plant) because this work aims at studying the influence of temperature and composition of the furnace atmosphere and also to determine the mechanism of formation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) and polyaromatic compounds (PAHs) which are in very small amounts. Such an investigation requires well-defined conditions, which cannot be obtained in an electric arc furnace. For this reason, a laboratory equipment has been designed in order to perform small-scale experiments under well-controlled temperatures and gas atmospheres, with a good reproducibility and interpretability. Old cars are an important source of scrap iron. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are formed during the melting process in an electric arc furnace. The study aims to investigate the mechanisms of VOC formation, specifically focusing on BTEX compounds, which include both ethylbenzene and toluene. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as VOCs produced in similar conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as VOCs in the context of their formation in an electric arc furnace, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance.",
