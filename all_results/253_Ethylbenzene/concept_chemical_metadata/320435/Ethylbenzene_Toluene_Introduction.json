    "context": "Also, the dynamic periods investigated were of relatively short duration and longer perturbations may lead to different system responses. Moreover, it is important to note that the effect of cycling step changes will likely affect microbial culture evolution and future work characterizing the solid\u2013liquid TPPB during long-term operation would be beneficial. From the results of this study, it is also of intent to recognize that many of the VOC treatment devices mentioned here, such as biofilters, may also benefit from the addition of solid polymer beads into the system as a suspended or packing medium, and further work in this area is suggested. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and mixture of xylenes (BTEX) are monoaromatic hydrocarbon compounds. Water contamination by monoaromatic compounds is a very serious problem as these compounds are toxic and often classified as carcinogens for humans (Pohl et al., 2003; An, 2004; Reineke et al., 2006; Paix\u00e3o et al., 2007). Important sources of water contamination by monoaromatics are due to industrial waste, leakage, spills, improper disposal and accidents during transportation in oil industries (oil refinery, petrochemical companies). Storage tanks (that release petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricating oil), gas work sites, airports, paint manufactures, chemical industries (that release pesticides, plastics, synthetic fibers) and railway yards are also sources of contamination (Vidali, 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as monoaromatic hydrocarbon compounds that contribute to water contamination, posing significant health risks due to their toxicity and classification as potential carcinogens. They are mentioned together in the context of environmental pollution, particularly from industrial sources, but no specific interaction or comparative analysis between the two compounds is provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are categorized together as harmful monoaromatic compounds contributing to water contamination. However, their relationship is not explored in detail, indicating a general connection rather than a specific interaction.",
