    "context": "It should be noticed that maximum levels of monoaromatic compounds allowed in the United States for drinking water are 0.005, 1, 0.7 and 10 parts per million (ppm) for benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and mixed xylenes, respectively (United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), 2006). Generally, high vapor pressure and low molecular weight mean that the compound is more likely to volatilize out of water solution (Lee et al., 2004). Henry's law constant helps to predict the behavior of pollutants in remediation procedures such as air stripping processes. As data show, ethylbenzene > xylenes > toluene > benzene can diffuse and volatilize through air stripping from water in this order (Langwaldt and Puhakka, 2000). Also, the decimal logarithm of octanol\u2013water partition coefficients is consistent with the already mentioned fact that monoaromatic pollutants are hydrophilic, soluble in water and that they can be easily removed from water by evaporation and stripping (Zytner, 1994; Lipson and Siegel, 2000; Plyasunov and Shock, 2000; Lee et al., 2004; Lin and Chou, 2006). Other parameters often used to characterize aqueous solutions of these compounds are theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD), which corresponds to the stoichiometric amount of oxygen required to fully oxidize a given molecule, and total organic carbon (TOC), which is the total amount of organic carbon in an aqueous sample. There are several methods that can be used to determine the content of monoaromatic hydrocarbons in a water sample. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as monoaromatic compounds with specified maximum allowable levels in drinking water. The discussion focuses on their properties related to volatilization and removal from water, indicating that both compounds share similar characteristics as pollutants. However, the relationship is primarily based on their classification and regulatory limits rather than any direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are categorized together as monoaromatic compounds with similar environmental behavior, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or significance beyond their regulatory limits.",
