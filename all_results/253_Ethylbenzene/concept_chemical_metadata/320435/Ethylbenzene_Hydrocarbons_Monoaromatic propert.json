    "context": "However, it is widely accepted that adsorption characteristics depend on the composition of the liquid medium, which can give rise to potentially high errors during solute quantitation. As already stated, aromatic compounds can also be detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fitted with an ultraviolet (UV) detector (Yadav and Reddy, 1993; Kelly et al., 1996; Zepeda et al., 2006; Vogt et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2006). These methods can measure constituent concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb) ranges, the lower detection limit being between 1 and 500\u03bcg/L, depending on the method and equipment. It should be emphasized that the present columns that are available for HPLC (see Table 3 ) are not able to separate all forms of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, since ethylbenzene and xylene isomers have usually similar retention times. A summary of the various techniques available for the detection of monoaromatic hydrocarbons in water and typical conditions used is given in Table 3. Water samples are usually collected from water sources with decontaminated containers such as disposable bottles. Sterile disposable gloves and other clean sterilized sampling equipment should be used. Also, standard key points about sampling, preservation, handling and analysis of monoaromatics in contaminated water have been defined such as (Kuran and Sojak, 1996; USEPA standard method, 8260B; USEPA, 1997; Environment Canada, 2005) the following: (1) An amber glass bottle with teflon-lined cap and volume 40mL is recommended as the container.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a monoaromatic hydrocarbon that can be detected using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The text discusses the challenges in separating ethylbenzene from other similar hydrocarbons, such as xylene isomers, due to their similar retention times. This indicates that ethylbenzene is a specific type of hydrocarbon, highlighting its classification within the broader category of hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and hydrocarbons, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a monoaromatic hydrocarbon. The context provides evidence of its detection methods and challenges in analysis, indicating a clear relationship within the field of analytical chemistry.",
