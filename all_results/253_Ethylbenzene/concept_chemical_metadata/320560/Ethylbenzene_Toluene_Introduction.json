    "context": "Results seem to indicate that increasing its organic content up to 50\u201360% by a selection in origin could improve the maximum elimination capacities, although more studies to evaluate the minimum EBRT are needed. In the US, risk assessments of air toxics suggest increased health effects in urban areas (Caldwell et al., 1998; Woodruff et al., 1998). There has been increased attention on community exposure to air toxics and in particular the volatile organics compounds and the composite exposure to air toxics from the range of sources and locations (Woodruff et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 1999; Environment Australia, 2002). Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) are some of the most common air toxics found in urban airsheds (Lee et al., 2002; Bono et al., 2003). BTEX are emitted from a range of sources and monitoring has shown elevated concentrations in Australian cities (Environment Australia, 2002). Sources include combustion products of wood and fuels, industrial paints, adhesives, degreasing agents, and aerosols (Environment Australia, 1999). Traffic, for example is considered an important source of benzene for both indoor and outdoor exposure (Jo and Park, 1999; Crebelli et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2001). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which consists of common air toxics found in urban environments. The discussion highlights their presence in air quality assessments and sources of emissions, indicating that both compounds are significant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to urban air pollution. However, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative health effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX group and are mentioned in relation to urban air quality. Their connection is acknowledged, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or health implications.",
