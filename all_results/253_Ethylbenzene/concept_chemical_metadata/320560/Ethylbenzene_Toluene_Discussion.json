    "context": "When these participants undertaking arts and crafts were removed from the dataset, the factors influencing BTEX exposure were refuelling, motor vehicle related activities and use of an underground car park. Overall participants spent more time indoors than outdoors as reported in other studies and a similar time indoors in Europe and America where an average of 85% of the time compared with an average of 83% (both indoors at home and at work) in our study (Ramirez-Aguilar et al., 2002; Simoni et al., 2003). There was little difference between the cities and no association with BTEX exposure despite a range of heater use in the sampling periods. Use of an air conditioner in summer was associated with increased exposure to toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes. As air conditioner use tends to result in reduced air exchange rates, this associated increased exposure may be a reflection that the source of these chemicals is primarily indoors, rather than ingress from outdoor sources. The finding of increased time spent outdoors (all activities) was found to decrease personal exposure to BTEX supports the importance of indoor sources of exposure, even though specific outdoor activities such as cycling/running/walking were found to increase BTEX personal exposure for the complete dataset. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has been shown to be another important source of BTEX exposure (Miller et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2002; IARC, 2004). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) exposure, particularly in relation to indoor air quality and sources of exposure. The study highlights that air conditioner use is associated with increased exposure to both compounds, suggesting a shared indoor source of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the BTEX group.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX exposure discussion, indicating a shared context in indoor air quality. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not deeply explored, limiting the strength of their connection.",
