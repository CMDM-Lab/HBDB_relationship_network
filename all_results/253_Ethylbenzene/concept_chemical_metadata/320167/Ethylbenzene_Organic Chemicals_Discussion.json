    "context": "Thus, it is not suitable to detect the transcriptomic response of toxicants from any organ tissues because it cannot be applied to human systems. Peripheral blood is one of the recommended human resources as it can be retrieved in a non-aggressive way. Therefore, we challenged this issue to identify a characteristic molecular signature for early detection of environment toxicants using a rat model. In the present study, we applied microarray technology to identify and characterize the molecular signature in peripheral blood and discover discernable characteristic markers induced by volatile organic compounds, such as DCM, TCE, and EB. Our results showed that exposure to VOCs elicited transcriptomic changes, and could detect global gene expression changes in blood at very early time. It appeared that transcriptomic responses in blood were toxicant-specific, and displayed characteristic molecular signature within transcriptomic responses (Fig.\u00a01). This fact implies that although conventional toxicologic analysis did not find any significant changes in biochemical and pathologic examinations, epigenetic regulations, such as trasncriptomic regulation, occurs in circulating leukocytes and reflects chemical stresses to the body.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that elicits specific transcriptomic responses in peripheral blood when exposed to environmental toxicants. The study highlights the role of organic chemicals, including EB, in inducing molecular changes that can serve as early detection markers for chemical exposure, emphasizing the significance of VOCs in toxicological research.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and organic chemicals, as EB is categorized as a VOC and is specifically studied for its toxicological effects. The context provides evidence of EB's role in inducing transcriptomic changes, indicating a clear relationship within the framework of environmental toxicology.",
