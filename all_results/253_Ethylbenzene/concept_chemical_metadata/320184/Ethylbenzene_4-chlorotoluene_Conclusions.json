    "context": "This suggests that a high solid retention time improved the elimination of PAHs, but that this was partly compensated for by the lower biological activity. This is demonstrated by two observations (Table 6 ): (1) the volatile to total solids ratio decreased with increasing retention time in the MBR (from 80 to 52%) and (2) the maximum specific oxygen utilization rate (sOUR; Spanjers et\u00a0al., 1996) decreased from 17 to 8\u00a0mg O2/(g VSS-h). In this study, we reviewed five typical Italian scenarios for the occurrence, treatment, and fate of aromatic organic compounds (23 VOCs and 16 PAHs) in municipal conventional activated-sludge plants and membrane bioreactors. Our results suggest the following main conclusions: \u25a0 Among the aromatic VOCs, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and 4-chlorotoluene were most common. However, toluene showed the highest concentrations, ranging from 3 to 7\u00a0\u03bcg/L; all the others had concentrations less than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L. The removal of aromatic VOCs was comparable in the conventional and membrane systems, despite the strong aeration used for membrane scouring in the submerged MBRs. The biodegradation was not significantly influenced by the high sludge age, probably due to the high water-solubility of these compounds; this differs from the PAHs, which were more efficiently biodegraded.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene are both identified as aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in municipal wastewater treatment scenarios. The study highlights their presence among other VOCs, indicating that they are part of the same category of compounds being analyzed for their occurrence and treatment in activated-sludge plants and membrane bioreactors. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the biodegradation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene, as they are both mentioned as common aromatic VOCs in the same study context. However, their relationship lacks detailed exploration or evidence of interaction.",
