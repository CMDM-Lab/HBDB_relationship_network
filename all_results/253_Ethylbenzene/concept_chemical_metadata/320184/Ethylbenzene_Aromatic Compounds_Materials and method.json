    "context": "The criteria used to select the representative WTPs were based on: (1) the design (maximal) treatment capacity (from 12\u00a0000 to 700\u00a0000 population-equivalent); (2) the types of wastewater collected in the public sewer system; (3) the need for co-treatment of municipal liquid wastes (mainly sewage from septic tanks and municipal landfill leachate); (4) the types of biological processes (i.e., predenitrification\u2013nitrification, extended oxidation, multizone biological nutrient removal, intermittent aeration of continuously fed bioreactors, MBRs). In addition, as we discuss in Section 2.2, we studied MBR technology in WTPs B, C, and D, where pilot-, demonstration-, or full-scale MBRs operated in parallel with full-scale CASPs. We analyzed the aromatic compounds by means of gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS, Agilent technology 5975 inert Mass selective detector, Agilent technology 6890 N network GCs, Agilent technology 7683B series Injector, e O.I. analytical ECLIPSE 4660) according to the U.S. EPA methods (EPA 8270C/96 and EPA 8260B/96). We selected target aromatic compounds from the widely occurring BTEXS (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene) VOC group, the 16 PAHs recommended by the US-EPA, plus an additional 17 aromatic VOCs. To account for variability of the influents, we obtained samples distributed throughout the year (from 2005 to 2008), except in August, when industrial production and municipal inputs were drastically reduced. We obtained at least six daily composite samples of raw wastewater using conventional refrigerated samplers. We paid particular attention to the solid\u2013liquid partitioning, since it is well established that the particulate fraction may include the largest portion of the potential pollution load (Ashley et\u00a0al., 2004).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the target aromatic compounds analyzed within a broader group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) known as BTEXS, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylenes. The study employs gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to assess these aromatic compounds in wastewater treatment processes, highlighting ethylbenzene's classification as an aromatic compound and its relevance in environmental monitoring and pollution assessment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and aromatic compounds, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized within the group of aromatic VOCs being analyzed. The context provides evidence of its inclusion in a targeted study, indicating a clear relationship.",
        "score": 4
