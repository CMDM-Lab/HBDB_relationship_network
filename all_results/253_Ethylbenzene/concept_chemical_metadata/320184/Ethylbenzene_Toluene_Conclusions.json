    "context": "This suggests that a high solid retention time improved the elimination of PAHs, but that this was partly compensated for by the lower biological activity. This is demonstrated by two observations (Table 6 ): (1) the volatile to total solids ratio decreased with increasing retention time in the MBR (from 80 to 52%) and (2) the maximum specific oxygen utilization rate (sOUR; Spanjers et\u00a0al., 1996) decreased from 17 to 8\u00a0mg O2/(g VSS-h). In this study, we reviewed five typical Italian scenarios for the occurrence, treatment, and fate of aromatic organic compounds (23 VOCs and 16 PAHs) in municipal conventional activated-sludge plants and membrane bioreactors. Our results suggest the following main conclusions: \u25a0 Among the aromatic VOCs, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, styrene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and 4-chlorotoluene were most common. However, toluene showed the highest concentrations, ranging from 3 to 7\u00a0\u03bcg/L; all the others had concentrations less than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L. The removal of aromatic VOCs was comparable in the conventional and membrane systems, despite the strong aeration used for membrane scouring in the submerged MBRs. The biodegradation was not significantly influenced by the high sludge age, probably due to the high water-solubility of these compounds; this differs from the PAHs, which were more efficiently biodegraded.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as common aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in municipal wastewater treatment systems. The study highlights that toluene exhibited the highest concentrations among the VOCs analyzed, while ethylbenzene and other compounds had lower concentrations. Both compounds are part of the broader investigation into the treatment and fate of aromatic organic compounds in activated-sludge plants and membrane bioreactors, indicating their relevance in the same environmental context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relationship, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed as part of the same group of aromatic VOCs in wastewater treatment. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not deeply explored beyond their presence in the study.",
