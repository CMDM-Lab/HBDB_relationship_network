    "context": "Some of the urban wastewater (up\u00a0to\u00a06000) is treated in the membrane plant so that it can be reused for irrigation, and the remainder of the inflow (up to 15,000\u00a0m3\u00a0d\u22121) is diverted to the conventional part of the plant. The ultrafiltration membrane has a membrane area of 12,130\u00a0m2; Fatone et\u00a0al. (2007) provide further details. Occurrence and liquid\u2013solid partitioning of aromatic VOCs in influent Except for benzene, the rest of the BTEXS group (toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, styrene) was the most commonly occurring compounds, together with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene (Table 2 ). In particular, toluene was the most relevant compound because of its high level and because it is widely used as an industrial feedstock and a solvent to replace the more toxic and carcinogenic benzene. High BTEXS concentrations were expected since this is a well-known characteristic of diffuse sources such as vehicle emissions (e.g., exhaust, fuel evaporation). On the other hand, the high concentration of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene was not expected, even though other researchers have reported that this compound is sometimes unexpectedly present in air at significant levels (Fernandez-Martinez et\u00a0al., 2000).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEXS group, which are commonly occurring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban wastewater. The text highlights toluene's significance due to its high levels and industrial use, while ethylbenzene is mentioned alongside it, indicating they share a common source and environmental relevance. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are part of the same group of VOCs and are discussed in the context of urban wastewater. Their shared classification indicates some level of interaction or significance, but the lack of detailed discussion on their specific relationship limits the score.",
