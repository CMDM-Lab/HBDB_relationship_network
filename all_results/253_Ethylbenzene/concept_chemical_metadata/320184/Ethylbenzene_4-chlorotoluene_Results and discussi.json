The ultrafiltration membrane has a membrane area of 12,130\u00a0m2; Fatone et\u00a0al. (2007) provide further details. Occurrence and liquid\u2013solid partitioning of aromatic VOCs in influent Except for benzene, the rest of the BTEXS group (toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, styrene) was the most commonly occurring compounds, together with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene (Table 2 ). In particular, toluene was the most relevant compound because of its high level and because it is widely used as an industrial feedstock and a solvent to replace the more toxic and carcinogenic benzene. High BTEXS concentrations were expected since this is a well-known characteristic of diffuse sources such as vehicle emissions (e.g., exhaust, fuel evaporation). On the other hand, the high concentration of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene was not expected, even though other researchers have reported that this compound is sometimes unexpectedly present in air at significant levels (Fernandez-Martinez et\u00a0al., 2000).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene are both mentioned as part of the group of aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in urban wastewater influent. They are listed alongside other compounds like toluene and xylene, indicating their presence in the same environmental sample. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or significance relative to each other within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene are both identified as components of the same group of VOCs in wastewater, but their relationship is not elaborated upon beyond their co-occurrence.",
