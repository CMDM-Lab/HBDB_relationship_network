    "context": "Compared with that study, the present study showed relatively high concentrations of BTEXS in the breathing zones of photocopier workers. For example, the mean benzene and styrene levels in the current study are 138 and 18 times higher, respectively, than in Stefaniak et al. (2000). The difference in BTEXS levels between the two studies might result from the differences in numerous factors such as photocopy center size, photocopier numbers, ventilation systems, toner types, photocopier types, photocopier operation patterns, photocopier maintenance patterns, cleaning solvent selection, binding adhesive usage, outdoor air quality, indoor activities, and other indoor VOC sources. Results from several chamber studies show that toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes are the main compounds emitted from photocopiers (Brown, 1999; Leovic et al., 1996, 1998; Tu, 2003). To identify the BTEXS sources of photocopy centers, the characteristic fingerprints (or profiles) of VOCs from different studies were evaluated in this study. The characteristic fingerprints of VOCs provide a useful method of source identification. Table 7 summarizes the mass ratios of BTEXS in different studies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as significant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from photocopiers, contributing to the overall BTEXS (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylenes) levels in the breathing zones of photocopier workers. The study highlights their presence as part of the VOC emissions profile, indicating a shared relevance in occupational exposure scenarios, but does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of VOC emissions from photocopiers, indicating they are part of the same exposure profile, but lacking detailed discussion on their specific relationship or interactions.",
