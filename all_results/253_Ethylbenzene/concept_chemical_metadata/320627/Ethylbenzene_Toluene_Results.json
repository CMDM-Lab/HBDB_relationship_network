    "context": "In this study, the  H I for all photocopy centers exceeded 1.0, and benzene contributed most to the total risk. If a  H Q exceeds 1.0, then some possibilities exist that noncancer effects may occur, although a  H Q exceeding 1.0 does not indicate a definite effect. The  H Q for benzene in seven photocopy centers ranged from 0.9 to 25.1. The  H Q for toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and styrene in all photocopy centers were below the reference levels. This study concluded that area sampling results could be representative of personal exposure, yet this conclusion only applies to a typical photocopy center in Taiwan. The conclusion does not imply that area sampling can be used to represent personal exposure when space size, operation type, and source of pollutants are different. Due to the climate in Taiwan and the use of air conditioning, the doors of the sampled photocopy centers were generally kept closed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) assessed for their health risk quotients (HQ) in photocopy centers. While the HQ for toluene and ethylbenzene were reported to be below reference levels, indicating lower risk, the study primarily focuses on benzene as the main contributor to total risk. There is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both included in the assessment of VOCs in the same context, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, and they are not shown to interact or influence each other significantly.",
        "score": 2
