    "context": "Exposure to BTEXS in both seasons was based on the average 8-h (full shift) time-weighted average (TWA) concentration, the summation throughout the workday of the product of the concentrations, and the time periods for the concentration encountered in each time interval and was averaged over an 8-h standard workday. The inhaled toxicants were assumed to be totally absorbed for risk calculations in some studies (Hoddinott and Lee, 2000; Muller et al., 2003). However, even though the inhalation studies in humans demonstrate that BTEXS are rapidly and efficiently absorbed via the inhalation route (\u00c5strand et al., 1978; Hjelm et al., 1988; Ramsey and Young, 1978; Ramsey et al., 1980; Ramsey and Andersen, 1984; Scherer et al., 1995; Srbova et al., 1950), the intake of BTEXS via inhalation is not 100% of inhaled dose. In different inhalation studies with human subjects the demonstrated mean retention rates for inhaled benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and styrene ranged from 30% to 80%, 50% to 83%, 49% to 64%, 50% to 73%, and 45% to 93%, respectively (Bardodej and Bardodejova, 1970; Benoit et al., 1985; David et al., 1979; Fustinoni et al., 1998; Gromiec and Piotrowski, 1984; Lof et al., 1993; Nomiyama and Nomiyama, 1974; Ogata et al., 1970; Pekari et al., 1992; Riihimaki and Pfaffli, 1978; Riihimaki and Savolainen, 1980; Srbova et al., 1950; Wallen et al., 1985; Weisel et al., 1996). Guo et al. (2004) assumed the absorption factor of the VOCs for humans was 90% for risk assessment of human exposure to indoor VOCs. Based on the results of previous inhalation studies, the assumption of absorption factor of 90% for inhalation exposure to BTEXS is more reasonable than that of 100%. Therefore, the absorption factor of the BTEXS for humans was assumed to be 90% in this study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the BTEXS group, which also includes benzene, xylenes, and styrene. The discussion focuses on their inhalation exposure and absorption rates in humans, indicating that both compounds are subject to similar absorption dynamics when inhaled. However, the context does not delve into specific interactions or comparative effects between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs and their shared exposure risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEXS group and are discussed in terms of inhalation exposure and absorption rates. However, there is no detailed interaction or specific relationship explored between the two compounds.",
