    "context": "Seal and shake the separatory funnel vigorously for \u223c3 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. DCM creates excessive pressure rapidly, therefore, initial venting should be done immediately after the separatory funnel has been sealed and shaken once. Upon completion of extractions, the extracts of samples A and B were combined, filtered and dried by passing through anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated to approximately 0.5 ml using rotary evaporation and nitrogen blow-down techniques. The concentrated extract was then spiked with internal standards {5-\u03b1-androstane for determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and n-alkane distribution, [2H10]ethylbenzene for BTEX and other alkylbenzene analysis, [2H14]terphenyl (terphenyl-d 14) for PAH analysis, and C30-\u03b2\u03b2-hopane for biomarker analysis}, and then adjusted to 1.00 ml prior to GC analyses.Capillary GC and GC\u2013MS Analyses for alkane distribution and TPHs were performed on an Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector and an HP 7673 autosampler. Analyses of PAHs and biomarker compounds were performed on an HP 5890 GC/HP 5972 mass-selective detector. System control and data acquisition were achieved with an HP G1034C MS ChemStation (DOS series). GC\u2013FID analysis provides a baseline resolution of n-alkanes from n-C8 to n-C41 and n-C17\u2013pristane and n-C18\u2013phytane. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as an internal standard for the analysis of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) compounds, while alkanes are analyzed for their distribution in total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). Both ethylbenzene and alkanes are part of the broader category of hydrocarbons analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) techniques. However, the relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same analytical process rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and alkanes are both analyzed in the same context of hydrocarbon analysis, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their categorization as hydrocarbons.",
        "score": 2
