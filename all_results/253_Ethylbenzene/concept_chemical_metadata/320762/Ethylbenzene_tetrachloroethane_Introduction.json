    "context": "It is also confirmed that a refrigeration temperature below the the freezing point of water is unfavourable, because diffusion out of the extractors is enhanced if residual sample filling the hold-up volume is frozen. Results have shown that capillary extractors are suitable for on-site sampling, or whenever chromatographic analyses of VOCs cannot be carried immediately after SPME sampling. In November 1998, the Oil Research Laboratory of the Emergencies Science and Technology Division (ESTD), Environment Canada was requested by Golder Associ\u00e9 Lt\u00e9e to undertake a case study in which a site and groundwater may be contaminated with gasoline and various chemicals. The general background of the site is as follows: (1) the bedrock aquifer in the area is used by residents for domestic water purposes (individual wells); (2) a petroleum service-station was operated on this site for about 10 years, and this service-station was a source of petroleum products only; (3) the adjacent property was owned by a chemicals handling company, which dealt with all kinds of pure or mixed organic and chlorinated compounds, including trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, chloroform, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The chemicals company allegedly had not handled petroleum products. Both operations were considered to be potentially responsible parties (PRPs). In response to needs of this specific site investigation and spill identification, tiered analytical approaches which facilitated the detailed chemical composition analyses were used to determine individual petroleum hydrocarbons, their relative distribution patterns, and other non-oil related contaminants or source tracing marker compounds in spill samples.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and tetrachloroethane are both mentioned as contaminants associated with a site investigation involving groundwater contamination. They are part of a broader list of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were handled by a chemicals company. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or relationships beyond their presence in the same contaminated environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and tetrachloroethane are listed together among other VOCs in the context of contamination, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
