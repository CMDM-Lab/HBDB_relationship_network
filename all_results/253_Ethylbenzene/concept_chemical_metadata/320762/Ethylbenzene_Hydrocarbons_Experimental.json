    "context": "Seal and shake the separatory funnel vigorously for \u223c3 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. DCM creates excessive pressure rapidly, therefore, initial venting should be done immediately after the separatory funnel has been sealed and shaken once. Upon completion of extractions, the extracts of samples A and B were combined, filtered and dried by passing through anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated to approximately 0.5 ml using rotary evaporation and nitrogen blow-down techniques. The concentrated extract was then spiked with internal standards {5-\u03b1-androstane for determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and n-alkane distribution, [2H10]ethylbenzene for BTEX and other alkylbenzene analysis, [2H14]terphenyl (terphenyl-d 14) for PAH analysis, and C30-\u03b2\u03b2-hopane for biomarker analysis}, and then adjusted to 1.00 ml prior to GC analyses.Capillary GC and GC\u2013MS Analyses for alkane distribution and TPHs were performed on an Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector and an HP 7673 autosampler. Analyses of PAHs and biomarker compounds were performed on an HP 5890 GC/HP 5972 mass-selective detector. System control and data acquisition were achieved with an HP G1034C MS ChemStation (DOS series). GC\u2013FID analysis provides a baseline resolution of n-alkanes from n-C8 to n-C41 and n-C17\u2013pristane and n-C18\u2013phytane. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as an internal standard for the analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and other alkylbenzenes. Hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene, are analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) techniques to determine their distribution and concentration in environmental samples. This indicates that ethylbenzene is a specific type of hydrocarbon being studied, highlighting its relevance in the broader category of hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and hydrocarbons, as ethylbenzene is explicitly used as a standard in the analysis of hydrocarbons. The context provides evidence of its role in the study of TPHs, indicating a clear relationship.",
        "score": 4
