    "context": "It is also confirmed that a refrigeration temperature below the the freezing point of water is unfavourable, because diffusion out of the extractors is enhanced if residual sample filling the hold-up volume is frozen. Results have shown that capillary extractors are suitable for on-site sampling, or whenever chromatographic analyses of VOCs cannot be carried immediately after SPME sampling. In November 1998, the Oil Research Laboratory of the Emergencies Science and Technology Division (ESTD), Environment Canada was requested by Golder Associ\u00e9 Lt\u00e9e to undertake a case study in which a site and groundwater may be contaminated with gasoline and various chemicals. The general background of the site is as follows: (1) the bedrock aquifer in the area is used by residents for domestic water purposes (individual wells); (2) a petroleum service-station was operated on this site for about 10 years, and this service-station was a source of petroleum products only; (3) the adjacent property was owned by a chemicals handling company, which dealt with all kinds of pure or mixed organic and chlorinated compounds, including trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, chloroform, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The chemicals company allegedly had not handled petroleum products. Both operations were considered to be potentially responsible parties (PRPs). In response to needs of this specific site investigation and spill identification, tiered analytical approaches which facilitated the detailed chemical composition analyses were used to determine individual petroleum hydrocarbons, their relative distribution patterns, and other non-oil related contaminants or source tracing marker compounds in spill samples.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the chemicals analyzed in relation to a site potentially contaminated with petroleum products, specifically gasoline. The site investigation aims to identify individual petroleum hydrocarbons and other contaminants. Ethylbenzene, being a component of petroleum, indicates a direct connection to petroleum contamination, although the context does not elaborate on specific interactions or effects between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is a known component of petroleum products. The context discusses its analysis in a site contaminated with gasoline, indicating a clear relevance, though it lacks detailed interaction data.",
        "score": 4
