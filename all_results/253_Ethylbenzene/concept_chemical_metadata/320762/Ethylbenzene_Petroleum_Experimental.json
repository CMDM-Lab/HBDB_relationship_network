    "context": "Seal and shake the separatory funnel vigorously for \u223c3 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. DCM creates excessive pressure rapidly, therefore, initial venting should be done immediately after the separatory funnel has been sealed and shaken once. Upon completion of extractions, the extracts of samples A and B were combined, filtered and dried by passing through anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated to approximately 0.5 ml using rotary evaporation and nitrogen blow-down techniques. The concentrated extract was then spiked with internal standards {5-\u03b1-androstane for determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and n-alkane distribution, [2H10]ethylbenzene for BTEX and other alkylbenzene analysis, [2H14]terphenyl (terphenyl-d 14) for PAH analysis, and C30-\u03b2\u03b2-hopane for biomarker analysis}, and then adjusted to 1.00 ml prior to GC analyses.Capillary GC and GC\u2013MS Analyses for alkane distribution and TPHs were performed on an Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector and an HP 7673 autosampler. Analyses of PAHs and biomarker compounds were performed on an HP 5890 GC/HP 5972 mass-selective detector. System control and data acquisition were achieved with an HP G1034C MS ChemStation (DOS series). GC\u2013FID analysis provides a baseline resolution of n-alkanes from n-C8 to n-C41 and n-C17\u2013pristane and n-C18\u2013phytane. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is analyzed as part of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and is specifically mentioned as an internal standard for BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) analysis. This indicates that ethylbenzene is a component of petroleum products and is relevant in the study of petroleum hydrocarbon distribution and contamination analysis. The relationship is significant as ethylbenzene is a common constituent of petroleum and is used to assess the presence and concentration of petroleum-derived compounds in environmental samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is explicitly used in the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons, indicating its relevance in the context of petroleum studies. The mention of ethylbenzene as an internal standard for BTEX analysis further supports this relationship.",
