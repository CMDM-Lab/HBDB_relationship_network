    "context": "As it can be seen, benzene was decomposed under the gas flow of 0.2\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121 during 15 and 30\u00a0min, under 35 and 15\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). In the case of toluene ozonation under the gas flow of 0.2\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121 and the ozone concentration of 35\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121, this is decomposed in 10\u00a0min. For all cases, ozone has an efficiency of 100% to decompose the toluene (Fig.\u00a03b). Ethylbenzene was not completely decomposed under the tested operating condition (gas flow of 0.5\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121 and ozone concentration of 15\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121). There is a remaining of about 30%. Nevertheless, if the ozone concentration is increased (35\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121) and the gas flow is decreased (0.2\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121), this organics is completely decomposed during 10\u00a0min. This fact is very important considering that among others BTEX, the ethylbenzene is stripped faster (during 10 and 15\u00a0min) (Fig.\u00a03c). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and ozone are related through the process of ozonation, where ozone is used to decompose ethylbenzene. The study indicates that while ethylbenzene is not completely decomposed at lower ozone concentrations, increasing the ozone concentration leads to its complete decomposition within a specified time frame. This highlights the effectiveness of ozone in breaking down ethylbenzene under optimized conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and ozone, as the context provides evidence of ozone's role in decomposing ethylbenzene, supported by quantitative data on decomposition efficiency under varying conditions.",
