    "context": "Finally, it remains to be studied whether preclinic effects or interactions like the one observed in this study may have any role in the high incidence of pancreatic cancer observed in large-scale, retrospective mortality studies in tannery workers in different countries (Veyalkin and Gerein, 2006; Montanaro et al., 1997; Mikoczy et al., 1996; Edling et al., 1986) and also whether CYP2E1 gene may be epigenetically modulated by exposure to toluene or other VOCs, in order to display different enzymatic or other types of behavior. Conflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest. Air emissions coming from a variety of industries contain big amounts of VOC\u2019s and have been subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations over last two decades (Park et\u00a0al., 2008). For example, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX) and methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) are considered as predominant pollutants in areas near to large cities or industrial zones (EPA, 1992). Many VOC\u2019s are emitted to the environment from an extensive variety of sources including combustion products of wood and fuels, industrial production, adhesives preparation, use of degreasing agents and aerosols (Shih and Li, 2008). The presence of VOC\u2019s in atmosphere causes severe health problems (United States Solid waste and EPA 542-R-98-008, 1998). Even when not all VOC\u2019s pose a direct risk to human health, many of them can participate in photochemical smog cycle that is also a source of health danger. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are significant pollutants in industrial emissions and urban areas. They are part of the BTEX group, which is highlighted as a concern for health risks associated with exposure. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparative analysis between ethylbenzene and toluene, focusing instead on their collective impact as pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as they are both categorized as VOCs and pollutants. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions within the context.",
