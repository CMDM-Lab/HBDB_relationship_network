    "context": "HPLC analysis was carried out by a liquid chromatograph Perkin\u2013Elmer series 40 coupled with the UV/VIS detector and a chromatographic column Nova Pack C-18, 250\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.6\u00a0mm. BTEX analysis was performed using a mobile phase of water\u2013acetonitrile (30.0:70.0) with the flow 0.5\u00a0mL\u00a0min\u22121. The injected sample volume was 30\u00a0\u03bcL and the used wavelength for benzene 264\u00a0nm, toluene 250\u00a0nm, ethylbenzene 262\u00a0nm and xylene 249\u00a0nm. Organic acids were determined using the same equipment but using 211\u00a0nm with the same sample volume. The mobile phase was not modified. Therefore, no acidification was needed to obtain the organic acids concentration. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both analyzed as part of a BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene) study using HPLC. They are mentioned in relation to their detection wavelengths during chromatographic analysis, indicating they are part of the same analytical procedure. However, there is no discussion of their chemical interactions or specific relevance beyond their inclusion in the same analytical method.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX analysis and are mentioned together in the context of their detection methods. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
