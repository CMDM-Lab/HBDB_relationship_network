    "context": "Considering the activated carbon renovation after each experiment and the extraction procedure (that was developed just after each experiment was finished), one may claim that gas phase transient dynamics is close to that depicted in Fig.\u00a02. On the other hand, the steady state concentration of each compound is no longer related to the actual gas phase concentration, because the adsorbed contaminant in the activated carbon cannot be eliminated by simple ozonation.Identification of intermediates and final compounds formatted in the BTEX ozonation In order to identify intermediates and final products of the BTEX decomposition in ozonation, the HPLC analysis at specific conditions (see 2.2) was realized. In Table\u00a02 are presented all products obtained in the BTEX ozonation with their concentration in the extract in methanol and in the gaseous phase in the tubular reactor. In the base of data presented in this table we may conclude that all intermediates and final products identified are presented in the gaseous phase as trace (<2.0\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121), except formic acid in the benzene decomposition, oxalic acid in the toluene decomposition, benzoic acid in the ethylbenzene decomposition and malonic acid in the xylene decomposition with concentrations in the range of 3.0\u201315\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121. In the comparison of all experimental conditions, the best results in the efficiency of the degradation of initials VOC\u2019s and intermediaries were obtained under a flow of 0.2\u00a0L\u00a0min\u22121 and ozone concentration of 35\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121. Experimental results show that the ozonation in the gaseous phase is effective for the reduction of BTEX\u2019s emission. The decomposition dynamics and the decomposition degree depended on the ozonation kinetics and the operating conditions that can be attributed to the chemical structure of studied VOC\u2019s. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in a study examining the ozonation process for the degradation of BTEX compounds. The analysis highlights the decomposition of these compounds during ozonation, noting that specific intermediates and final products are formed from their breakdown. While both compounds are part of the BTEX group and are analyzed together, the context does not provide a detailed interaction between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their shared involvement in the ozonation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX compounds undergoing ozonation, indicating a shared significance in the study. However, their specific interactions or comparative analysis are not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
