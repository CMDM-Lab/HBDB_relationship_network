    "context": "The laboratory equipment used allows a reproducible and detailed study of organic compounds emitted during pyrolysis of tyre rubber, temperature and atmosphere being two well-controlled parameters. Such experiments lead to a better understanding of degradation mechanisms, which is not possible in an industrial furnace, as there are too many varying factors (large dispersion of results). The previous discussion on the possible reaction steps and our experimental results, especially these shown in Figs. 4 and 9 show that an efficient oxidation (close to the combustion conditions) is necessary to avoid the emission of aromatic species. Petroleum distribution worker exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), specifically benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o, p, and m-xylenes (BTEX) are prevalent in the oil industry. Evaporative loss of oil and refined petroleum from liquid surfaces, especially from fuel tanks and tanker trucks during fueling operations, and from fuel filling trucks, combines with emissions from tail pipe exhausts to provide several sources of potential human exposure (Avens et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2012). Inhalation of these volatile contaminants can cause symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headaches (Mohammadyan et al., 2016; Sekhar and Subramaniyam, 2014). Exposures to high concentrations of toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene have also been associated with chronic neurotoxicity (Chen et al., 2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) prevalent in the oil industry, specifically associated with petroleum exposure. The discussion highlights the risks of inhalation of VOCs, including ethylbenzene, from various sources related to petroleum, such as evaporative losses and exhaust emissions. This indicates a direct relationship between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is a component of the VOCs emitted during petroleum handling and combustion processes, which can lead to health issues.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as a VOC associated with petroleum exposure, supported by evidence of health risks from inhalation. The context provides a clear link between the two terms in the setting of occupational exposure.",
