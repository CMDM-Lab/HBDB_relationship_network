    "context": "The laboratory equipment used allows a reproducible and detailed study of organic compounds emitted during pyrolysis of tyre rubber, temperature and atmosphere being two well-controlled parameters. Such experiments lead to a better understanding of degradation mechanisms, which is not possible in an industrial furnace, as there are too many varying factors (large dispersion of results). The previous discussion on the possible reaction steps and our experimental results, especially these shown in Figs. 4 and 9 show that an efficient oxidation (close to the combustion conditions) is necessary to avoid the emission of aromatic species. Petroleum distribution worker exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), specifically benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o, p, and m-xylenes (BTEX) are prevalent in the oil industry. Evaporative loss of oil and refined petroleum from liquid surfaces, especially from fuel tanks and tanker trucks during fueling operations, and from fuel filling trucks, combines with emissions from tail pipe exhausts to provide several sources of potential human exposure (Avens et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2012). Inhalation of these volatile contaminants can cause symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headaches (Mohammadyan et al., 2016; Sekhar and Subramaniyam, 2014). Exposures to high concentrations of toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene have also been associated with chronic neurotoxicity (Chen et al., 2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) prevalent in the oil industry, particularly in relation to worker exposure during petroleum distribution. The discussion highlights the health risks associated with inhalation of these VOCs, including neurotoxicity, but does not detail a specific interaction or relationship between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene beyond their shared classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both identified as VOCs in the same context, indicating they share a general category of concern regarding exposure and health effects, but their specific relationship is not elaborated upon.",
