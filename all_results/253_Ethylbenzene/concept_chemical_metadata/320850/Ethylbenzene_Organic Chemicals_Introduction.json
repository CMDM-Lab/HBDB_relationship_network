    "context": "The laboratory equipment used allows a reproducible and detailed study of organic compounds emitted during pyrolysis of tyre rubber, temperature and atmosphere being two well-controlled parameters. Such experiments lead to a better understanding of degradation mechanisms, which is not possible in an industrial furnace, as there are too many varying factors (large dispersion of results). The previous discussion on the possible reaction steps and our experimental results, especially these shown in Figs. 4 and 9 show that an efficient oxidation (close to the combustion conditions) is necessary to avoid the emission of aromatic species. Petroleum distribution worker exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), specifically benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o, p, and m-xylenes (BTEX) are prevalent in the oil industry. Evaporative loss of oil and refined petroleum from liquid surfaces, especially from fuel tanks and tanker trucks during fueling operations, and from fuel filling trucks, combines with emissions from tail pipe exhausts to provide several sources of potential human exposure (Avens et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2012). Inhalation of these volatile contaminants can cause symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headaches (Mohammadyan et al., 2016; Sekhar and Subramaniyam, 2014). Exposures to high concentrations of toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene have also been associated with chronic neurotoxicity (Chen et al., 2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the pyrolysis of tyre rubber and is categorized under organic chemicals. The discussion highlights the significance of controlling emissions of organic chemicals, including ethylbenzene, to mitigate health risks associated with inhalation exposure in industrial settings, particularly in the oil industry. The relationship is established through the classification of ethylbenzene as an organic chemical and its relevance to human health risks from VOC exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and organic chemicals, as ethylbenzene is explicitly mentioned as a VOC and part of the broader category of organic chemicals. The context discusses health implications and the need for emission control, indicating a clear relationship.",
