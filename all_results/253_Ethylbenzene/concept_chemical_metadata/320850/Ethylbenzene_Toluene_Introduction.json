    "context": "Exposures to high concentrations of toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene have also been associated with chronic neurotoxicity (Chen et al., 2002). Benzene is classified as a class 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research (IARC, 2012), and chronic exposure may cause bone marrow damage, aplastic anemia, and leukemia. Lifetime risk of leukemia has been estimated as about six cases per million among humans exposed to benzene concentrations of 1\u03bcg/m3 in air (WHO, 1996). The time-weighted average exposure guidelines by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists\u2019 (ACGIH) for a conventional 8-h workday is 0.5ppm for benzene, 20ppm for toluene, 100ppm for ethylbenzene and 100ppm for xylene (ACGIH, 2011). Reliable and cost-effective approaches to detect the presence of BTEX exposure is an important part of a risk reduction strategy (Sekhar and Subramaniyam, 2014). Personal exposure of workers to air pollutants can be evaluated using biological monitoring techniques. Chemical analysis of environmental pollutants and associated metabolites in urine has been a common biological monitoring approach (Lauwerys and Hoet, 2001; Lin et al., 2008). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with chronic neurotoxicity. They are part of a group of chemicals (BTEX) that pose health risks, particularly in occupational settings. The context discusses exposure guidelines and the importance of monitoring these compounds, indicating a shared relevance in terms of health risks and regulatory standards, but does not detail their specific interactions or comparative effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in relation to health risks from exposure, indicating they are part of the same toxicological context. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
        "score": 3
