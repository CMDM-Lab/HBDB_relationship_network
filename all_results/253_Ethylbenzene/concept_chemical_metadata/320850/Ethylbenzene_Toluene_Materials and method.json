    "context": "Differences between BTEX measurements (air and urine) across types of job (tanker loading workers, tank-gauging workers, drivers, firefighters, office workers) were assessed using one-way ANOVAs with Kruskal-Wallis post-hoc testing. The strength and statistical significance of the association between personal airborne BTEX exposure and urinary markers of BTEX was further evaluated. We evaluated urinary markers of BTEX as the difference in concentration measured post- to pre-shift. The association for each BTEX compound, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, was assessed individually using linear regression models, in which the independent variables were the airborne exposure levels. The normality of the airborne and urinary BTEX concentrations was assessed graphically using quantile-quantile plots and formally using the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Statistical significance of each association was based on two-sided likelihood ratio tests. The linear regression models were adjusted for potential confounders including, age (30\u201340, 41\u201350, 51\u201362 years), urinary cotinine, urinary creatinine and type of job. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and are evaluated for their associations with personal airborne exposure and urinary markers. The study employs statistical methods to assess the relationship between airborne levels of these compounds and their corresponding urinary concentrations, indicating a shared relevance in occupational exposure assessments. However, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed beyond their inclusion in the BTEX group.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are analyzed together in the context of BTEX exposure and urinary markers, indicating a shared significance in the study. However, their direct relationship is not explicitly explored.",
        "score": 3
