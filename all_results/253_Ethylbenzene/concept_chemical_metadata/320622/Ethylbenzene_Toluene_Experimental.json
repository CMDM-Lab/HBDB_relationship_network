    "context": "The experimental parameters as injection port temperature, water sample injecting volume and concentration of analytes in relationship to stripping efficiency of analytes in time as well as linearity of calibration dependences and limits of determination and quantification were investigated. Materials Chromosorb P NAW 60\u201380mesh with a specific surface area of 5m2 g\u22121, packing density of 0.35gml\u22121 and upper temperature limit of 350\u00b0C as packed materials were purchased from Supelco (Bellafonte, PA, USA). The liner (splitless single-taper, 900\u03bcl volume) is full of sorbent up to two-third of its volume. Standards BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p- and o-xylene) were from Slovak Institute of Metrology (Bratislava, Slovakia), and methanol (gradient grade) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Glass syringes for water sampling (volumes 5, 10, 25, 100, and 250\u03bcl) were from Hamilton (Bonaduz AG, Switzerland). Restrictor as an uncoated deactivated silica capillary column of 0.3m\u00d70.1mm from CACO (Bratislava, Slovakia) was used for investigation of the sorption\u2013desorption process of analytes in replete GC liner, and a DB-130m\u00d70.32mm ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers. They are analyzed together in relation to their stripping efficiency and calibration in gas chromatography. However, the context does not provide specific details about their interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as part of the BTEX analysis, indicating a shared category but lacking detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
