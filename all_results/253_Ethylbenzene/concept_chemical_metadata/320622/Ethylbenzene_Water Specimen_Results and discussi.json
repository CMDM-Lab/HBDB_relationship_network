    "context": "For large volume direct aqueous injection method, the LOD values of BTEX are from 0.6 to 1.1\u03bcgl\u22121 and LOQ values are from 2.0 to 3.6\u03bcgl\u22121 (Table 2 ). The progressive trend (from benzene to o-xylene) of this values results from the fact that at 3min stripping time approximately 95% of injected o-xylene mass penetrate to the column from injection port while for benzene it is approximately 98% (Fig. 2). The same results were reached after 200 injections of 250\u03bcl water sample without replacement of sorbent material. Reached LOD and LOQ values are lower by two orders than those reached by methods of direct aqueous injection and flame ionization detection before, and are below the normalized quality limit for drinking water (5, 1000, 700, and 10,000\u03bcgl\u22121 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene, respectively), which makes this method suitable for monitoring of BTEX in water samples at trace levels. This LOD and LOQ values reached by flame ionization detection are comparable with values published by Zwang et al. with MS detection. In that work the injected sample volume is 25 times less and whole sampling volume is getting into the column in contrast with present work, thus the water elution as a solvent peak significantly decreases the sensitivity of MS detection in the elution area of BTEX.Real sample In Fig. 3 is shown the chromatogram of water sample contaminated with gasoline at sampling volume 250\u03bcl. River sample were contaminated with gasoline at concentration 1mgl\u22121 and determinated concentrations were 8, 45, 16, 35 and 25\u03bcg1\u22121 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene, respectively.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is analyzed as part of a study on the detection of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene) in water specimens. The method described demonstrates the capability to monitor trace levels of ethylbenzene in water samples, indicating its relevance in assessing water quality and contamination levels. The study highlights the importance of detecting ethylbenzene in water to ensure it meets safety standards for drinking water.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and water specimens, as the context discusses the detection of ethylbenzene in water samples and its implications for monitoring water quality. The quantitative data on LOD and LOQ values supports this relationship.",
