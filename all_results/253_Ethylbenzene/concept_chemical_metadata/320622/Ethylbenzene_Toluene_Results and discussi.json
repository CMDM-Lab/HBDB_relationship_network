    "context": "Reached LOD and LOQ values are lower by two orders than those reached by methods of direct aqueous injection and flame ionization detection before, and are below the normalized quality limit for drinking water (5, 1000, 700, and 10,000\u03bcgl\u22121 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene, respectively), which makes this method suitable for monitoring of BTEX in water samples at trace levels. This LOD and LOQ values reached by flame ionization detection are comparable with values published by Zwang et al. with MS detection. In that work the injected sample volume is 25 times less and whole sampling volume is getting into the column in contrast with present work, thus the water elution as a solvent peak significantly decreases the sensitivity of MS detection in the elution area of BTEX.Real sample In Fig. 3 is shown the chromatogram of water sample contaminated with gasoline at sampling volume 250\u03bcl. River sample were contaminated with gasoline at concentration 1mgl\u22121 and determinated concentrations were 8, 45, 16, 35 and 25\u03bcg1\u22121 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene, respectively. After injection of pure river water no peak was detected in the elution area of BTEX. A new solventless method employs Chromosorb P NAW in the liner of injection port as asorbent material to retain water in the injection port while the BTEX are stripped into the column. This arrangement enables direct injection of large volume of water sample at using capillary gas chromatography to determine volatile organic compounds BTEX. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX group, which refers to a set of volatile organic compounds commonly found in water samples. The study focuses on the detection and monitoring of these compounds at trace levels in drinking water, indicating their relevance in environmental chemistry. However, the specific relationship or interaction between ethylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as BTEX compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX group mentioned in the context of water monitoring. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
