    "context": "The sample pre-treatment and pre-concentration steps elimination helps to minimize the losses of volatile analytes as well as possibility of sample contamination. The major disadvantage is that water is not compatible with stationary film of capillary columns and with flame ionization detector (FID), as well [5\u20137]. The volatile aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, ortho-, meta-, para-xylene (BTEX) are fuel components commonly found in ground water contamination. The normalized quality limit for drinking water according EPA is for benzene 5, toluene 1000, ethylbenzene 700 and for xylenes 10000\u03bcgl\u22121, respectively. The analysis of BTEX in aqueous samples is usually achieved by purge-and-trap (PTI) gas chromatography (GC). In order to determine water samples with concentration of BTEX on trace levels without any pre-treatment, it is necessary to inject large volumes of 0.1\u20131ml of water sample, needed to be prevented from entering capillary column of gas chromatograph. The upper limit for direct aqueous injection acceptable in capillary GC is 10\u03bcl. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile aromatic compounds that are part of the BTEX group, commonly found in groundwater contamination. They are mentioned together in relation to their regulatory limits for drinking water set by the EPA, indicating their significance in environmental monitoring and analysis. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as contaminants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as part of the BTEX compounds relevant to groundwater contamination, but their relationship lacks detailed interaction or functional significance in the context provided.",
