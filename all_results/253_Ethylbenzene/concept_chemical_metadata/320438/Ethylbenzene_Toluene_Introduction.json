    "context": "In some cities, the exhaust gas from motorcycles is apparently the primary source of mobile pollutants. The exhaust gas is presumed to be harmful to human health as it is known to contain a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) particulate matter and other chemicals. VOCs have been found to cause acute toxic effects (primarily neurological), cancer (such as leukemia), neurobehavioral effects and adverse effects on the kidney. The major volatile components of motorcycle exhaust include benzene (B), toluene (T), ethyl benzene (E) and xylene (X). A portion of the absorbed benzene is excreted in exhaled air unmetabolized; however, a large portion of the absorbed compound is metabolized to benzoic acid. This compound is conjugated with glycine in the liver and eventually excreted in urine as hippuric acid. The acute health effects associated with exposure to benzene include dizziness, muscle weakness, confusion and incoordination. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as major volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in motorcycle exhaust, which is a significant source of mobile pollutants. They are mentioned together as components of the harmful emissions that can lead to acute toxic effects and other health issues. However, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or comparative health impacts beyond their shared presence in exhaust gas.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both categorized as VOCs in motorcycle exhaust, indicating a general connection. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
