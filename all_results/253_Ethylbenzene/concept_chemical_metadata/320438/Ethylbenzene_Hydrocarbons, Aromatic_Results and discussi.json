    "context": "As many chemicals do not become airbone easily, oral LD50 in acute dose\u2013mortality curve was used to estimate the quantity of chemical that would be potentially lethal for a human. According to Taiwan EPA (e.g., http://flora2.epa.gov.tw/toxicweb/ToxicUC4/database/1330207.doc for xylene), oral LD50 (in g/kg) in rats were almost in the same order of magnitude (OM) (e.g., benzene (4.70), ethylbenzene (5.46), toluene (5.00), xylene (5.10\u00b13.5)). According to US EPA (e.g., http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/hlthef/xylenes.html for xylene), air LD50 (in g/m3) in mice almost followed identical OM trends (e.g., benzene (32.0), toluene (33.2), xylene (27.6), ethylbenzene (17.4)). Thus, this suggested that EC50 might be relatively viable for parallel OM trends (except ethylbenzene) and could be used to define the margin of safety for suspected pollutants (see afterwards).Motorcycle exhaust using different reformulated gasolines 3.2.1 Different reformulated oxygen and benzene gasoline Literature [15,37\u201339] indicated that increases in the oxygen and aromatic hydrocarbon (HC) contents lead to marked rises in the concentrations of PAHs in motorcycle exhaust. The concentration of PAHs composition profiles were listed in Fig. 3 . The highest mass concentration of the main composition, naphthalene, is approximately ranged from 45 to 80\u03bcg/Nm3. Furthermore, the highest toxic concentration of the main composition, benzo(a)pyrene, is roughly ranged from 20 to 30\u03bcg/Nm3. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed as a specific aromatic hydrocarbon, with its oral and air LD50 values compared to other similar compounds like benzene, toluene, and xylene. The mention of ethylbenzene within the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons indicates its classification and potential toxicity, but does not delve into specific interactions or unique properties beyond its inclusion in toxicity assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethylbenzene is categorized under aromatic hydrocarbons, sharing general characteristics and toxicity profiles. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or unique relevance beyond this classification.",
