    "context": "This so-called stepwise SPME consists of two separate SPME procedures: (a) a standard is first extracted on a SPME fibre/coating; and (b) the standard-loaded fibre is successively used to extract the target analytes. The objective of this work is to realize the idea of stepwise SPME for analysis of VOCs in ambient air. Obviously, the approach to be developed is not equivalent to the classic internal standard or standard addition calibration, for in the latter standard material is added into the sample prior to sampling. For field application of stepwise SPME, BTEXs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) were selected as the target compounds since they have been well investigated as indicator substances (markers) for human exposure to VOCs and to petroleum-related compounds. It is known that traffic is the main source of BTEXs in ambient air because of the releases of gasoline and diesel from diverse vehicles and gas stations, etc., while both contamination from the outside as well as human activities in homes such as smoking, cooking, heating, etc., contribute to the amount of BTEXs in indoor air. Preparation of standard gases or gas mixtures Several methods have been developed for the preparation of standard gases. Two methods were employed in this work to prepare the required standard gases or gas mixtures as follows (Table 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. These compounds are recognized as indicators of human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and petroleum-related substances. The context highlights their relevance in environmental monitoring, particularly concerning air quality and pollution from traffic and other human activities. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their classification as BTEX compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are part of the same group of VOCs (BTEX) and are discussed in the context of environmental exposure. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed, limiting the strength of their connection.",
