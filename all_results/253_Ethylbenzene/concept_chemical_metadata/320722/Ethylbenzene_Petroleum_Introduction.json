    "context": "This so-called stepwise SPME consists of two separate SPME procedures: (a) a standard is first extracted on a SPME fibre/coating; and (b) the standard-loaded fibre is successively used to extract the target analytes. The objective of this work is to realize the idea of stepwise SPME for analysis of VOCs in ambient air. Obviously, the approach to be developed is not equivalent to the classic internal standard or standard addition calibration, for in the latter standard material is added into the sample prior to sampling. For field application of stepwise SPME, BTEXs (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) were selected as the target compounds since they have been well investigated as indicator substances (markers) for human exposure to VOCs and to petroleum-related compounds. It is known that traffic is the main source of BTEXs in ambient air because of the releases of gasoline and diesel from diverse vehicles and gas stations, etc., while both contamination from the outside as well as human activities in homes such as smoking, cooking, heating, etc., contribute to the amount of BTEXs in indoor air. Preparation of standard gases or gas mixtures Several methods have been developed for the preparation of standard gases. Two methods were employed in this work to prepare the required standard gases or gas mixtures as follows (Table 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) that serve as indicators for human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and petroleum-related substances. The text highlights that BTEXs are primarily released into the environment from traffic sources, particularly gasoline and diesel, linking ethylbenzene directly to petroleum products and their impact on air quality. This establishes a clear relationship between ethylbenzene and petroleum as both are associated with VOC emissions from fuel sources.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and petroleum, as ethylbenzene is categorized as a marker for exposure to petroleum-related compounds, supported by evidence of its presence in emissions from traffic and fuel sources.",
