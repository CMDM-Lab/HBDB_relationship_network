    "context": "Low VOC recovery seems to be due to the physical state of the extracting phase (a coating external to the fiber core), because mass exchanges with atmosphere are very difficult to avoid with the \u201cexternal coating\u201d design.Capillary extraction and storage by capillary extractors Recently the author has studied a different approach to solid-phase microextraction, which uses open tubular traps with embedded press-fits [7\u201310]. These \u201ccapillary extractors\u201d are made by using pieces of common apolar open-tubular capillary columns. In this way the extracting phase is totally shielded from external cross-contamination by the glass (or fused silica) support; VOCs sampled by capillary extractors might be lost by slow diffusion through the thin holes of extractor ends. So, long-term storage of VOCs within capillary extractors capped with press-fit caps seems to have very good potential to solve several problems linked to on-site sampling by standard SPME.The choice of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) Since the BTEX system is especially important from an environmental point of view, BTEX was the VOC system selected to test the after-sampling long-term storage effectiveness of in-tube extractors. Capillary extractor preparation Preparation of capillary extractors consisted of: (i) preparing glass high-resolution (HR) GC columns; (ii) cutting them into 15-cm-long pieces; and (iii) giving rise to press-fits into their ends. Glass was the preferred support material to make in-tube SPME extractors since the author makes his own borosilicate glass HRGC columns. Extractive results are expected to be the same if fused-silica support replaces capillary glass. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) system, which is significant for environmental studies related to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the text primarily focuses on the methodology of sampling and storage of these VOCs rather than detailing any specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene themselves. Their mention is more about their inclusion in a broader category of VOCs rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as they are both part of the BTEX group relevant to environmental studies. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions in the context provided.",
