    "context": "Approximately 90% of the local citizens rely on public transport facilities for their daily commuting (ISD, 2002a). There is a comprehensive public transport network providing convenient access to every corner of Hong Kong. Everyday, more than 11 million passenger journeys are made on the public transportation modes, which include three railway systems, buses, trams, public light buses, taxis and ferries (Transport Department, 2001). The primary interest of this study is to examine the exposure levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and m/p/o-xylene (BTEX) in different popular public commuting microenvironments. These six compounds are strongly associated with vehicular emission and widely monitored in traffic-related microenvironments such as vehicle cabins and roadside sites. A total of nine popular public transportation modes in Hong Kong were monitored in this study. The features of the measured routes are summarized in Table 1 and the location of these routes is also shown in Fig. 1 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are monitored for exposure levels in various public transportation microenvironments in Hong Kong. They are part of a group of compounds (BTEX) associated with vehicular emissions, indicating a shared relevance in studies of air quality and pollution exposure. However, the context does not detail their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the same category of pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as both are mentioned as VOCs related to vehicular emissions. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions within the context.",
        "score": 2
