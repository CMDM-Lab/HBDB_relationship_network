    "context": "Approximately 90% of the local citizens rely on public transport facilities for their daily commuting (ISD, 2002a). There is a comprehensive public transport network providing convenient access to every corner of Hong Kong. Everyday, more than 11 million passenger journeys are made on the public transportation modes, which include three railway systems, buses, trams, public light buses, taxis and ferries (Transport Department, 2001). The primary interest of this study is to examine the exposure levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and m/p/o-xylene (BTEX) in different popular public commuting microenvironments. These six compounds are strongly associated with vehicular emission and widely monitored in traffic-related microenvironments such as vehicle cabins and roadside sites. A total of nine popular public transportation modes in Hong Kong were monitored in this study. The features of the measured routes are summarized in Table 1 and the location of these routes is also shown in Fig. 1 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of the BTEX group, which is monitored for exposure levels in public transport environments due to their association with vehicular emissions. The study focuses on measuring these compounds in various commuting microenvironments in Hong Kong, indicating a shared relevance in assessing air quality and exposure risks related to traffic pollution. However, there is no specific discussion of their individual interactions or comparative significance within the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene, as they are both included in the BTEX group monitored for exposure in public transport. However, their relationship is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their connection.",
