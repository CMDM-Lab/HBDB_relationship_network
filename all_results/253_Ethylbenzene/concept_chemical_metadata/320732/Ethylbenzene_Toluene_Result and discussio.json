    "context": "This objective has recommended an indoor air standard of 16 \u03bcgm\u22123 as a time-independent mean for benzene. In this study, the maximum benzene concentration as recorded in air-conditioned bus was 12.4 \u03bcgm\u22123. Hence, there is no exceedance of the standard in any surveyed journey. For other aromatics, the health-protecting limit given by the HKIAQO is 1.09 mgm\u22123 for ethylbenzene and 1.45 mgm\u22123 for both toluene and xylene. Again, all the measured TEX concentrations are well below the HKIAQO. Although the health impact of in-vehicle air pollution requires subsequent investigation in epidemiological studies, the comparison results indicate that the Hong Kong public transport users are generally exposed to satisfactory levels of aromatic VOCs during their daily commutes.Comparison with oversea studies The average in-vehicle concentrations of BTEX in the current study were compared with several oversea studies (Table 5 ). In general, the in-vehicle levels measured in this study were significantly lower than those in other studies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with specific health-protecting limits set by the Hong Kong Indoor Air Quality Ordinance (HKIAQO). The study indicates that the measured concentrations of both compounds in public transport are below these limits, suggesting a regulatory focus on their potential health impacts. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative health effects beyond their inclusion in the same regulatory framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and toluene, as they are both regulated under the same health standards for indoor air quality. However, their relationship lacks detailed interaction or functional significance in the context provided.",
        "score": 2
