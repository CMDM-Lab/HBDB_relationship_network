    "context": "Bacterial growth and medium The bacterial species used in this study were obtained from a biofilter treating air contaminated with volatile aromatic compounds (Kennes et al., 1996). They were grown in a liquid medium and were adapted to the toxic organic compounds and working conditions before the biodegradation assays. Isolation and taxonomic identification of the strains are described elsewhere (Veiga et al., 1999). Alkylbenzenes (toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene) mixture with over 99% purity were used as a sole carbon source (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The biodegradation assays were performed with 5 ml aqueous medium introduced in 50 ml flasks closed with screw stoppers and viton septa. The microorganisms were grown at pH 5.9\u00b10.1 in a medium containing: KH2PO4 4.5 g/l, K2HPO4 0.50 g/l; NH4Cl 2 g/l and  MgSO 4 \u00b77H 2 O 0.10 g/l. Vitamins and trace minerals (Kennes et al., 1996) were also included. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is utilized as a sole carbon source for bacterial growth in a biofilter system designed to treat air contaminated with volatile aromatic compounds. The study highlights the role of ethylbenzene in providing carbon necessary for microbial metabolism, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene and carbon utilization in biodegradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and carbon, as ethylbenzene serves as a carbon source for bacterial growth, demonstrating its importance in the biodegradation process. The context provides clear evidence of this relationship within the framework of microbial metabolism.",
        "score": 4
