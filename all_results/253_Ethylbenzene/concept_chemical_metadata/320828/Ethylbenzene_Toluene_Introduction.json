    "context": "Heavy metals inhibit microorganisms by blocking essential functional groups or interfering with essential metal ions incorporation of biological molecules (Doelman et al., 1994; Gadd and Griffiths, 1978; Li and Tan, 1994a,b; Wood and Wang, 1983). In some cases microorganisms are resistant to some heavy metals through different possible mechanisms (Rohit and Sheela, 1994; Tomioka et al., 1994). Studies have been published on the effect of heavy metals on bacterial growth (Benka-Coker and Ekundayo, 1998; Cabrero et al., 1998; Hassen et al., 1998a,b) but little has been reported on their effect on VOC biodegradation or on modeling such effects through simple classical kinetic equations. The goal of this study was to evaluate and model the effect of different concentrations of heavy metals, cadmium, nickel and zinc on the biodegradation of toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene by a Bacillus strain. Experiments were also undertaken with a Pseudomonas sp. in order to confirm, with a bacterial strain distinctly different from Bacillus sp., the good fit between the selected kinetic equation and the experimental data. Bacterial growth and medium The bacterial species used in this study were obtained from a biofilter treating air contaminated with volatile aromatic compounds (Kennes et al., 1996). They were grown in a liquid medium and were adapted to the toxic organic compounds and working conditions before the biodegradation assays. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being evaluated for their biodegradation by specific bacterial strains, particularly Bacillus and Pseudomonas. The study aims to model the effects of heavy metals on the biodegradation process of these compounds, indicating a direct relationship in terms of their environmental impact and microbial degradation potential. However, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed beyond their inclusion in the same biodegradation study.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are part of the same study focusing on their biodegradation by bacteria in the presence of heavy metals. While they are related through the context of biodegradation, their specific interactions are not elaborated.",
