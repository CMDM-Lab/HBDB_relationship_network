    "context": "Heavy metals inhibit microorganisms by blocking essential functional groups or interfering with essential metal ions incorporation of biological molecules (Doelman et al., 1994; Gadd and Griffiths, 1978; Li and Tan, 1994a,b; Wood and Wang, 1983). In some cases microorganisms are resistant to some heavy metals through different possible mechanisms (Rohit and Sheela, 1994; Tomioka et al., 1994). Studies have been published on the effect of heavy metals on bacterial growth (Benka-Coker and Ekundayo, 1998; Cabrero et al., 1998; Hassen et al., 1998a,b) but little has been reported on their effect on VOC biodegradation or on modeling such effects through simple classical kinetic equations. The goal of this study was to evaluate and model the effect of different concentrations of heavy metals, cadmium, nickel and zinc on the biodegradation of toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene by a Bacillus strain. Experiments were also undertaken with a Pseudomonas sp. in order to confirm, with a bacterial strain distinctly different from Bacillus sp., the good fit between the selected kinetic equation and the experimental data. Bacterial growth and medium The bacterial species used in this study were obtained from a biofilter treating air contaminated with volatile aromatic compounds (Kennes et al., 1996). They were grown in a liquid medium and were adapted to the toxic organic compounds and working conditions before the biodegradation assays. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose biodegradation is being studied in relation to the presence of heavy metals like cadmium, nickel, and zinc. The research aims to evaluate how these heavy metals affect the microbial degradation of ethylbenzene by specific bacterial strains. While the study focuses on the interaction between heavy metals and VOC biodegradation, it does not provide detailed insights into the specific mechanisms or effects of heavy metals on ethylbenzene degradation.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is part of the study examining the impact of heavy metals on its biodegradation. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of the interactions between ethylbenzene and heavy metals beyond their co-occurrence in the study.",
