    "context": "Some assays without biomass (blanks) were incubated as well. Controls and blanks were used to check if any abiotic removal of the pollutants took place and to check for heavy metal precipitation in the absence of biomass.Analytical methods Alkylbenzenes were analyzed using a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (Madrid, Spain) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Separation was achieved using a high resolution capillary TR-Wax column under isothermal conditions (Veiga et al., 1999). Concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene were calculated by comparing the areas of standards to the areas and retention times of samples taken during the experiments. The alkylbenzene concentrations in the liquid phase were calculated according to Henry's law correlating equilibrium concentrations between the gas and the liquid phase. Since heavy metals could partly precipitate in the aqueous medium used in the assays, their initial concentration was checked by atomic absorption spectrophotometry on a Varian SpectrAA 300/400 (Madrid, Spain). Effect of heavy metals on alkylbenzene biodegradation Preliminary assays were performed to evaluate the most suitable heavy metal concentration range to be used for each metal in this work (data not shown).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both analyzed as alkylbenzenes using gas chromatography to assess their concentrations in liquid samples. The study focuses on the analytical methods for measuring these compounds, indicating they are part of the same category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being evaluated for their behavior in the presence of heavy metals. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their co-analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of analytical methods for measuring alkylbenzenes, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them.",
        "score": 2
