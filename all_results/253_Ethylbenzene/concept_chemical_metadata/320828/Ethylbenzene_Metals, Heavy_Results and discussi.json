    "context": "Different kinetic equations were tested with data obtained during the studies with Bacillus sp. and with Pseudomonas sp. in order to quantify the effect of each heavy metal on biodegradation of alkylbenzenes. Although the heavy metals are not the growth substrates, the effect on substrate (toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene) removal kinetics with increasing heavy metals concentrations could be modeled mathematically using the Andrews model (Andrews, 1968). This model is usually used for quantifying microbial growth rates with inhibition but was considered to be an appropriate model since alkylbenzene removal rates appeared to be directly linked to microbial growth response for both strains used in this study (Fig. 3 ), although reports describing this application of the kinetic equation on media containing heavy metals are minimal. The heavy metals inhibition constants (K i) for VOC removal were calculated according to the equation: r=r max S K s +S+(S2/K i ) , where r max is the maximum toluene, ethylbenzene or o-xylene degradation rate, S is the heavy metal concentration and K s represents a substrate concentration called the Monod constant. However, since in the heavy metal concentration range tested only inhibitory effects were observed, the equation was simplified by considering that K s was negligible (S\u226bK): 1 r = 1 r max + S K i r max . In such cases, a plot of (degradation rate)\u22121 versus heavy metal concentrations should yield a straight line. The experimental data obtained with Bacillus conformed with Andrews kinetics when plotting the reciprocal of degradation rate versus heavy metal concentrations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is studied alongside heavy metals to evaluate their combined effects on the biodegradation kinetics of alkylbenzenes by microbial strains Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. The presence of heavy metals is shown to inhibit the removal rates of ethylbenzene and other alkylbenzenes, indicating a significant interaction where heavy metal concentrations negatively impact microbial degradation processes. The study employs mathematical modeling to quantify these effects, highlighting the relevance of heavy metals in the biodegradation of ethylbenzene.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and heavy metals, as the context discusses how heavy metals inhibit the biodegradation of ethylbenzene, supported by mathematical modeling of the interaction. This indicates a clear relationship within the study's focus on microbial degradation.",
