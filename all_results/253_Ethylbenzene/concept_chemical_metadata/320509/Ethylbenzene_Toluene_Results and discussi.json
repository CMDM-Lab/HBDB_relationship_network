    "context": "This was due to the fact that more carbon sources, moisture contents and nutrients were present in the bottom section of biofilter, which caused a higher metabolic reaction and thus led to faster biodegradable rate. The moisture content of compost biofilter was varied in the range of 45\u201370% though the moisture content in the biofilter throughout the study was maintained at around 60%. The optimum temperature range of compost based biofilter is varied in the range of 40\u201360%. Nearly 65% of toluene and benzene were removed in the first 25cm of bed depth from lower section, while ethyl benzene and o-xylene were removed around only 52%. Fig. 6 shows that the removal of ethyl benzene and o-xylene penetrated more slowly into the entire column depth. All four BTEX compounds were removed by 90% up to the second section of biofilter while rest of the 10% was removed in the upper part. The BTEX removal profiles along the height of the biofilter were similar to those previously reported for BTEX and paint VOCs degrading biofilters.Microscopic observations The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) can provide information about the microbial community on the biofilter media.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) being treated in a compost-based biofilter. The study highlights that toluene and benzene were removed more efficiently than ethylbenzene and o-xylene, indicating a difference in their biodegradation rates within the biofilter system. This suggests that while both compounds are related as VOCs, their removal dynamics in the biofilter differ significantly.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in the context of their removal from a biofilter, indicating a shared significance in the study of VOC degradation. However, the specific interactions or comparative analysis between the two compounds are not deeply explored.",
