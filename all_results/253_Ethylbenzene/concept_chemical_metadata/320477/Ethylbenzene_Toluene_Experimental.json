    "context": "All of these samplings were basically made with the aid of a box-shaped, vacuum-driven lung sampling system at a mean sampling flow rate slightly exceeding 2Lmin\u22121 (total sampling time of less than 5min). In addition, Tedlar bags containing ultrapure N2 were brought back and forth between field and lab and used to measure blank levels of VOC analysis. For the comparative purposes, on certain occasions, the collection of VOC samples was also made side-by-side by adsorption tubes filled with a Tenax adsorbent. The results of this comparative analysis between the two sampling methods indicated that there was fairly excellent agreement (e.g., 95%) from a number of VOCs (including toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene). However, some differences (up to 30%) were seen from light VOCs like benzene (loss due to insufficient affinity of the sorbent) or from a few heavy VOCs (e.g., above C8 compounds: due to bag wall adsorption loss). As a number of artifacts can be involved in the sampling or analysis of VOC, all VOC data for this study were basically derived by sampling and calibration against the bag sampling method. To facilitate the comparison of our measurement data, we assumed that the loss of certain VOC due to the bag sampling method was comparable between the standard and field samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their presence in air samples using different sampling methods. The study highlights a comparative analysis showing excellent agreement (95%) in the results for these VOCs when sampled side-by-side. However, it does not delve into their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their co-analysis as part of VOC measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of VOC sampling methods, indicating they are part of the same analysis but lacking a detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
