    "context": "It is nonetheless found that the landfilling rates of those two types of wastes differ greatly, as their proportion of burial corresponds to 12% and 40%, respectively. As in other countries, many stringent regulations have hence been introduced in Korea to reduce problems arising from waste treatment. In recognition of the strong potential for pollution from LF facilities and/or their operation, we conducted a field campaign to measure ambient VOC concentration levels from both in and around a municipal landfill site in the city of Dae Gu, Korea during the winter of 2004. For the purpose of this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of 10 individual VOC including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (commonly called BTEX) from a total of eight different points in and around the landfill site. In addition to VOC, some other trace pollutants of environmental importance (e.g., CH4, reduced sulfur compounds (RSC) and gaseous elemental mercury (GEM)) were also investigated concurrently. The results of RSC analysis have been reported in recent publications, while those of other target compounds including Hg will be reported elsewhere. The results of this field-based experimental campaign are thus used to explain the fundamental factors at work in the VOC distributions in the area under the influence of landfill processes and to explore their possible roles in governing the regional and/or local air quality.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured during a field campaign around a municipal landfill site. They are part of a group of compounds (BTEX) analyzed to understand their spatio-temporal patterns and potential impact on air quality. However, the context does not provide specific details on their interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the same study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together as part of a broader analysis of VOCs in the landfill environment, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
