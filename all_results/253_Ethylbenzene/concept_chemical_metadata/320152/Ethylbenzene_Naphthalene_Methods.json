    "context": "Site evaluation This study evaluated a total of 10 commercial and 26 single family and multi-family residential properties that were potentially affected by SVI associated with the three former MGPs in the northeastern United States. Each of the former MGP sites overlaid permeable glacial outwash sands. All of these properties had potable water from municipal water sources. Soil vapor intrusion was evaluated for properties overlying and immediately abutting MGP tar source material and properties overlying and adjacent to dissolved phase benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), and naphthalene plumes emanating from the MGP sites. The influence of depth to groundwater on the potential for SVI was evaluated by categorizing each site according vadose zone (region of aeration above the water table): no vadose zone; water table within 6feet of the building slab (0\u20136feet Vadose Zone); and water table between 6 and 25 feet of the building slab (6\u201325feet Vadose Zone). All commercial and residential properties were located within a range of 0\u20132500feet of the plume or source material at each site. Buildings were evaluated for factors that could influence indoor air quality including the use or storage of petroleum-based household chemical products or those containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs); the use of home heating oil storage tanks, underground storage tanks (USTs) or kerosene heaters; and recent renovations to the building such as new paint or new carpet.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and naphthalene are both mentioned as components of soil vapor intrusion (SVI) associated with former manufactured gas plants (MGPs). They are part of a group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) evaluated for their potential impact on indoor air quality in residential and commercial properties. However, the context does not provide specific details on their interactions or comparative significance beyond their presence in the same environmental assessment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and naphthalene are both identified as VOCs in the same environmental study, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions.",
        "score": 2
