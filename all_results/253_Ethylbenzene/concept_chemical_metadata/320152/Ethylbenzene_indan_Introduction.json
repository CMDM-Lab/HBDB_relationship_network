    "context": "These contaminated sites have been targeted by both federal and state environmental agencies for assessment and remediation. Previous assessments of these sites concentrated on the condition of the soil and groundwater at and surrounding these sites, however recent attention has focused on the potential hazards associated with soil vapor. During the coal gasification process, a dense, oily liquid by-product, coal tar, is generated. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers (BTEX), benzothiophene, carbon disulfide, n-decane, n-dodecane, 2-ethylthiophene, indan, indene, 2-methylthiophene, 3-methylthiophene, nonane, styrene, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, thiophene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, n-undecane, and semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) such as acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, 2-methyl naphthalene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenols, and pyrene. Routine leaks and spills occurred that contaminated surface soils, subsurface soils, and groundwater. These compounds can be present within sub-surface soils or as a dissolved phase groundwater plume. In some cases, these chemical components may be present in nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPL) such as fuels, oils, or tar (Turczynowicz and Robinson, 2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and indan are both mentioned as components of coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), including ethylbenzene and indan, which are relevant in environmental assessments of contaminated sites. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between these two compounds beyond their shared presence in coal tar.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and indan are both identified as VOCs found in coal tar, indicating a general connection. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific significance in the context provided.",
