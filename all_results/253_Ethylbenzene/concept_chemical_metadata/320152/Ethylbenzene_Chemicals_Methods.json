    "context": "This verified the integrity of the soil vapor probe seal at the time of sampling and that the soil vapor samples were representative of subsurface conditions. Collected samples were analyzed by Alpha Woods Hole in Westborough, Massachusetts, a New York State Department of Health approved laboratory, for identification and quantification of sample constituents by high resolution gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectroscopy. Each sample was analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (including naphthalene) by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Method TO-15 and helium by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method 1946.Risk assessment Comparative risk assessments were conducted on the five most frequently detected chemicals in the indoor air of the sampled buildings using the guidelines outlined in EPA\u2019s Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund (USEPA, 1989). The chemicals of concern included benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene. For benzene, a known human carcinogen (NTP, 2005), cancer risk calculations were computed for the mean and maximum concentrations of benzene detected in the sample groups. The inhalation unit risk (IUR) for benzene is 2.2\u00d710\u22126\u20137.8\u00d710\u22126 (USEPA, 2003). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in soil vapor samples, alongside other chemicals like benzene and toluene. The study emphasizes the importance of these chemicals in risk assessments related to indoor air quality, particularly focusing on their detection and potential health risks. Ethylbenzene is included in a list of chemicals of concern, indicating its relevance in environmental health assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is part of a group of chemicals analyzed for risk assessment. While it is mentioned alongside other VOCs, the context does not delve deeply into its specific interactions or unique significance beyond its classification as a chemical of concern.",
