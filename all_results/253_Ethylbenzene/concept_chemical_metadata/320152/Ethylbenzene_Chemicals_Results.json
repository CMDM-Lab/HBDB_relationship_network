    "context": "Background data was derived from United States Environmental Protection Agency Building Assessment and Survey Evaluation (BASE 1994\u20131998) and the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) Guidance for Evaluating Soil Vapor Intrusion in the State of New York (2006). The 95th percentile was substituted for maximum levels in background data to prevent outliers from overestimating background risk. Soil vapor concentrations were compared to indoor air background levels to evaluate intrusion into the indoor air of a building structure. Exposure assessment The most frequently detected chemicals among the sampled sites were benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene. Soil vapor samples were not collected at seven of the locations due to groundwater in contact with the building slab. Of the 36 structures where benzene was detected in the indoor air twenty-two were residential properties and fourteen were commercial properties. The locations, maximum benzene concentrations, and property classification (residential or commercial) summarized in Table 1 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the frequently detected chemicals in soil vapor samples, alongside other volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene. The discussion focuses on the assessment of indoor air quality and potential chemical intrusion from soil vapor, indicating that ethylbenzene is part of a broader category of chemicals evaluated for environmental health risks. However, there is no detailed exploration of ethylbenzene's specific properties or interactions with other chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is included in a list of chemicals detected in environmental assessments. While it is part of a group of chemicals being monitored, the context does not provide a detailed relationship or interaction between ethylbenzene and the broader category of chemicals.",
