    "context": "The IUR is based on a 70kg adult breathing 20m3 of air per day. Cancer risks from inhalation of benzene were calculated by multiplying the mean and maximum concentrations of benzene (Figs. 2\u20134). For the non-carcinogenic assessment of health risk, Hazard Quotients (HQs) and Hazard Indices (HI) were calculated from mean and maximum measured concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene. HQs are calculated by dividing the measured contaminant concentrations by a reference concentration (RfC) derived from the USEPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). The HI approach presumes that simultaneous sub-threshold exposures to several chemicals could result in an adverse health effect; HIs are calculated as sums of a non-cancer hazard quotient. For the purposes of screening, there may be a concern for potential non-carcinogenic effects if the HI is greater than 1 (USEPA, 1989). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) assessed for their health risks through inhalation exposure. The study calculates Hazard Quotients (HQs) and Hazard Indices (HIs) for these compounds, indicating their potential non-carcinogenic effects when exposed simultaneously. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated beyond their inclusion in the same risk assessment framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of a health risk assessment involving VOCs, but their direct interaction or specific relationship is not detailed in the context.",
        "score": 2
