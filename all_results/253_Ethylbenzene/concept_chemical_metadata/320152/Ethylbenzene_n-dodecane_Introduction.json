    "context": "These contaminated sites have been targeted by both federal and state environmental agencies for assessment and remediation. Previous assessments of these sites concentrated on the condition of the soil and groundwater at and surrounding these sites, however recent attention has focused on the potential hazards associated with soil vapor. During the coal gasification process, a dense, oily liquid by-product, coal tar, is generated. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers (BTEX), benzothiophene, carbon disulfide, n-decane, n-dodecane, 2-ethylthiophene, indan, indene, 2-methylthiophene, 3-methylthiophene, nonane, styrene, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, thiophene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, n-undecane, and semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) such as acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, 2-methyl naphthalene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenols, and pyrene. Routine leaks and spills occurred that contaminated surface soils, subsurface soils, and groundwater. These compounds can be present within sub-surface soils or as a dissolved phase groundwater plume. In some cases, these chemical components may be present in nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPL) such as fuels, oils, or tar (Turczynowicz and Robinson, 2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and n-dodecane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. They are part of a broader discussion on the environmental hazards associated with contaminated sites, particularly concerning soil vapor and groundwater contamination. However, there is no specific interaction or functional relationship detailed between ethylbenzene and n-dodecane beyond their classification as VOCs present in coal tar.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethylbenzene and n-dodecane are both identified as VOCs in the same context but lack a direct interaction or significant relationship beyond their shared presence in coal tar.",
        "score": 2
