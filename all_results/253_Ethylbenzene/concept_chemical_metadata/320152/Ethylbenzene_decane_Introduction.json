    "context": "These contaminated sites have been targeted by both federal and state environmental agencies for assessment and remediation. Previous assessments of these sites concentrated on the condition of the soil and groundwater at and surrounding these sites, however recent attention has focused on the potential hazards associated with soil vapor. During the coal gasification process, a dense, oily liquid by-product, coal tar, is generated. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers (BTEX), benzothiophene, carbon disulfide, n-decane, n-dodecane, 2-ethylthiophene, indan, indene, 2-methylthiophene, 3-methylthiophene, nonane, styrene, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, thiophene, 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, n-undecane, and semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) such as acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzo(g,h,i)perylene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, fluoranthene, fluorene, indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, 2-methyl naphthalene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenols, and pyrene. Routine leaks and spills occurred that contaminated surface soils, subsurface soils, and groundwater. These compounds can be present within sub-surface soils or as a dissolved phase groundwater plume. In some cases, these chemical components may be present in nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPL) such as fuels, oils, or tar (Turczynowicz and Robinson, 2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and decane are both mentioned as components of coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. They are categorized as volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) found in contaminated sites targeted for environmental assessment and remediation. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships beyond their presence in coal tar.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and decane are both identified as VOCs in coal tar, indicating a shared category but lacking detailed interaction or significance in the context.",
