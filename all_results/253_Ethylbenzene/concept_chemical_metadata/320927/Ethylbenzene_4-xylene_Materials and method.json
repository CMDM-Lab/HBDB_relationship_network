    "context": "The compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at different concentrations before use. Two mixtures of BTEX compounds were made for this study, namely BTEX-1 and BTEX-2 respectively. BTEX-1 was made by mixing the individual compounds in equal molar, and employed for all experiments. To confirm the prediction model for the combined effects of BTEX, we made another mixture, BTEX-2, by mixing the individual BTEX compounds in a ratio commonly found in the petrol, i.e., 11:26:11:31:12:9 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene and the respective toxic responses of the two mixtures were studied.Cell culture and treatment E. gracilis strain Z and SMZ (generously provided by professor Tetsuya Suzuki, Japan) were cultured in Koren-Hunter (KH) medium with pH 3.5. Cells were maintained in 15mL test tubes under the fluorescent light illumination (2800lux) at 28\u00b0C without aeration with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for Z and 24h in the dark for SMZ strain. For chemical exposure, 1mL of cell (1\u00d7105 mL\u20131, turbidity: 0.065/100\u03bcL) was transferred to 2mL glass vial (29116-U, Sigma\u2013Aldrich Pty Ltd., Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) followed by the addition of 2\u03bcL the toxicants. Medium containing solvent vehicle DMSO (0.2%, i.e. 2\u03bcL in 1mL) only was used as the negative control. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both components of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) mixture used in experiments to study toxic responses. They are mixed in specific ratios to reflect their common presence in petrol, indicating their relevance in assessing combined toxic effects. However, the context does not detail any specific interactions or comparative analysis between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their inclusion in the BTEX mixtures.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are part of the same BTEX mixtures used for toxicity studies, indicating a shared significance in the context of environmental toxicology, but lacking detailed interaction or functional relationship.",
        "score": 3
