    "context": "Although limited number of study subjects were tested, current observations warrant further study to validate this alternative testing strategy. Also, further work on these miRNA signatures is required to provide mechanistic insight into the toxicological effects on circulation. Conflict of interest statement There is no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript. BTEX, a group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), composed of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, are constituents of petroleum and solvents widely used in manufacturing rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, and drugs. These compounds are commonly found as air contaminants in related industrial sites, but vehicle traffic and industrial processes can lead to the contamination of BTEX in the soil and groundwater. In general aquatic environment, the background concentrations of BTEX is relative low because of volatilization and degradation processes. However, accident oil spill, leakage from underground gasoline storage tanks, and improper discharges from petrol and chemical industries can result in BTEX contamination in the soil and ground water.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that belong to the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylenes. These compounds are categorized as organic chemicals due to their carbon-based structure and are commonly found in various industrial applications. The discussion highlights the environmental impact of these organic chemicals, particularly in relation to contamination in soil and groundwater from industrial activities and accidents.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and organic chemicals, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a VOC and part of the BTEX group, which is a well-defined class of organic chemicals. The context provides a clear relationship regarding their industrial relevance and environmental implications.",
        "score": 4
