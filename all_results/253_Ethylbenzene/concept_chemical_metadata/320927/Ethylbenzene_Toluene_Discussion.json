    "context": "Individual compounds were mixed in equal molar in BTEX-1 mixture of which the predicted effects were in good agreement with its observed effects by falling in the 95% confidence levels of the best fit of the regression model (Fig. 6A). The concentration addictive effects of mixed BTEX were further confirmed with BTEX-2in which the single BTEX was mixed in the composition as in the petrol (Fig. 6B). BTEX-2 showed slightly higher toxicity (EC50: 185\u03bcM) than that of BTEX-1 (EC50: 232\u03bcM), but there is no significant difference between after statistical analysis with one-way ANOVA (data not shown). As shown in Supplementary Table 1, BTEX-2 has higher proportion of toluene and m-xylene but less proportion of p-xylene, ethylbenzene and benzene than BTEX-1, which may attribute to the similar effects of these mixtures. Anyway, the agreement of observed and predictive effects of BTEX-2 further confirmed the CA model of combined effects for BTEX mixtures. In mammalian cells, the combined effects are more complicated than concentration addition since BTEX compounds exert their effects through the metabolism by cytochrome p450 (CYP2E1). However, the biotransformation of BTEX in E. gracilis is different or in low efficiency because the E. gracilis cells has different isozymes of microsomal cytochromes P-450 and the identified CYP2E in this organism was not inducible by ethanol.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are components of BTEX mixtures, which are analyzed for their combined toxic effects in mammalian cells. The study indicates that the effects of these compounds are influenced by their concentrations and metabolic interactions via cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1. While both compounds are part of the same mixture and contribute to toxicity, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not deeply explored beyond their inclusion in the BTEX mixtures.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both part of the BTEX mixtures studied for their combined effects. Their relationship is acknowledged through their shared metabolic pathway, but the context does not provide detailed insights into their specific interactions.",
