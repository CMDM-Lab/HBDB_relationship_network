    "context": "One mixture was mixed BTEX in equal molar and the other is mixed in a ratio found in the petrol (gasoline). We then examined all these BTEX compounds for their potential effects on the E. gracilis by examining the morphological changes, chlorophyll content for Z, and compared Z and SMZ in terms of cell growth inhibition and morphological changes. To evaluate the combined effects of BTEX on chlorophyll content we calculated the predictive effects and compared them with the actual observed effects. Chemicals Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene with high purity [\u226599.5% (GC)] were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich Pty Ltd. (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). The compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at different concentrations before use. Two mixtures of BTEX compounds were made for this study, namely BTEX-1 and BTEX-2 respectively. BTEX-1 was made by mixing the individual compounds in equal molar, and employed for all experiments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is one of the specific chemicals included in a mixture of BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene) used for experimental evaluation of their effects on E. gracilis. The mention of ethylbenzene as part of a group of chemicals indicates its relevance in the study, but does not elaborate on its individual properties or interactions beyond being a component of the BTEX mixture.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is included in a list of chemicals without detailed discussion of its specific role or interactions within the context of the study. Its relationship is primarily as a member of a chemical group rather than a significant individual contributor.",
