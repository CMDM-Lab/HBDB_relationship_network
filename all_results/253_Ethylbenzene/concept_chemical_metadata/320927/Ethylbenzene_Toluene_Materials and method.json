    "context": "The compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at different concentrations before use. Two mixtures of BTEX compounds were made for this study, namely BTEX-1 and BTEX-2 respectively. BTEX-1 was made by mixing the individual compounds in equal molar, and employed for all experiments. To confirm the prediction model for the combined effects of BTEX, we made another mixture, BTEX-2, by mixing the individual BTEX compounds in a ratio commonly found in the petrol, i.e., 11:26:11:31:12:9 for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene and the respective toxic responses of the two mixtures were studied.Cell culture and treatment E. gracilis strain Z and SMZ (generously provided by professor Tetsuya Suzuki, Japan) were cultured in Koren-Hunter (KH) medium with pH 3.5. Cells were maintained in 15mL test tubes under the fluorescent light illumination (2800lux) at 28\u00b0C without aeration with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for Z and 24h in the dark for SMZ strain. For chemical exposure, 1mL of cell (1\u00d7105 mL\u20131, turbidity: 0.065/100\u03bcL) was transferred to 2mL glass vial (29116-U, Sigma\u2013Aldrich Pty Ltd., Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) followed by the addition of 2\u03bcL the toxicants. Medium containing solvent vehicle DMSO (0.2%, i.e. 2\u03bcL in 1mL) only was used as the negative control. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of BTEX mixtures, which are commonly found in petrol. The study involves creating two mixtures, BTEX-1 and BTEX-2, to investigate the toxic responses of these compounds along with others. While both are included in the mixtures, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or comparative effects, focusing instead on their collective toxicological assessment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of BTEX mixtures, indicating they share a common category as volatile organic compounds. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed.",
        "score": 2
