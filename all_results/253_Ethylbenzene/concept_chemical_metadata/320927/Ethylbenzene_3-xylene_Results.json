    "context": "The cells with abnormal shape were also found in treated E. gracilis SMZ but much less so in Z with no significance between the treatment and control group (data not shown). The examination and counting of the cells containing lipofuscin suggested that there were one or two of such granules in the cells at lower concentrations of treatment and increased in both numbers and more cells at higher concentrations with deeper brown color appearance (Fig. 3-2).Chlorophyll content decreased by individual and mixed BTEX As presented in Fig. 4 , chlorophyll a of E. gracilis was more sensitive to BTEX while chlorophyll b decreased only at higher concentrations of BTEX. Total chlorophyll content was inhibited by single and mixed BTEX in a dose\u2013response relationship (Figs. 5 and 6 ). The order of response of individual BTEX compounds in terms of EC50 of chlorophyll inhibition was p-xylene> o-xylene>ethylbenzene> m-xylene>toluene>benzene. Based on the individual BTEX dose\u2013response relationship, we constructed a predictive curve for mixed BTEX with equal molar mixture (BTEX-1) using the concentration addition model. The predictive effects proved to be in good agreement with the observed curve by falling within the 95% confident interval of the observed effects as shown in Fig. 6A. The predictive effects were confirmed with the other BTEX mixture, BTEX-2, which represented a typical composition of BTEX in petrol, also showed good agreement with the predictive curve (Fig. 6B).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both components of the BTEX group, which were studied for their effects on chlorophyll content in E. gracilis. The research indicates that chlorophyll a is more sensitive to BTEX compounds, with ethylbenzene showing a specific order of response in terms of chlorophyll inhibition. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the BTEX analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are part of the BTEX group studied for their effects on chlorophyll content, indicating some interaction in the context of toxicity assessment, but lacking a direct comparison or detailed interaction between the two compounds.",
