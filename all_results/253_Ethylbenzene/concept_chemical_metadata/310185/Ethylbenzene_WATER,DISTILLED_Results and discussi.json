    "context": "The water flow-rate was 10 ml/min during the whole experiment. As Fig. 6 shows, peak areas of the more volatile compounds like benzene increased immediately after the start of the concentration pulse (after 50 min) and decreased rapidly in the following analytical cycles when the VOC mixture had been replaced by distilled water again. For these compounds (benzene, trichlororethene and toluene), it took just 10 min to reach the chromatographic baseline again after the end of the step change. By contrast, peak areas of the less volatile compounds ethylbenzene and xylene continued to increase after the end of the step change, and the baseline was not reached until 20 min after the VOC mixture had been replaced by distilled water. Thus, the permeation of these substances is slower, so that compound rests present in the membrane and the tube leading to the sample inlet of the GC result in the delayed response of the system. Memory effects are even more important for lower water flow-rates and larger step changes in concentration. Guo and Mitra observed a time delay of 40 min until a step change of 45 \u03bcg/l benzene to a concentration of 4.5 \u03bcg/l in a water flow of 1 ml/min led to a constant signal using dynamic membrane extraction\u2013GC\u2013FID.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and distilled water are related through their roles in a chromatographic analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights how the presence of distilled water affects the peak areas of ethylbenzene and other VOCs during the experiment. Ethylbenzene's response time to changes in concentration is slower compared to more volatile compounds like benzene, indicating a significant interaction between the two in the context of sample analysis and the effects of water flow rates on compound detection.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene's behavior in the presence of distilled water is discussed in terms of its chromatographic response. However, the relationship is primarily focused on analytical methods rather than a direct chemical or biological interaction.",
