    "context": "In this technique known as membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS), the membrane probe can either be located outside the mass spectrometer in the water sample or directly in the ion source [27\u201330]. Bauer and Cooks have reviewed various inlet configurations and applications of MIMS. Matz and co-authors [32\u201334] used a combination of pervaporation and direct thermodesorption of silicone hollow fibres and developed several membrane probes directly coupled to a mobile GC\u2013MS device for the on-site analysis of contaminated water and application to fermentation processes. Hauser et al. used a mobile gas chromatograph optimised for the continuous monitoring of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) in air to analyse VOCs in water by coupling this device to a membrane extraction module. The specially constructed cell enabled the usage of both flat membranes and hollow fibres. The aim of the investigations described in the following was to develop and test a dynamic membrane extraction cell in combination with this mobile gas chromatograph for the continuous extraction of VOCs, and to use this combination for the field analysis of VOCs in contaminated waters. Reagents and material Analytical-grade methanol was purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); spiking standards of individual compounds were obtained from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in air and water samples using a mobile gas chromatograph. They are part of the BTEX group, which is commonly monitored for environmental contamination. However, the context does not provide specific details about their interactions or comparative significance, focusing instead on the analytical techniques used for their detection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are grouped together as VOCs in the context of environmental monitoring. Their relationship is primarily based on their classification rather than any direct interaction or functional significance.",
        "score": 2
