    "context": "The concentration of ethylbenzene in the air stream was measured by using a gas chromatograph (CE Instruments, GC 8000 model) equipped with a 2.5mL automated gas valve injection system and a flame ionization detector. The chromatographic methods have been described elsewhere (Gabald\u00f3n et al., 2006). Monitoring of the five ports of each biofilter was carried out every 4h by using a time-controlled sequencer. The response of the chromatograph was calibrated by using a synthetic standard mixture of 1920ppmv of toluene and 640ppmv of ethylbenzene in nitrogen gas (Carburos Met\u00e1licos, Spain). Moisture content was determined weekly by the dry-weight method and is expressed as % by weight. Preliminary test without inoculation of biofilters were carried out with both supports to determine the adsorption influence in the VOCs removal. In less than 4h of each run, the inlet and outlet concentrations were almost equal, indicating that adsorption could be considered negligible in comparison with biodegradation by using these packing materials.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and nitrogen gas are related through the calibration of a gas chromatograph used to measure ethylbenzene concentrations in the air stream. Nitrogen gas serves as a component of the synthetic standard mixture for calibration, ensuring accurate measurement of ethylbenzene levels. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship between ethylbenzene and nitrogen gas beyond this calibration purpose.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethylbenzene is measured in the presence of nitrogen gas used for calibration. Their relationship is limited to the context of analytical methods rather than any significant chemical or biological interaction.",
        "score": 2
