    "context": "The reactor was continuously fed with ethylbenzene at a rate of 1mLh\u22121 for a minimum period of 8 weeks. Suspended solids concentration and oxygen uptake rate were controlled twice a week along with periodical purge of excess sludge to get a stable operation. Values of oxygen uptake rate of 1000\u20131500mgL\u22121 day\u22121, for amounts of suspended solids between 2000 and 3000mgL\u22121, were considered as indicative of a suitable performance of the suspended culture. By mixing 1L of this conditioned sludge with the filter material the biofilter seeding was performed.Experimental setup and monitoring of biofilters The ethylbenzene biodegradation was carried out in laboratory-scale biofilters (Fig. 1 ) made of methacrylate, with a total height of 97cm and an internal diameter of 13.6cm. A 10cm head space was used for the waste gas inlet and for nutrient feed, while a 10cm bottom space was used for the treated air outlet and leachate. The biofilter was equipped with five sampling ports to measure VOC concentrations, located at 0 (inlet port), 25, 50, 75, and 97 (outlet port) cm of column height. Additional ports located at 20, 40, 60 and 80cm were used for temperature measurement and to recover bed particles for humidity analyses. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is used as a substrate in a biofilter system made of methacrylate. The biofilter is designed to facilitate the biodegradation of ethylbenzene, indicating that methacrylate serves as a structural material for the biofilter rather than having a direct chemical interaction with ethylbenzene. The relationship is primarily functional, as methacrylate provides the medium for the biodegradation process to occur.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is actively biodegraded in a biofilter constructed from methacrylate. However, the relationship is more about the physical setup and function rather than a direct chemical interaction or metabolic relationship.",
        "score": 3
