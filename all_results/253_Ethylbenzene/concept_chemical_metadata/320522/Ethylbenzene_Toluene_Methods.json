    "context": "The concentration of ethylbenzene in the air stream was measured by using a gas chromatograph (CE Instruments, GC 8000 model) equipped with a 2.5mL automated gas valve injection system and a flame ionization detector. The chromatographic methods have been described elsewhere (Gabald\u00f3n et al., 2006). Monitoring of the five ports of each biofilter was carried out every 4h by using a time-controlled sequencer. The response of the chromatograph was calibrated by using a synthetic standard mixture of 1920ppmv of toluene and 640ppmv of ethylbenzene in nitrogen gas (Carburos Met\u00e1licos, Spain). Moisture content was determined weekly by the dry-weight method and is expressed as % by weight. Preliminary test without inoculation of biofilters were carried out with both supports to determine the adsorption influence in the VOCs removal. In less than 4h of each run, the inlet and outlet concentrations were almost equal, indicating that adsorption could be considered negligible in comparison with biodegradation by using these packing materials.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the air stream using gas chromatography. The study involves a synthetic standard mixture containing both compounds, indicating they are analyzed together for their concentrations. However, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the same analytical method.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of a gas chromatography analysis. They share a general category as VOCs, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
