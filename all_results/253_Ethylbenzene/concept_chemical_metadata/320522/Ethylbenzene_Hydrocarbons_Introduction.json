    "context": "Ortiz et al. (2003) compared the behaviour of different organic and inorganic supports on the biofiltration of benzene, toluene and xylene vapours. The greater removal efficiencies were obtained with a mixture of vermiculite and activated carbon. In order to select a suitable low-cost effective packing material, the performance of laboratory biofilters using two supports was investigated to treat air polluted with high concentrations of ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene was selected as representative of monoaromatic hydrocarbon compounds that are moderately biodegradable. The two supports studied as biofilter media were a natural material cheap and locally abundant in deposits, containing peat, (named \u201csoil amendment\u201d) and a commercial fibrous peat from Poland (named \u201cfibrous peat\u201d). A spontaneous ethylbenzene-degrading microbial population originated from sludge of municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as inoculum. In this work, the effects of operating conditions such as influent ethylbenzene load and empty bed residence time (EBRT) were studied in order to attain the influence of the packing material upon the removal efficiency.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a representative of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, which are a subset of hydrocarbons. The study focuses on the biofiltration of ethylbenzene vapors, highlighting its moderate biodegradability and the performance of different biofilter media in removing this hydrocarbon from polluted air. The relationship is significant as ethylbenzene is a specific example within the broader category of hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and hydrocarbons, as ethylbenzene is explicitly categorized as a monoaromatic hydrocarbon. The study provides evidence of its biodegradability and the effectiveness of biofiltration methods, indicating a clear relationship within the context of environmental bioremediation.",
