    "context": "At this temperature, the loss of the more volatile analytes was lower than 10%. The variables affecting the elimination of solvent (flow and purge time) had been optimized for a similar group of compounds in a previous work, so only other variables such as the final detector temperature and injection time were studied. The final temperature of the injector was studied at two levels: 250 and 300\u00b0C (which is the maximum working temperature recommended for Tenax-TA\u00ae). The analytical signals remained constant for all the compounds, except for toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, whose peak areas increased in the order of 67%, 21% and 24% respectively when a temperature of 300\u00b0C was used. Accordingly, it was decided to use this temperature. Injection times were studied for values ranging between 0.40 and 0.60min. Times shorter than 0.55min did not permit complete desorption of the less volatile compounds while longer times did not afford an improvement in the signal, such that this value was chosen as optimum.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are analyzed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during an experiment assessing the effects of injector temperature on their analytical signals. Both compounds exhibited increased peak areas at higher temperatures, indicating a similar behavior in terms of volatility and response to temperature changes. However, the specific interaction or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated upon beyond their shared analytical conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned in the context of their analytical behavior under varying temperatures, indicating a relationship in their volatility. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific significance beyond this shared analytical condition.",
