    "context": "Other authors propose the use of an internally cooled SPME device or the multiple headspace-SPME technique. Non-separative methods such as HS-MS and purge and membrane (PAM)-MS have also been proposed. Within the VOCs considered in different protocols and legislative norms, trihalomethanes (THMs: chloroform, bromodichloromethane, bromodichloromethane and bromoform) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) are common soil pollutants. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified benzene as being carcinogenic to humans (Group 1); ethylbenzene, chloroform and bromodichloromethane have been considered possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), and toluene, xylenes, dibromochloromethane and bromoform belong to Group 3, which encompasses compounds that are not classifiable as regards their carcinogenicity in humans. The presence of trihalomethanes in the soil can be attributed to many human activities, to their use as coolants in refrigerators, and as propellants and cleaning solvents in industry. They may also derive from irrigation with chlorinated water or leaking drinking water distribution and sewer pipes, since they are generated as subproducts in the water chlorination process. Additionally, there are many studies, especially in the case of chloroform, that have confirmed the formation of these compounds in the soil due to natural processes [45\u201352]. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dibromochloromethane are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are mentioned in relation to their potential carcinogenicity. They are part of broader categories of soil pollutants, specifically BTEX and trihalomethanes, respectively. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or specific relationship between the two compounds beyond their classification as environmental pollutants and their potential health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both ethylbenzene and dibromochloromethane are mentioned as VOCs and potential carcinogens, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other.",
