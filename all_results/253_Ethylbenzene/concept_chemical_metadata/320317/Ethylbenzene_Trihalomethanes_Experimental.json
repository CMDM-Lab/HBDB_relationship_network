    "context": "Recently, a methodology based in the use of a headspace autosampler followed by fast gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, using a programmable temperature vaporizer (PTV), has previously been applied satisfactorily to the determination of VOCs in different liquid matrices [54\u201356]. In the present work, we propose for the first time the use of such a methodological strategy for the determination of THMs and BTEX in soils. With this configuration it is possible to retain the advantages of the simple headspace instrumentation, achieving high sensitivity thanks to the preconcentration of the analytes in the PTV and rapid separation of the compounds via fast gas chromatography. Chemicals The solvents used were purchased from the following sources: methanol was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany); trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform) were from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA); toluene, ethylbenzene and m-xylene from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium), and benzene from Sigma Aldrich (Sleinheim, Germany).Standard solutions and samples 2.2.1 Water samples The analytical conditions of the method were optimized by preparing standard solutions of the four THMs and BTEX in water. A mineral water (with the lowest content of some of these compounds) was used to prepare the standards, since in previous assays with distilled water and ultrapure water, trace concentrations of some of the compounds studied were detected. To perform the measurements, the samples were placed in 10mL vials sealed with silicone septum caps. The vials were placed in the tray of the headspace autosampler and were analyzed under the conditions described in Section 2.3. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and trihalomethanes (THMs) are both mentioned as analytes in a proposed methodology for determining volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil samples. The methodology utilizes headspace autosampling and gas chromatography to achieve high sensitivity in detecting these compounds. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions or specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and trihalomethanes are both part of the same analytical study but are not directly related in terms of chemical interaction or functional significance within the context.",
        "score": 2
