    "context": "Other authors propose the use of an internally cooled SPME device or the multiple headspace-SPME technique. Non-separative methods such as HS-MS and purge and membrane (PAM)-MS have also been proposed. Within the VOCs considered in different protocols and legislative norms, trihalomethanes (THMs: chloroform, bromodichloromethane, bromodichloromethane and bromoform) and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) are common soil pollutants. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified benzene as being carcinogenic to humans (Group 1); ethylbenzene, chloroform and bromodichloromethane have been considered possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), and toluene, xylenes, dibromochloromethane and bromoform belong to Group 3, which encompasses compounds that are not classifiable as regards their carcinogenicity in humans. The presence of trihalomethanes in the soil can be attributed to many human activities, to their use as coolants in refrigerators, and as propellants and cleaning solvents in industry. They may also derive from irrigation with chlorinated water or leaking drinking water distribution and sewer pipes, since they are generated as subproducts in the water chlorination process. Additionally, there are many studies, especially in the case of chloroform, that have confirmed the formation of these compounds in the soil due to natural processes [45\u201352]. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of the BTEX group, which are common soil pollutants. The discussion highlights their potential carcinogenicity, with toluene being classified as not classifiable regarding its carcinogenicity, while ethylbenzene is considered possibly carcinogenic. Both compounds are linked through their environmental impact and regulatory classifications, but no direct interaction or specific relationship is detailed beyond their shared categorization as pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX group and discussed in terms of their carcinogenic classifications. However, their relationship is primarily based on their shared characteristics as pollutants rather than a direct interaction.",
