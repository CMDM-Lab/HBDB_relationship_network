    "context": "The physiology of plants stomata of each species, the physico-chemical properties of plants cuticles and the physico-chemical properties of the pollutants including its water solubility or lipophilicity might be important factors that affect the uptake efficiency of each species (Simonich and Hites, 1995). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the removal of toluene and ethylbenzene by plants along with the affecting factors, including stomata and cuticular, on toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency. The twelve plant species studied for toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency were Aloe vera, Sansevieria masoniana, Sansevieria trifasciata, Sansevieria hyacinthoides, Sansevieria ehrenbergii, Kalanchoe blossfeldiana, Dracaena deremensis \u2018Lemon lime\u2019, Dracaena sanderiana, Codiaeum variegatum, Chlorophytum comosum, Cordyline fruticosa and Aglaonema commutatum. Screening plants for toluene and ethylbenzene removal The twelve plant species were purchased from ornamental plant shops in Thailand. In order to get all test plants of similar leaf area, the twelve plant species leaf areas were measured by graph paper. The leaf area of 0.013m2 was chosen for the experiment. Before initiating the experiments, plants were cleaned with tap and distilled water to disperse soil particles. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its removal efficiency by various plant species, while endemic flea-borne typhus is not mentioned or connected to the study. The focus is on the physico-chemical properties of pollutants like ethylbenzene and their interaction with plant physiology, with no relevance to flea-borne typhus.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relationship between ethylbenzene and endemic flea-borne typhus, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any direct or indirect connection.",
