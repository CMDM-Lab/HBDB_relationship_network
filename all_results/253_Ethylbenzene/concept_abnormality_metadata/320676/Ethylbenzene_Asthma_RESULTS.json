    "context": "[1] The ORs were adjusted for the effects of relative humidity and indoor temperature. [2] Other potential confounding factors such as child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age, sex, child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allergy, family history of asthma, socioeconomic status, smoking indoors, season, air conditioning, house dust mites, and gas appliances were also considered in the analysis. [3] Having controlled for these potential confounding variables, children exposed to concentrations of total VOCs of \u00e2\u00a9\u00be60 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (median level of exposure) had a fourfold increased risk of having asthma while children exposed to single compounds such as benzene at levels of \u00e2\u00a9\u00be20 \u00ce\u00bcg/m3 (median level of exposure) had an eightfold increased risk of asthma (fig 2). [1] Most of the individual VOCs appeared to be significant risk factors for asthma with the highest ORs for benzene followed by ethylbenzene and toluene (fig 3). [2] For every 10 unit increase in the concentrations of toluene and benzene (\u00ce\u00bcg/m3) the risk of having asthma increased by almost two and three times, respectively.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a significant risk factor for asthma, particularly among children exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study indicates that exposure to ethylbenzene, along with other VOCs like benzene and toluene, correlates with increased odds ratios (ORs) for developing asthma. Specifically, ethylbenzene exposure contributes to a heightened risk, emphasizing its relevance in indoor air quality and public health concerns regarding asthma prevalence.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and asthma, supported by statistical data showing increased risk associated with exposure levels. The context highlights ethylbenzene as a notable VOC linked to asthma, indicating a significant health impact.",
        "score": 4
