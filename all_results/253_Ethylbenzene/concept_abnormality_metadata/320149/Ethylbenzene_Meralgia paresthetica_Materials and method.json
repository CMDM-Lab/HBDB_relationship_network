    "context": "In case the partitioning is controlled by adsorption at the liquid\u2013air or solid\u2013liquid interfaces the interfacial layers should be considered as individual element of multiphase system. Hence, the air/water partitioning could be considered as the partitioning of the chemicals between the sorption layers on the water surface from air and water sides. The equilibrium constant of this surface partitioning can be expressed as the ratio between adsorption coefficients: (4) K sp = K IW K IA where KIA and KIW are interfacial adsorption coefficients of compounds (m3 m\u22122) (defined as the ratio of the interfacial concentration in units of molm\u22122 of surface and the bulk phase concentration of compounds in units of molm\u22123). Experimental values for the sorption to the water surface are less common, but sorption coefficient values can be estimated using a poly-parameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER) (Roth et al., 2002). To describe interface-bulk mass transport and the physicochemical processes at the interfaces, it is useful to define the phases adjacent to the adsorption layer as the \u201cnear-interface\u201d phases (P\u00f6schl et al., 2007). These phases can be regarded as the region from which a molecule of the investigated substances can directly interact and undergo exchange with the molecules in the interfacial layers (Fig. 1). The concentration of organic compounds in the near-surface water phase (Cns - w ) is equal to the ratio between the surface concentration (Csurface - water ) and the sorption coefficient (KIW ) on the water surface from the water side: (5) C ns - w = C surface - water K IW Since the concentration of compounds in the water surface layer from the water and gas sides could be assumed equal, the expression for the near-surface water concentration takes the form: (6) C ns - w = C air \u00b7 K IA K IW where the ratio KIW /KIA corresponds to the dimensionless Henry\u2019s law constant (Lei and Wania, 2004).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its physicochemical properties and partitioning behavior in multiphase systems, particularly concerning adsorption at interfaces. However, there is no mention or implication of a relationship between ethylbenzene and meralgia paresthetica, a condition characterized by nerve compression leading to pain and numbness in the thigh. The two terms appear unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects the lack of any direct or indirect relationship between ethylbenzene and meralgia paresthetica in the context. They are mentioned in separate discussions without any connection or relevance to each other.",
