    "context": "These concentrations did not lead to cell death, as verified by trypan blue exclusion (not shown). Among BTEX, benzene was found to be the less cytotoxic as a significant decrease of proliferation rate was induced for doses higher than 1 mM and the NOEC was 500 \u03bcM. Toluene toxicity appeared at about five times lower doses (NOEC=100 \u03bcM). Xylene and ethylbenzene showed a NOEC of 50 \u03bcM and induced almost complete arrest of cell growth at 1 mM. The NOEC of monochlorobenzene (mono-ClB) was found to be similar to that of xylene and ethylbenzene. Conversely, the toxicity of others chlorobenzenes was higher than that of BTEX and increased as a function of the number of Cl, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2 . Indeed, cell growth-NOEC decreased from benzene to mono-ClB, 1,3-ClB, 1,2,3-ClB and 1,2,3,4-ClB. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is evaluated for its effects on cell growth, with a reported NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration) of 50 \u03bcM, indicating that concentrations above this threshold lead to significant inhibition of cell proliferation. At 1 mM, ethylbenzene caused almost complete arrest of cell growth, highlighting its cytotoxic potential compared to other BTEX compounds. This suggests a direct and detrimental relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and cell growth inhibition.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and cell growth, supported by quantitative data on NOEC values and their impact on cell proliferation. The context clearly indicates that ethylbenzene affects cell growth, making it a relevant factor in cytotoxicity studies.",
        "score": 4
