    "context": "[4] The two-way vehicle count during the experiment was 4179 (17:00 to 18:00 h) and 2958 (18:00 to 19:00 h). [1] The results of the BTEX ambient air concentration measurements are given in table 1. [2] The benzene level based on the time period of the study and the ethylbenzene results are semiquantitative because the analyte was detected at a level above the linear response of calibration curve. [1] The detection limits of the assay were estimated at 0.5 ng/ml based on a signal:noise ratio of 3. Precision, estimated using the ratio between D8 toluene:D10 ethylbenzene and D10 ethylbenzene:D10 o-xylene from all samples, was 6.9% RSD and 4.9% RSD respectively. [2] Accuracy at 0.5 ng/ml was +2.3%, \u00e2\u02c6\u20193.5%, \u00e2\u02c6\u20195.6%, \u00e2\u02c6\u20197.5% and \u00e2\u02c6\u20194.2% for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m/p-xylene and o-xylene, respectively. [3] A GC-MS chromatogram of an exercising subject is shown in fig 1 containing BTEX and deuterated standards. [4] Chromatographic conditions did not allow resolution of m- and p-xylene, and these peak areas were combined. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to ambient air concentration measurements of BTEX compounds, which include benzene, toluene, and xylene. However, there is no direct discussion or connection established between ethylbenzene and noise. The mention of noise appears to be incidental, as the focus is primarily on the chemical analysis rather than any auditory implications or interactions with ethylbenzene.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between ethylbenzene and noise, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
