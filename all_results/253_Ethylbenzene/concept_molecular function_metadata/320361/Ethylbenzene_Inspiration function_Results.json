    "context": "[1] The mean (SD) heart rate (beats per minute) measured during the field experiment was significantly elevated compared with resting values (185.3 (3.2) vs 69.4 (4.5); p<0.001). [2] The average ventilation (l/min) during exercise was significantly elevated (86.2 (2.3) vs 8.7 (0.9); p<0.001). [3] Based on BTEX exposure levels (benzene was not detected), the cumulative inhaled mass over the period of exercise in the field was estimated at 92 \u00ce\u00bcg, 738 \u00ce\u00bcg and 138 \u00ce\u00bcg for toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, respectively. [4] The cumulative inhaled mass over the same period at rest was estimated at 9 \u00ce\u00bcg, 74 \u00ce\u00bcg and 14 \u00ce\u00bcg for toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, respectively. [5] The mean (SD) exercise intensity (%HRmax) was estimated at 93(2.3)%. [1] The BTEX environmental levels detected in this microenvironment were in general agreement with other international reports of traffic-related emissions. [2] Environmental BTEX levels associated with transport related pollution vary widely and depend on many factors including traffic density and the microenvironment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to BTEX exposure levels during exercise, where cumulative inhaled mass was significantly higher during physical activity compared to rest. While ethylbenzene is part of the BTEX group, the specific impact of ethylbenzene on inspiration function is not directly discussed, leaving its relationship to respiratory function somewhat implied rather than explicitly defined.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between ethylbenzene and inspiration function, as both are mentioned in the context of exercise and inhalation exposure. However, there is no detailed discussion of how ethylbenzene specifically affects respiratory function.",
