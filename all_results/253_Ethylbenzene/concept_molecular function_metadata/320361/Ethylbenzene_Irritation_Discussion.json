    "context": "[2] Typically there is around 10-fold greater exposure to benzene via cigarette smoke, and blood benzene and toluene levels in smokers have been shown to be around double that in non-smokers, While there was an approximate doubling of blood levels of toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene in this study during short intensive exercise, given the short exposure duration, there is the potential for more rapid elimination than would be expected from chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke. [3] Additionally, it must be remembered that benzene was not observed in the environmental sampling or significantly increased in blood. [4] Based on the environmental levels alone, apart from potential respiratory effects, the risk of other serious health effects due to toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene in this study appears low. [5] The American Conference of Industrial Hygienists recommends a threshold limit value\u00e2\u20ac\u201ctime-weighted average (TLV-TWA) of 50 ppm for toluene based on subtle neurological impairment, a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm for ethylbenzene based on irritation and central nervous system effects and a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm for xylene isomers (o-, m-, p-) based on irritation to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin. [6] Toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene are not listed as known or anticipated human carcinogens by the US National Toxicology Program, but ethylbenzene is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a possible human carcinogen based on evidence in animals. [7] This is in stark contrast to benzene with a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm and classification as a carcinogen in humans. [1] In conclusion, high-intensity roadside running, although of short duration, has the potential to expose runners to relatively high amounts of BTEX mass which can be observed in increased blood concentrations.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is associated with irritation, as indicated by the American Conference of Industrial Hygienists' recommendation of a threshold limit value (TLV-TWA) of 100 ppm for ethylbenzene based on its potential to cause irritation and central nervous system effects. This suggests that exposure to ethylbenzene can lead to irritation of the respiratory tract, eyes, and skin, highlighting its relevance in occupational health and safety discussions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and irritation, supported by specific threshold limit values indicating health risks associated with exposure. The context provides clear evidence of ethylbenzene's potential to cause irritation, making it a relevant concern in occupational settings.",
