Hexane and cyclohexane attained peak concentration of 64.63 and 53.92\u03bcgm\u22123 at 6th day and then decreased. Methyl-cyclohexane was measured in relatively low concentrations of no higher than 3.87\u03bcgm\u22123 during the entire composting process. MSWs biostabilization process emitted relatively high concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, ethyltoluene, at the range of 73.84\u2013728.23\u03bcgtoluenem\u22123, 1190.67\u20134587.43\u03bcgethylbenzenem\u22123, 1973.25\u20138099.69\u03bcgxylenem\u22123 and 84.58\u2013917.22\u03bcgethyltoluenem\u22123, ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted during the biostabilization process of municipal solid waste (MSW). The study highlights the concentration levels of ethylbenzene alongside other VOCs like toluene and xylene, indicating its relevance in the emissions profile of the process. However, there is no detailed discussion of how ethylbenzene specifically interacts with or affects the biostabilization process itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethylbenzene is part of the emissions measured during the biostabilization process, but there is no specific analysis of its role or impact within that process.",
