    "context": "With increasing feasibility and reliability in genomic technologies to probe for diseases and an awareness of the practical limitations of collecting liver tissue specimens posed by VOCs, the need for reliable blood-based biomarkers that can report on disease status has grown enormously. We therefore chose blood mononuclear cells as a relevant target for this study. Thus, identifying the global genomic response through changes in RNA expression in blood may provide an important tool for developing predictable indicators for a toxicologic index using a non-invasive method. In this study, to gain more insight into expression profiles in whole blood that shows a characteristic molecular signature by treatment with VOCs, we treated 11-week-old SD male rats with low- and high-doses of three VOCs (DCM, EB, and TCE) and identified the consequent changes in global gene expression profiles in rat whole blood by expression genomics analysis. Materials and methods Animals and chemical treatments The three volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Single, high- and low-dose compounds were administered to seven males of 11-week-old Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, respectively. Twelve males that administered with corn-oil were studied as experimental control. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) administered to rats to study its effects on global gene expression profiles in blood. The research aims to identify changes in RNA expression as a potential biomarker for toxicity, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and alterations in gene expression. This suggests that ethylbenzene can influence molecular responses in biological systems, highlighting its relevance in toxicological studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and gene expression, as the study investigates how exposure to ethylbenzene affects RNA expression in blood, providing evidence of its impact on gene expression profiles.",
        "score": 4
