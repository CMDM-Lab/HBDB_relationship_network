    "context": "This tool maps genes to known pathways and provides a summary of the biological processes affected. Based on this database analysis, we identified 7 pathways that containing at least 4 genetic elements mapped in pathways from 337 genes of molecular signature. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 , the major signaling pathways affected in the rat whole blood exposed with VOCs were identified as follows: the hematopoietic cell lineage pathway, the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway, the antigen processing and presentation pathway, the cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction pathways, T cell receptor signaling pathway, the Jak\u2013STAT signaling pathway, and the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (Table 1 ). Biochemical validation of discernable molecular markers that are differentially expressed in rat whole blood by VOCs To validate gene expression data of microarrays and to confirm transcriptional levels of differentially expressed genes, we selected significantly deregulated genes from microarrays data of each toxicant (DCM, EB, and TCE) treatment group and, performed quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis. As shown in Figs. 5A and B, transcriptional levels of 4 genes (FGCR1A, CD38, RT1-BA and IL2RG) that were significantly up-regulated in all three toxicants exposure group, and another 4 genes (GP1BB, PVRL3, NCAM1 and CCL5) that were significantly down-regulated in all three toxicants groups were compared to their corresponding controls. The GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control for all genes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that affect gene expression in rat whole blood. The study highlights the transcriptional levels of several genes that were significantly altered following exposure to EB, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and genetic transcription changes. The analysis involved quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) to validate the expression of these genes, demonstrating that EB exposure can lead to significant transcriptional deregulation in specific pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and genetic transcription, as the study provides evidence of altered gene expression due to EB exposure, supported by quantitative analysis. This indicates a significant biological impact of ethylbenzene on transcriptional processes.",
        "score": 4
