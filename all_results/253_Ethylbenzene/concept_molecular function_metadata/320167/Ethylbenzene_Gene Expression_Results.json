    "context": "This tool maps genes to known pathways and provides a summary of the biological processes affected. Based on this database analysis, we identified 7 pathways that containing at least 4 genetic elements mapped in pathways from 337 genes of molecular signature. As shown in Fig.\u00a04 , the major signaling pathways affected in the rat whole blood exposed with VOCs were identified as follows: the hematopoietic cell lineage pathway, the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway, the antigen processing and presentation pathway, the cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction pathways, T cell receptor signaling pathway, the Jak\u2013STAT signaling pathway, and the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (Table 1 ). Biochemical validation of discernable molecular markers that are differentially expressed in rat whole blood by VOCs To validate gene expression data of microarrays and to confirm transcriptional levels of differentially expressed genes, we selected significantly deregulated genes from microarrays data of each toxicant (DCM, EB, and TCE) treatment group and, performed quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis. As shown in Figs. 5A and B, transcriptional levels of 4 genes (FGCR1A, CD38, RT1-BA and IL2RG) that were significantly up-regulated in all three toxicants exposure group, and another 4 genes (GP1BB, PVRL3, NCAM1 and CCL5) that were significantly down-regulated in all three toxicants groups were compared to their corresponding controls. The GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control for all genes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is linked to gene expression through a study examining the effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on transcriptional changes in rat whole blood. The analysis identified differentially expressed genes in response to EB exposure, alongside other toxicants, highlighting the impact of EB on specific signaling pathways and gene regulation. The study utilized quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) to validate these gene expression changes, indicating a direct relationship between EB exposure and alterations in gene expression profiles.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and gene expression, supported by evidence of transcriptional changes in response to EB exposure. The study provides quantitative validation of gene expression alterations, indicating a clear relationship within the context of biochemical responses to VOCs.",
