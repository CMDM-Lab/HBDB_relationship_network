    "context": "Among all of the VOC species, toluene has the highest concentration. High concentrations of chlorinated compounds were found at Kwai Chung where it is located in an industrial area with industrial emissions. Hok Tsui served as a background station with VOC concentrations less than 10 \u03bcg/m3 since there were no significant anthropologenic sources. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) were mainly from vehicle exhausts, while chlorinated compounds were mainly from industries, cleaning processes and chemical solvents. However, mixed sources were frequently observed at Mong Kok and Causeway Bay. The concentrations of VOCs in Hong Kong were similar to other cities in the world. However, the ratios of T/B (average T/B ratio=5) were higher in Hong Kong than that of other cities (average T/B ratio=2 or 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) alongside toluene and benzene, which are primarily sourced from vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions. The term 'process' refers to the various industrial and cleaning activities contributing to VOC emissions, including those involving ethylbenzene. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and specific processes is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association rather than a detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethylbenzene is categorized with other VOCs linked to industrial processes, but there is no specific discussion of its role or interaction within those processes.",
