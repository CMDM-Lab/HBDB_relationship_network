    "context": "The sampling and analytical methods employed for the chamber test were also utilized for this in-vehicle test. Frequency of occurrence The AFs emitted 84 compounds, and all 26 household products emitted at least one compound. Nevertheless, Table 1 presents the frequency of occurrence for the 50 analytes that satisfied the cut-off point for the reporting compounds, as described above. Eleven analytes occurred at a frequency of more than 50%: toluene (100%), bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene (96%), benzene (92%), hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (81%), pentadecane (81%), ethanol (65%), ethyl benzene (62%), limonene (58%), m,p-xylene (57%), and tetramethylsilane (50%). Among these 11 compounds, five compounds (toluene, benzene, ethyl benzene, and m,p-xylene) are listed as either a toxic air contaminant, a hazardous air pollutant, or as being on California\u2032s Proposition 65 List (OEHHA, 2003). The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) suggested the guidelines of 200, 1, 100, and 100 parts per million (ppm) for toluene, benzene, ethyl benzene, and xylene, respectively (OSHA, 1998). These toxic or hazardous compounds are prevalent in households or public buildings and can be caused by a variety of sources (Tucker, 2000; Edwards et al., 2005; Zuraimi et al., 2006). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the analytes emitted from household products, with a reported occurrence frequency of 62%. It is categorized alongside other compounds that are considered toxic or hazardous air pollutants. The mention of ethylbenzene as an analyte indicates its relevance in the analysis of air quality and potential health risks associated with exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is classified as an analyte in the context of air quality testing. While it is part of a broader analysis of hazardous compounds, the specific interactions or implications of ethylbenzene as an analyte are not deeply explored.",
