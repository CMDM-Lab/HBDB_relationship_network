    "context": "Fig. 4 shows that concentrations in the polymer phase are much higher than the aqueous phase concentrations, as expected. For all step changes, the trends for individual BTEX components in the polymer phase are similar to those observed in the aqueous phase. An exception to this can be seen for the step change of 6\u00d7, wherein benzene has the lowest polymer phase concentration (Fig. 4c), but the highest aqueous phase concentration (Fig. 3c). This, however, is expected, as partition coefficients that were measured during the polymer phase selection process for silicone rubber revealed that BTEX components have partition coefficients (mgL\u22121 gas phase L mg\u22121 liquid phase) in the following order: ethylbenzene (593\u00b15)> o-xylene (414\u00b12)>toluene (200\u00b14)>benzene (62\u00b12) and thus, as benzene concentrations in the aqueous phase are not exceptionally higher than the other BTEX compounds, benzene concentrations in the polymer phase are expected to be lower than the other BTEX compounds. An important point shown by Fig. 4 is that polymers appear to effectively buffer large concentrations of BTEX compounds in a solid\u2013liquid TPPB. This is the first study to monitor polymer phase concentrations during transient loadings applied to a TPPB to reveal conclusively that uptake by polymers is responsible for the increased performance of a solid\u2013liquid TPPB relative to a single phase reactor. With the polymer phase composing only 10% of the total working volume of the reactor, the polymer beads accounted for 93%, 91% and 70% of the total BTEX present in the working volume for step changes of 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7 and 6\u00d7, respectively (at t =237min).System comparison and limitations There is difficulty in comparing the system in the present work (well mixed) to biofiltration methods (plug flow) as the responsiveness of these systems are dissimilar and the step changes tested on biofilters are typically longer.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its partitioning behavior in a polymer phase during a solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) process. The study highlights how ethylbenzene, along with other BTEX compounds, exhibits specific partition coefficients that influence its concentration in both the polymer and aqueous phases. This indicates that the process of using polymers in TPPB systems significantly enhances the uptake and performance of ethylbenzene removal compared to traditional single-phase reactors.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and the TPPB process, supported by quantitative data on partition coefficients and the role of polymers in enhancing BTEX compound uptake. The relationship is clear and relevant to the context of bioreactor performance.",
