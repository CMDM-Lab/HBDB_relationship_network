    "context": "Most concentrations of esters, chlorinated compounds and organic nitriles were less than 100\u03bcgm\u22123 (Table 4 ). Of the emissions from PP production lines, toluene was still the highest respective hydrocarbons with values of 220\u2013374\u03bcgm\u22123, but acetone with high concentration of 4 552\u03bcgm\u22123 was detected in one sample (Table 4). Combining the VOCs analysis results inside the PE/PP plastic waste recycling plants revealed that the volatile compounds emitted from the melting and powdering processes were mainly hydrocarbons and ketones. Referring to the olfactory threshold of individual compounds, ethylbenzene and acrolein in several samples exceeded human olfactory thresholds, and this indicated these compounds played the key roles to contribute the odor inside PE/PP plastic waste recycling plant. In particular of acrolein, one sample with concentration of 847\u03bcgm\u22123 (370ppb) exceeded the short-term exposure level limit (300ppb) published by National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, United States (NIOSH, 2005), which represented a potential health risk for employees because acrolein was known to be mutagenic and carcinogenic (IARC, 1995). The emissions produced by the melting and powdering processes inside the PVC plastic waste recycling plant also produce pungent malodor, and odor concentrations reached 447\u20131315 OC (Table 3). The odor levels were higher than those inside the PE/PP plastic waste recycling plants (100\u2013300 OC), and this result could reflect on the olfactometric results of boundaries that odor concentration for the PVC plant was higher than those for the PE/PP plants (Table 2).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to olfactory thresholds, indicating that its concentration in the emissions from plastic waste recycling plants exceeded human olfactory thresholds. This suggests that ethylbenzene contributes significantly to the odor perceived in these environments, highlighting its relevance in assessing potential health risks associated with exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and olfactory thresholds, as the context indicates that its concentration surpasses the olfactory threshold, thereby contributing to the odor in the recycling plants. This relationship is supported by the context's focus on VOCs and their impact on human perception.",
        "score": 4
