    "context": "The water flow-rate was 10 ml/min during the whole experiment. As Fig. 6 shows, peak areas of the more volatile compounds like benzene increased immediately after the start of the concentration pulse (after 50 min) and decreased rapidly in the following analytical cycles when the VOC mixture had been replaced by distilled water again. For these compounds (benzene, trichlororethene and toluene), it took just 10 min to reach the chromatographic baseline again after the end of the step change. By contrast, peak areas of the less volatile compounds ethylbenzene and xylene continued to increase after the end of the step change, and the baseline was not reached until 20 min after the VOC mixture had been replaced by distilled water. Thus, the permeation of these substances is slower, so that compound rests present in the membrane and the tube leading to the sample inlet of the GC result in the delayed response of the system. Memory effects are even more important for lower water flow-rates and larger step changes in concentration. Guo and Mitra observed a time delay of 40 min until a step change of 45 \u03bcg/l benzene to a concentration of 4.5 \u03bcg/l in a water flow of 1 ml/min led to a constant signal using dynamic membrane extraction\u2013GC\u2013FID.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed as a less volatile compound compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene and toluene. The study highlights the differences in response times of various volatile substances during a concentration pulse experiment, indicating that ethylbenzene has a slower permeation rate and delayed response in chromatographic analysis. This suggests that ethylbenzene is part of the broader category of volatile substances, but its behavior in the experiment is distinct due to its lower volatility.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethylbenzene is categorized as a volatile substance, and the context discusses its specific behavior in relation to other VOCs. However, the relationship is primarily observational rather than indicating a direct interaction or significant functional connection.",
