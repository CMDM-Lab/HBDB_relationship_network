    "context": "It may also enter the body by skin contact. Short term exposure to high levels of ethylbenzene may cause irritation of eye and throat. Exposure may also result in vertigo and dizziness. Long term exposure to low levels ethylbenzene can result in irreversible damage to the inner ear and hearing among animals. If the exposure lasts several months and years, kidney damage may result in animals. Cigarette smoke contains ethylbenzene and as such smokers have been found to have higher levels of ethylbenzene than nonsmokers.O-xylene O-xylene, a colorless liquid is used in the manufacture of phthalic anhydride, vitamin and pharmaceutical syntheses, dyes, insecticides, motor fuels (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/o-xylene#section=Toxicity-Summary). Exposure to o-xylene can result in severe toxic effects or symptoms of illness depending up on the level and duration of exposure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is linked to hearing through its potential toxic effects on the inner ear. Short-term exposure to high levels can cause dizziness and vertigo, while long-term exposure to lower levels has been associated with irreversible damage to hearing in animals. This suggests a significant relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and auditory health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylbenzene and hearing, as the context provides evidence of irreversible damage to the inner ear due to prolonged exposure, indicating a clear health risk associated with ethylbenzene.",
        "score": 4
