    "context": "Different kinetic equations were tested with data obtained during the studies with Bacillus sp. and with Pseudomonas sp. in order to quantify the effect of each heavy metal on biodegradation of alkylbenzenes. Although the heavy metals are not the growth substrates, the effect on substrate (toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene) removal kinetics with increasing heavy metals concentrations could be modeled mathematically using the Andrews model (Andrews, 1968). This model is usually used for quantifying microbial growth rates with inhibition but was considered to be an appropriate model since alkylbenzene removal rates appeared to be directly linked to microbial growth response for both strains used in this study (Fig. 3 ), although reports describing this application of the kinetic equation on media containing heavy metals are minimal. The heavy metals inhibition constants (K i) for VOC removal were calculated according to the equation: r=r max S K s +S+(S2/K i ) , where r max is the maximum toluene, ethylbenzene or o-xylene degradation rate, S is the heavy metal concentration and K s represents a substrate concentration called the Monod constant. However, since in the heavy metal concentration range tested only inhibitory effects were observed, the equation was simplified by considering that K s was negligible (S\u226bK): 1 r = 1 r max + S K i r max . In such cases, a plot of (degradation rate)\u22121 versus heavy metal concentrations should yield a straight line. The experimental data obtained with Bacillus conformed with Andrews kinetics when plotting the reciprocal of degradation rate versus heavy metal concentrations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and o-xylene are both mentioned as substrates undergoing biodegradation by microbial strains Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. The study focuses on modeling the effects of heavy metals on the removal kinetics of these alkylbenzenes, indicating a relationship where both compounds are part of the same degradation process. However, the specific catabolism of o-xylene is not detailed in relation to ethylbenzene, limiting the depth of their interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both ethylbenzene and o-xylene are involved in the same biodegradation study, but their specific catabolic interactions are not elaborated upon, indicating a shared significance rather than a direct relationship.",
