    "context": "The wax composition of twelve species was analyzed and the results showed that the wax of S. trifasciata and S. hyacinthoides, which had greater absorption of toluene and ethylbenzene, contained high hexadecanoic acid and alpha-linolenic acid was not found in their cuticular wax. Thus, hexadecanoic acid might be involved in toluene and ethylbenzene adsorption by cuticle wax of plants. Therefore, for the maximum improvement of VOCs from contaminant air by plants, the correlation of cuticle composition of each plant species and the physicochemical properties of the pollutants is an important factor and should be of interest. Furthermore, there was a significant difference of chlorophyll fluorescence or the Fv/Fm ratio between the control and the treated plants in D. deremensis \u2018Lemon lime\u2019, D. sanderiana, K. blossfeldiana and C. fruticosa after exposure to ethylbenzene for 72h, showing a correlation between the health and the function of the photosynthetic process and VOC uptake of plants. Therefore, the chlorophyll fluorescence analysis can give insight into the ability of plant to tolerate air pollution. This index can be used for identification of suitable plants for treating VOC-contaminated air. Landfill biogas (LFG) is produced under anaerobic conditions by the biodegradation of the waste materials (Chiriac et al., 2007). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is linked to photosynthesis through its impact on plant health and function. The study indicates that exposure to ethylbenzene affects chlorophyll fluorescence, which is a measure of photosynthetic efficiency. This suggests that the ability of plants to tolerate air pollution, including ethylbenzene, is crucial for maintaining their photosynthetic processes, highlighting the importance of cuticle composition in VOC uptake and plant health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and photosynthesis, as the context provides evidence of ethylbenzene's impact on chlorophyll fluorescence, indicating a clear relationship between VOC exposure and photosynthetic function in plants.",
        "score": 4
