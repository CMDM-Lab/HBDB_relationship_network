    "context": "In this experiment, leaf Fv/Fm ratios were measured to give information on potential photosynthetic efficiency or the potential quantum yield of PSII between control and treated plants. Fm is the fluorescence to a maximum value, while Fv is the variable fluorescence. Photosynthesis in the control and the treated plants was determined by measurement with an FMS-2 portable pulse-modulated fluorometer. Leaves were clipped and allowed 5min for darkness adaptation before measurements were carried out.Effect of cuticle on toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency Cuticle was extracted from a 0.013m2 leaf area of the highest and lowest toluene and ethylbenzene removal efficiency plants by hexane and transferred onto an aluminum plate (size ~0.013m2). Hexane was evaporated and wax was then fumigated with 20ppm of toluene or ethylbenzene to study the removal efficiency. There were three replicates in each treatment. The gas sample was taken from a fumigation chamber at 72h to be analyzed by GC.Composition of cuticular wax analysis Cuticular wax of the twelve plants was analyzed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to its removal efficiency from plant cuticles, while dark adaptation refers to the process of leaves adjusting to darkness before measuring photosynthetic efficiency. However, there is no direct connection or interaction discussed between ethylbenzene and dark adaptation, as they are part of separate experimental procedures without a clear relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as ethylbenzene and dark adaptation are mentioned in the same context but do not interact or influence each other in any meaningful way. Their mention is coincidental without any direct relevance.",
