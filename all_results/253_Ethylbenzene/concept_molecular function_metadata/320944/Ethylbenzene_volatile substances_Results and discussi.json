    "context": "The electron impact technique (70eV) was used and scanned at 30\u201350amu conditions for mass analysis.Statistical analysis A completely randomized design was used for the experiments. The data were statistically analyzed using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), SPSS version 20. Significantly different means were assessed by Duncan\u05f3s multiple range tests at a 95 percent confidence level. Screening plant for toluene and ethylbenzene removal Twelve plant species were obtained from commercial sources and were screened for their ability to remove toluene and ethylbenzene volatile compounds. In this experiment we found that 2\u20134 percent of toluene or ethylbenzene was lost through photodegradation. The results for comparative rates and final removal of toluene and ethylbenzene across the twelve species showed convergent trends over 72h ( Fig. 1A). The final removal of toluene averaged ~77 percent of the dose across twelve plant species. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a volatile compound alongside toluene, both of which were screened for their removal by various plant species. The study highlights the ability of these plants to degrade and remove volatile substances, specifically focusing on the comparative rates of ethylbenzene and toluene removal. The mention of ethylbenzene in relation to volatile compounds indicates its role as a target for environmental remediation efforts involving plant species.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and volatile substances, as the study specifically investigates the removal of ethylbenzene as a volatile compound by plants, providing evidence of its relevance in environmental contexts.",
        "score": 4
