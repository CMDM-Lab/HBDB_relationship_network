    "context": "Seal and shake the separatory funnel vigorously for \u223c3 min with periodic venting to release excess pressure. DCM creates excessive pressure rapidly, therefore, initial venting should be done immediately after the separatory funnel has been sealed and shaken once. Upon completion of extractions, the extracts of samples A and B were combined, filtered and dried by passing through anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated to approximately 0.5 ml using rotary evaporation and nitrogen blow-down techniques. The concentrated extract was then spiked with internal standards {5-\u03b1-androstane for determination of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and n-alkane distribution, [2H10]ethylbenzene for BTEX and other alkylbenzene analysis, [2H14]terphenyl (terphenyl-d 14) for PAH analysis, and C30-\u03b2\u03b2-hopane for biomarker analysis}, and then adjusted to 1.00 ml prior to GC analyses.Capillary GC and GC\u2013MS Analyses for alkane distribution and TPHs were performed on an Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector and an HP 7673 autosampler. Analyses of PAHs and biomarker compounds were performed on an HP 5890 GC/HP 5972 mass-selective detector. System control and data acquisition were achieved with an HP G1034C MS ChemStation (DOS series). GC\u2013FID analysis provides a baseline resolution of n-alkanes from n-C8 to n-C41 and n-C17\u2013pristane and n-C18\u2013phytane. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as an internal standard for the analysis of BTEX and other alkylbenzenes during gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. However, there is no discussion or indication of a relationship between ethylbenzene and adjudication, which appears to be unrelated to the chemical analysis process described.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between ethylbenzene and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct connection or interaction discussed.",
