    "context": "The negative control comprised ultra-pure water and the positive control methyl methanesulfonate \u2013 MMS (CAS No. 66-27-3) at 4\u00d710\u22124 M. These same five samples of BTEX were submitted to a biodegradation process by bacteria selected from a raw effluent of a petroleum refinery. The method used to perform the biodegradation was the one described by Mazzeo et al. (2010). After this process, the biodegraded samples presented the following concentration: BTEX 1 (benzene: 322.25mgL\u22121, toluene: 63.7mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 14.8mgL\u22121 and xylene: 4.04mgL\u22121), BTEX 2 (benzene: 20.7mgL\u22121, toluene: 2.5mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 0.3mgL\u22121 and xylene: 0.4mgL\u22121), BTEX 3 (benzene: 0.08mgL\u22121, toluene: 0.03mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: 0.01mgL\u22121, xylene: absent), BTEX 4 (benzene: 0.035mgL\u22121, toluene: 0.016mgL\u22121, ethylbenzene: absent, xylene: absent), BTEX 5 (all absent). The negative control was performed with ultra pure water and the positive control with methyl methanesulfonate \u2013 MMS (CAS No. 66-27-3), in a concentration of 4\u00d710\u22124 M. Culture medium of the bacteria used in the samples\u2019 degradation was used as a blank.Test-organism Seeds of A. cepa (2n =16 chromosomes) of a same stock and variety were used to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic BTEX effects of the five tested samples.Chromosome aberration and micronucleus tests The seeds of A. cepa were germinated in glass jars (500mL), with Teflon membrane caps, to prevent the compounds to volatilize into the atmosphere, assuring that the BTEX samples would remain the same during the entire experimental period. The assays were performed by adding 60mL of each non-biodegraded and biodegraded BTEX sample, MMS (positive control), ultra-pure water (negative control) and blank solution (biodegradation control) in separated jars. All assays were carried out in duplicate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is one of the components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) that undergoes a biodegradation process by bacteria sourced from a petroleum refinery's raw effluent. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this biodegradation process on reducing the concentration of ethylbenzene and other BTEX compounds, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene and the biodegradation process being assessed.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylbenzene and the biodegradation process, as the study provides quantitative data on the concentration changes of ethylbenzene before and after the process, demonstrating its relevance in the context of environmental bioremediation.",
