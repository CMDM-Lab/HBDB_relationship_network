    "context": "No peaks corresponding to the studied substances were detected in the blanks. In contrast to the hydrogen sulfide and organic sulfur gas flux samplings of 20 min duration each, the sampling time for SO2 was more than an hour in order to improve detection. SO2 samples were analyzed right after the sampling while other samples were kept in a freezer after the extraction according to the NIOSH methods referred above. Gas chromatographic determinations with FPD-S and ion chromatographic analyses were carried out at the Stuttgart University, Germany. GC-chemilumiscence analyses were carried out by means of a Hewlett Packard instrument at the petroleum refinery in Izmir, Turkey. Measurement results of the source emission concentrations and ambient air are presented in Table 1 . During the first series of tests in June, Meles\u2013Arap joint segment was highly polluted with organic sulfur compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned in relation to the analysis of organic sulfur compounds in air samples, while adjudication is not directly referenced or connected to any specific process or outcome related to the chemical analysis. The context primarily focuses on the sampling and measurement of sulfur compounds without discussing any adjudicative processes or decisions regarding the data collected.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
