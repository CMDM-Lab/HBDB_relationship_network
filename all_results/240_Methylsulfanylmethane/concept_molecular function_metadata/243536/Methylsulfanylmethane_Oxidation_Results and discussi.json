    "context": "Urban monitoring instruments located at other places in the city recorded values significantly lower than 50 \u03bcgm\u22123 SO2 during this study. Selected sampling sites in this study is not particularly close to any specific SO2 source. Further investigations are required to identify atmospheric oxidation pathways of reduced sulfur gases among photochemical reactions. The OH radical initiated oxidation of dimethylsulfide in synthetic air containing hydrogen peroxide and NO x compounds in irradiated chambers have been investigated by studying the production yields of oxygen containing sulfur compounds (Arsene et al., 2001). The concentration-time data derived in the above-mentioned study indicated that high molar yields of SO2 varying between 20% and 45% of sulfur introduced into the chamber was obtained within the first 200\u2013400 s of irradiation depending on changing air temperatures and NO x concentrations. It was proposed earlier that Izmir has a strong potential for photochemical smog (Hartmann et al., 1997) due to several factors including presence of appreciable levels of VOCs in the urban air (Muezzinoglu et al., 2001). Knowing the time scales of notable reaction yields reported by Arsene et al. (2001) and taking into account the low wind speeds, strong solar irradiation and high air temperatures during the samplings around the noon hours, it is possible that a statistical relationship can be derived between concentrations of total reduced-S and SO2\u2013S.

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to oxidation through its role as a reduced sulfur gas that undergoes photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. The study discusses the oxidation of dimethylsulfide, a compound related to methylsulfanylmethane, highlighting the production of sulfur compounds like SO2 during oxidation processes initiated by OH radicals. This suggests that methylsulfanylmethane may also participate in similar oxidation pathways, although it is not explicitly mentioned.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as methylsulfanylmethane is connected to oxidation through its association with dimethylsulfide and the broader context of atmospheric oxidation processes. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, limiting the strength of the connection.",
