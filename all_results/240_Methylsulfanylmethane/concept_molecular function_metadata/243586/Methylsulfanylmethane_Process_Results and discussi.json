    "context": "Fig. 3 shows that the lower the space velocity is, the higher the conversion of (CH3)2S is. The effect of O2 concentration on the conversion of (CH3)2S at a temperature of 270\u00b0C is shown in Fig. 4 . We find that the conversion of (CH3)2S increases as O2 concentration increases. This is consistent with the results of Ross and Sood and Chu and Horng, in which the results showed that the adsorption of the O2 molecule is important in the process of catalytic incineration of CH3SH and (CH3)2S as described by the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model for the catalytic incineration of CH3SH and (CH3)2S. Chu and Wu also showed that the O2 concentration had a positive effect on the conversion of ethyl mercaptan. Fig. 5 shows that the conversion of (CH3)2S reaches 97% around 230\u00b0C, but the CO2 yield only reaches about 20% at the same temperature. This suggests that the (CH3)2S intermediates of the reaction are the major components of the oxidized gas at lower temperatures. ",
