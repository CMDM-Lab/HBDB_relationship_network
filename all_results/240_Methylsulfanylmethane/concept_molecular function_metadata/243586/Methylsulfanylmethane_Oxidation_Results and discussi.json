    "context": "Chu and Wu also showed that the O2 concentration had a positive effect on the conversion of ethyl mercaptan. Fig. 5 shows that the conversion of (CH3)2S reaches 97% around 230\u00b0C, but the CO2 yield only reaches about 20% at the same temperature. This suggests that the (CH3)2S intermediates of the reaction are the major components of the oxidized gas at lower temperatures. Essentially complete oxidation of (CH3)2S to CO2 is not reached until the operating temperature is more than 380\u00b0C. At 380\u00b0C, the CO2 yield is 96%. The yield of SO2, another complete oxidation product, shows a wave pattern within the temperature range tested in this study. The peak of SO2 yield of this study, with a value of 60%, happened around 350\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane ((CH3)2S) is discussed in relation to its oxidation process. The study indicates that the conversion of (CH3)2S to CO2 and SO2 occurs at elevated temperatures, with significant oxidation observed at 230\u00b0C and near-complete oxidation at 380\u00b0C. This highlights the relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and oxidation, as the compound undergoes transformation into oxidized products under specific thermal conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between methylsulfanylmethane and oxidation, supported by quantitative data on conversion yields at varying temperatures. The context clearly illustrates the oxidation process of (CH3)2S, indicating its relevance in the study of oxidation reactions.",
