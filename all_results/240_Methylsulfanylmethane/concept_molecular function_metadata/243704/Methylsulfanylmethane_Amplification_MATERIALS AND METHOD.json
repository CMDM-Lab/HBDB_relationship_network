    "context": " [4] Proteinase K (50 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) was added, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00c2\u00b0C.  [5] The solution was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1).  [6] The pellet obtained after ethanol precipitation of the water phase was dissolved in 10 \u00ce\u00bcl of sterile distilled water and stored at \u00e2\u02c6\u201920\u00c2\u00b0C.  [7] The DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of an approximately 1,530-bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene with 2.5 mM MgCl2, an annealing temperature of 50\u00c2\u00b0C, and 35 cycles.  [8] The PCR amplification primers used were pA (19EubFOR) (5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-GAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2) and pH\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 (1522REV) (5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2) .  [9] The amplification product was ligated in the pCR II vector and transformed into Escherichia coli cells from the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). [10] Plasmid DNA of clones was isolated by using the FlexiPrep kit (Pharmacia P-L Biochemicals Inc.). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly related to the process of amplification described, which focuses on PCR amplification of DNA segments. The mention of amplification pertains to the use of specific primers and conditions for amplifying the 16S rRNA gene, with no indication that Methylsulfanylmethane plays a role in this process. Therefore, their relationship is coincidental and lacks direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that Methylsulfanylmethane and amplification are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion or evidence of a relationship between them. They appear independently without any functional or chemical connection.",
