    "context": "[1] Microscopy and photography.Transmission and scanning electron micrographs were made with a transmission electron microscope (Philips 201) and a Cryo-FEG scanning electron microscope (Jeol JSM 633OF) from cells of a late-exponential-phase culture. [2] Negative staining was done with uranyl acetate (0.5 to 1%).  [1] Phylogenetic analysis.DNA from the pure culture was isolated by harvesting the cells in an Eppendorf centrifuge (10,000 \u00c3\u2014 g for 5 min at room temperature).  [2] The cell pellet was washed two times in fresh nonreduced medium, suspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 M sodium EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02% lysozyme), and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00c2\u00b0C.  [3] Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (1% wt/vol) was added, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 37\u00c2\u00b0C.  [4] Proteinase K (50 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) was added, and the suspension was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00c2\u00b0C.  [5] The solution was extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly mentioned in relation to cytolysis. The focus is on the methodology for isolating DNA from cells, which involves cell lysis using a lysis buffer and subsequent treatments. While cytolysis refers to the breakdown of cells, there is no specific discussion of how Methylsulfanylmethane influences or relates to this process within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and cytolysis, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any functional or chemical connection.",
