    "context": "It is well known that after wounding, the aerial parts of plants emit C6 wound compounds (hexenal, hexanal and related compounds, Hatanaka, 1993). Infested B. nigra roots did not emit these compounds (results not shown). This is in agreement with Steeghs et al. (2004), who did not observe induction of C6 wound compounds in Arabidopsis root cultures that were mechanically damaged or infested with root-feeding insects. In contrast to Steeghs et al. (2004), however, we did not observe increased 1,8-cineole levels (m/z 155, detected at its main fragment m/z 81 with PTR-MS) in our system, neither using PTR-MS nor using GC\u2013MS.GC\u2013MS analysis and identification of the sulfides GC\u2013MS analysis of the volatiles released during infestation confirmed the induction of dimethyl sulfide (DMS; m/z 63 in the PTR-MS analysis) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS; m/z 95 in the PTR-MS) in the root headspace of infested plants (Fig. 3 ). Additionally, GC\u2013MS measurements showed increased levels of dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) in root infested plants (Fig. 3). The temporal dynamics of DMTS could not be observed with our PTR-MS due to its lack of sensitivity at higher masses and the low emission rate of this compound by the root system. Because of its low molecular weight and high volatility, the compound represented by m/z 49 could not be detected under the specific conditions of the GC\u2013MS system that was used. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is indirectly related to volatile substances as it is part of the analysis of volatile compounds released during plant infestation. The study highlights the emission of various sulfides, including dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which are volatile substances. However, MSM itself is not specifically mentioned as being emitted or analyzed, indicating a more general connection to the category of volatile substances rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Methylsulfanylmethane is associated with the broader category of volatile substances through the discussion of emitted sulfides, but there is no direct evidence or detailed relationship established in the context.",
