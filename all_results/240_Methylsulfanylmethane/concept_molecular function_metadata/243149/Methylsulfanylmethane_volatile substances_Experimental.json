    "context": "Experimentally, higher m/z 60 levels could be observed at higher levels of the contaminant primary ions NO+ and O2 +. The system was calibrated by mixing a variable flow of air free of hydrocarbons (by passing it through a catalytic converter at 350\u00b0C), with a fixed flow of 0.3L/h of a gas mixture of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene, benzene, toluene and xylene (molecular weights ranging from 32amu to 106amu) in concentrations of 1ppmv (\u00b15%) (Linde, Dieren, The Netherlands). In this way, calibration factors are obtained for these compounds converting ion intensity (in ncps, normalized counts per seconds) to gas mixing ratios (in ppbv, part per billion volume). From these conversion factors the calibration factors of other compounds at a specific m/z ratio were calculated, taking into account the difference in collision rate constant in the drift tube and transmission efficiency factors of the mass spectrometer (de Gouw and Warneke, 2007).Gas handling set-up To maximize the collection of root volatiles, cuvettes such as the one shown in Fig. 9 A were employed. Silicon tubing was used to connect the glass inlet and the Teflon tube into the PTR-MS. Care was taken to minimize the contact (<1mm) of the VOC flow with the silicon because silicon adsorbs VOCs. In Fig. 9B a typical set-up with the root cuvette is shown; the plants were grown with a pot somewhat larger than the diameter of the cuvette to maximize VOC influx, and a synthetic rubber based sealant (Terostat IX) is used between the two halves of the cuvette to avoid major leaks.

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned alongside various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as part of a calibration process for measuring gas mixing ratios in a mass spectrometer. While Methylsulfanylmethane is a type of volatile substance, the context does not provide specific interactions or detailed relationships between it and other volatile substances. Instead, it focuses on the methodology for analyzing these compounds collectively.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Methylsulfanylmethane is categorized as a volatile substance, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or interactions with other volatile substances in the context provided.",
