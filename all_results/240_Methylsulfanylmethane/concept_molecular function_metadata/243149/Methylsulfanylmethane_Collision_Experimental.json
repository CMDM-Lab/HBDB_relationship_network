    "context": "Experimentally, higher m/z 60 levels could be observed at higher levels of the contaminant primary ions NO+ and O2 +. The system was calibrated by mixing a variable flow of air free of hydrocarbons (by passing it through a catalytic converter at 350\u00b0C), with a fixed flow of 0.3L/h of a gas mixture of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, isoprene, benzene, toluene and xylene (molecular weights ranging from 32amu to 106amu) in concentrations of 1ppmv (\u00b15%) (Linde, Dieren, The Netherlands). In this way, calibration factors are obtained for these compounds converting ion intensity (in ncps, normalized counts per seconds) to gas mixing ratios (in ppbv, part per billion volume). From these conversion factors the calibration factors of other compounds at a specific m/z ratio were calculated, taking into account the difference in collision rate constant in the drift tube and transmission efficiency factors of the mass spectrometer (de Gouw and Warneke, 2007).Gas handling set-up To maximize the collection of root volatiles, cuvettes such as the one shown in Fig. 9 A were employed. Silicon tubing was used to connect the glass inlet and the Teflon tube into the PTR-MS. Care was taken to minimize the contact (<1mm) of the VOC flow with the silicon because silicon adsorbs VOCs. In Fig. 9B a typical set-up with the root cuvette is shown; the plants were grown with a pot somewhat larger than the diameter of the cuvette to maximize VOC influx, and a synthetic rubber based sealant (Terostat IX) is used between the two halves of the cuvette to avoid major leaks.

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned as part of a gas mixture used for calibration in a mass spectrometry experiment. The term 'collision' refers to the collision rate constant in the drift tube of the mass spectrometer, which is relevant for determining the transmission efficiency of various compounds, including Methylsulfanylmethane. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship established between Methylsulfanylmethane and collision beyond their roles in the calibration process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the calibration of the mass spectrometer, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
