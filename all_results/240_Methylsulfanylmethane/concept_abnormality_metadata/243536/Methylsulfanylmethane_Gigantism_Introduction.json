    "context": "Odor complaint is an old reality in Izmir and goes back to the time of Strabon (63\u201323 BC), the Greek author, geographer and historian who visited the city and mentioned the foul odors. He connected them to the lack of urban engineering infrastructure in the city (Turkish Republic Ministry of Culture, 1993). Izmir municipality is applying a series of projects that resulted in the disappearance of the foul odors caused by the lack of infrastructure for millennia. Recently, the installation of a giant collection and treatment plant system to serve the city and its 2.7 million population is completed. This project aims at treating 7 m3 s\u22121 wastewater at 2010 and more than 4.5 m3 s\u22121 of this was already connected to the treatment plant when the sampling program was carried out. Uslu et al. (1988) reported the odor predictions for an earlier version of the Izmir sewerage and wastewater treatment plant. As the treatment plant technology of this old project was revised in 1997, the H2S emissions and resulting odor levels due to the presently applied wastewater treatment project were predicted again within the scope of an environmental impact assessment report (Muezzinoglu and Elbir, 1998).

        "summary": "In this context, there is no direct relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and gigantism. The text discusses urban infrastructure and wastewater treatment in Izmir, with no mention of methylsulfanylmethane's biological effects or any connection to gigantism. Both terms appear independently without any relevant interaction or significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects the absence of any relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and gigantism in the provided context. They are mentioned separately without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
