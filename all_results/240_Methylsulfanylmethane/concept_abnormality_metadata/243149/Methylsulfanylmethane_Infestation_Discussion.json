    "context": "Therefore, it is likely that the majority of the sulfide signals originate from the roots themselves and not from the insect or associated microorganisms. This study shows that root damage, either by root feeding insects or by artificial damage, induces various time-resolved volatile responses in plant roots. When considering these temporal dynamics, the emissions seem to be divided into early and late responses. HCNS, represented by m/z 60, showed an immediate response both after infestation and artificial damage. The results presented here show that HCNS likely arises from the two component glucosinolate\u2013myrosinase system that is constitutively present in the plant, and is activated by artificial as well as herbivore damage to the plant (Rask et al., 2000). Allyl ITC was found to be the most likely candidate for being the parent compound of HCNS. The precursor glucosinolate of allyl ITC, allylglucosinolate (sinigrin), is one of the major glucosinolates in B. nigra roots, constituting about 40\u201350% of the glucosinolate profile in the main roots (van Dam and Raaijmakers, 2006).

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to infestation through the study of volatile responses in plant roots following damage from root-feeding insects. The research highlights how root damage triggers the release of certain volatile compounds, including those derived from glucosinolates, which may be involved in plant defense mechanisms against infestations. However, Methylsulfanylmethane itself is not specifically mentioned as a direct response to infestation, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Methylsulfanylmethane and infestation, as both are involved in the broader context of plant responses to root damage. However, there is no detailed discussion of their direct interaction or specific relevance.",
