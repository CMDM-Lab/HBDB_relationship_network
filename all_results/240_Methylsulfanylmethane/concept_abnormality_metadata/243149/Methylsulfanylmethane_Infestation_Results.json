    "context": "Renewed damage, however, initiated the reaction again resulting in increased m/z 60 emissions (Fig. 6). From this figure it can also be seen that artificial damage has no direct effect on DMS (m/z 63) and DMDS (m/z 95) signals; methanethiol (m/z 49) showed increased emissions after artificial damage, though much smaller than the one observed for m/z 60. The rapid increase of m/z 60 supports our hypothesis that the fast m/z 60 emissions result from the rapid conversion of glucosinolates by the enzyme myrosinase and possibly other enzymes involved in glucosinolate conversion (Wittstock et al., 2003).Influence of larval instar on the temporal profile In addition, the influence of the larval developmental stage, or instar, on the temporal emission profile or intensity of the emissions was studied. For this, m/z 60 (HCNS) was chosen as a marker, because of its high reproducibility, and the quick and strong signal that was measured directly after infestation. Fig. 7 shows m/z 60 emissions of roots infested with four small first instar larvae, four large late second instar larvae, and control roots. At the end of the experiments, actively feeding larvae were found in all replicates infested with first instar larvae, on average two in each root. In the experiments with the larger larvae, all larvae had pupated by the end of the experiment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is indirectly related to infestation through the study of emissions from roots infested with larvae. The rapid increase in m/z 60 emissions, which is associated with glucosinolate conversion, suggests that infestation by larvae influences the biochemical processes in the roots, potentially affecting the production of DMS. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and DMS is not directly linked to the infestation process itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Methylsulfanylmethane and infestation, as both are mentioned in the context of root emissions during larval feeding, but their relationship lacks detailed exploration or direct interaction.",
