[1] The concentrations of the volatile organic sulfur compounds methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and the viable population capable of DMS utilization in laminated microbial ecosystems were evaluated. [2] Significant levels of DMS and dimethyl disulfide (maximum concentrations of 220 and 24 nmol cm3 of sediment-1, respectively) could be detected only at the top 20 mm of the microbial mat, whereas methanethiol was found only at depth horizons from 20 to 50 mm (maximum concentration of 42 nmol cm3 of sediment-1). [3] DMS concentrations in the surface layer doubled after cold hydrolysis of its precursor, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. [4] Most-probable-number counts revealed 2.2 x 10(5) cells cm3 of sediment-1, in the 0- to 5-mm depth horizon, capable of growth on DMS as the sole source of energy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to organic sulfur compounds as it is part of a broader discussion on volatile organic sulfur compounds, including methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl sulfide (DMS). While methylsulfanylmethane is not explicitly mentioned, it falls under the category of organic sulfur compounds, which are being evaluated for their concentrations and ecological roles in microbial ecosystems. However, the specific relationship or significance of methylsulfanylmethane is not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as methylsulfanylmethane is categorized under organic sulfur compounds, but there is no direct discussion or evidence of its specific role or interaction within the context provided.",
