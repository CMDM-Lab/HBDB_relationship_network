[1] The concentrations of the volatile organic sulfur compounds methanethiol, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and the viable population capable of DMS utilization in laminated microbial ecosystems were evaluated. [2] Significant levels of DMS and dimethyl disulfide (maximum concentrations of 220 and 24 nmol cm3 of sediment-1, respectively) could be detected only at the top 20 mm of the microbial mat, whereas methanethiol was found only at depth horizons from 20 to 50 mm (maximum concentration of 42 nmol cm3 of sediment-1). [3] DMS concentrations in the surface layer doubled after cold hydrolysis of its precursor, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. [4] Most-probable-number counts revealed 2.2 x 10(5) cells cm3 of sediment-1, in the 0- to 5-mm depth horizon, capable of growth on DMS as the sole source of energy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as both are volatile organic sulfur compounds involved in microbial ecosystems. The study evaluates the concentrations of DMS and its precursors, indicating that DMS can be produced from the hydrolysis of methylsulfanylmethane's precursor, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. However, the specific relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and DMS is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide, as they are both part of the sulfur compound ecosystem, but their specific interactions or functional relationships are not elaborated upon in the context.",
