    "context": "with R 2 =0.988. Therefore, HCNS itself, or a bigger molecule fragmenting into HCNS, is a likely candidate for this mass m/z 60. To further investigate the origin of m/z 60, the fragmentation patterns of a number of volatile glucosinolate breakdown products were studied. Based on GC\u2013MS analysis, B. nigra root glucosinolate and VOC profiles reported in the literature, the following thiocyanates (TC) and isothiocyanates (ITC) were considered as candidates for the parent mass: methyl TC, methyl ITC, ethyl TC, ethyl ITC, allyl ITC and 2-phenethyl ITC. Pure samples of the above mentioned compounds were measured with PTR-MS in order to obtain their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns. For this, closed vials (5mL volume) containing the pure compound were used, with a syringe needle penetrating the septum in the cap. These emitters were placed in a 1L volume cuvette and flushed with air. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and methyl thiocyanate are discussed as potential breakdown products of glucosinolates, specifically in relation to their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns. The study investigates various thiocyanates and isothiocyanates, including methyl thiocyanate, as candidates for the parent mass observed in the analysis. While both compounds are part of the same analytical framework, their direct relationship is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from glucosinolate breakdown.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both methylsulfanylmethane and methyl thiocyanate are analyzed in the context of glucosinolate breakdown products, indicating some level of interaction in the study. However, the specifics of their relationship are not deeply explored.",
