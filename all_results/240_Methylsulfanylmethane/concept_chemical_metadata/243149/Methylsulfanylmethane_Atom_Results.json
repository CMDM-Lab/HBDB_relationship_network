    "context": "(three replicate average, R 2 =0.81). This ratio is close to the most abundant atomic sulfur ratio 34S/32S=4.41% (NIST). The only candidate for m/z 49 that includes a sulfur atom has as molecular formula CH3SH, with an abundance of: m/z 51/m/z 49=4.44%. This value is in very good agreement with the experimental value, confirming the assignment of m/z 49 to methanethiol, a compound that has been previously reported in Brassicaceae (Bending and Lincoln, 1999; Attieh et al., 2000).Glucosinolate breakdown products and identification of m/z 60 Furthermore, the GC\u2013MS analyses identified the presence of allyl isothiocyanate, phenylethyl isothiocyanate and benzonitrile (Fig. 4 ), which are volatile glucosinolate breakdown products and possibly also the origin of the compound detected at m/z 60 with PTR-MS. As mentioned above, the major glucosinolate breakdown products are divided into nitriles, thiocyanates and isothiocyanates (see Fig. 1). The compounds in the last two groups contain a CNS group. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (CH3SH) is identified as a sulfur-containing compound, specifically a thiol, which includes sulfur atoms in its molecular structure. The discussion revolves around the atomic sulfur ratio and the identification of sulfur-containing compounds in Brassicaceae. However, the relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and the term 'Atom' is primarily structural, with no detailed interaction or functional relevance provided in the context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Methylsulfanylmethane is a compound that contains sulfur atoms, but the context does not elaborate on any significant interaction or functional relationship between them beyond their structural association.",
