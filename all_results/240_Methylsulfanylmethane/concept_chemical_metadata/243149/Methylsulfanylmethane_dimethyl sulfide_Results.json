    "context": "It is well known that after wounding, the aerial parts of plants emit C6 wound compounds (hexenal, hexanal and related compounds, Hatanaka, 1993). Infested B. nigra roots did not emit these compounds (results not shown). This is in agreement with Steeghs et al. (2004), who did not observe induction of C6 wound compounds in Arabidopsis root cultures that were mechanically damaged or infested with root-feeding insects. In contrast to Steeghs et al. (2004), however, we did not observe increased 1,8-cineole levels (m/z 155, detected at its main fragment m/z 81 with PTR-MS) in our system, neither using PTR-MS nor using GC\u2013MS.GC\u2013MS analysis and identification of the sulfides GC\u2013MS analysis of the volatiles released during infestation confirmed the induction of dimethyl sulfide (DMS; m/z 63 in the PTR-MS analysis) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS; m/z 95 in the PTR-MS) in the root headspace of infested plants (Fig. 3 ). Additionally, GC\u2013MS measurements showed increased levels of dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS) in root infested plants (Fig. 3). The temporal dynamics of DMTS could not be observed with our PTR-MS due to its lack of sensitivity at higher masses and the low emission rate of this compound by the root system. Because of its low molecular weight and high volatility, the compound represented by m/z 49 could not be detected under the specific conditions of the GC\u2013MS system that was used. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are related through their roles as volatile organic compounds emitted by plants, particularly in response to infestation. The study confirms the induction of DMS in the root headspace of infested plants, indicating a potential biochemical pathway involving methylsulfanylmethane as a precursor or related compound in the emission of DMS during plant stress responses. However, the specific relationship between the two compounds is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in the context of plant emissions during stress, with DMS being confirmed as emitted. However, the direct relationship or interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and DMS is not explicitly detailed.",
