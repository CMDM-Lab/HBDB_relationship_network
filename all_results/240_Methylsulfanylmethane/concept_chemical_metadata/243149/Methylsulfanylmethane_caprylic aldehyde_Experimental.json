    "context": "Volatiles were desorbed from the traps into the GC\u2013MS (model Trace, ThermoFinnigan, Austin, TX, USA) using an automated thermodesorption unit (model Unity, Markes International Ltd., Llantrisant, UK) as described in van Dam et al. (2010). Compounds were identified by their mass spectra using deconvolution software (AMDIS) in combination with NIST 2005 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA, http://www.nist.gov) and Wiley seventh edition spectral libraries. Additionally, reference spectra was obtained from several plant volatile compounds (farnesene, +-limonene, methyljasmonate, methylsalicilate, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, octanal, nonanal, decanal, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, 2-phenylethylalcohol, indole, benzylcyanide and phenylisothiocyanate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, IL, USA); as well as methyl thiocyanate, methyl isothiocyanate, ethyl thiocyanate, ethyl isothiocyanate and allyl isothiocyanate (Acros Organics BVBA, Geel, Belgium). For identification, linear retention indices (lri) were used, and the lri data for the compounds in the study were confirmed by authentic standards. The integrated signals generated by the AMDIS software from the MS-chromatograms were used for comparison between the treatments. Peak areas in each sample were divided by the total air volume (in ml) that was sampled over the trap to correct for differences sampling times between experiments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and caprylic aldehyde are both mentioned as volatile compounds identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interaction, or significance in the study. They are part of a broader list of plant volatile compounds analyzed, but no specific connection between them is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as methylsulfanylmethane and caprylic aldehyde are simply listed among other volatile compounds without any indication of interaction or relevance to each other in the context provided.",
        "score": 1
