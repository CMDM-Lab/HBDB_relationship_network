    "context": "Volatiles were desorbed from the traps into the GC\u2013MS (model Trace, ThermoFinnigan, Austin, TX, USA) using an automated thermodesorption unit (model Unity, Markes International Ltd., Llantrisant, UK) as described in van Dam et al. (2010). Compounds were identified by their mass spectra using deconvolution software (AMDIS) in combination with NIST 2005 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA, http://www.nist.gov) and Wiley seventh edition spectral libraries. Additionally, reference spectra was obtained from several plant volatile compounds (farnesene, +-limonene, methyljasmonate, methylsalicilate, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, octanal, nonanal, decanal, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, 2-phenylethylalcohol, indole, benzylcyanide and phenylisothiocyanate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, IL, USA); as well as methyl thiocyanate, methyl isothiocyanate, ethyl thiocyanate, ethyl isothiocyanate and allyl isothiocyanate (Acros Organics BVBA, Geel, Belgium). For identification, linear retention indices (lri) were used, and the lri data for the compounds in the study were confirmed by authentic standards. The integrated signals generated by the AMDIS software from the MS-chromatograms were used for comparison between the treatments. Peak areas in each sample were divided by the total air volume (in ml) that was sampled over the trap to correct for differences sampling times between experiments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as volatile compounds identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. They are part of a broader study on plant volatiles, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. Their mention is primarily in the context of identification and analysis rather than any functional or chemical relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are listed among plant volatiles analyzed in the study, indicating they belong to the same category of substances. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other.",
        "score": 2
