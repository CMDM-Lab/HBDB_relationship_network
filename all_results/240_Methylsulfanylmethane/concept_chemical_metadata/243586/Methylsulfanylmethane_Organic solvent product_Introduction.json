    "context": "However, the sulfur-poisoning effects of both the VOCs were not significant once the operating temperatures exceeded 350\u00b0C. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are defined as the organic compounds that have high vapor pressure and are easily vaporized at the condition of ambient temperature and pressure. Many hydrocarbons, including nitrogenous, chlorinated, and sulfurated organics are determined to be VOCs. These compounds are usually found in the industries that manufacture or utilize organic solvents, e.g. petrochemical, pulp, or coating industry. Besides causing harmful effects on human organs, many VOCs may also react with NO x in the atmosphere to form photochemical smog and O3  . Some VOCs such as mercaptans, dimethyl sulfides, or amines, are not extremely toxic but may present offensive odor even at extremely low concentration. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned as a type of volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be found in industries utilizing organic solvents. While it is categorized among VOCs, the specific relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and organic solvent products is not elaborated upon. The discussion focuses on the general characteristics and effects of VOCs, including their potential toxicity and environmental impact, rather than detailing how Methylsulfanylmethane functions as an organic solvent product.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Methylsulfanylmethane is classified as a VOC relevant to organic solvent products, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or interactions within that category.",
