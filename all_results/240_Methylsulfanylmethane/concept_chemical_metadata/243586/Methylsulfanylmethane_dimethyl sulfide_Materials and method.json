    "context": "The second part was a life test of the catalyst by catalytic incineration of (CH3)2S to identify the sulfur poisoning effect. The last part was conducted to catalytically incinerate a mixture of (CH3)2S with CH3SH. The results could be compared with the first part of the experiments to determine the interference of (CH3)2S conversion by adding CH3SH. Reagent grade liquid dimethyl sulfide was injected into the VOC generator, which was kept at a constant temperature of \u22125\u00b0C in the water bath. Purged N2 carried the vaporized VOC to mix with dilution air and N2 in the mixture to simulate the waste gas from a typical petrochemical plant, at a certain flow rate and O2 concentration. The simulated gas was injected into the catalytic reactor heated by an electrical furnace. Gas samples (1ml) were taken before and after the reaction, by an on-line autosampler, to be injected into the GC to determine the conversion of the VOC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both sulfur-containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in a catalytic incineration experiment. The study focuses on the catalytic conversion of dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) and its interaction with methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) to assess the effects of sulfur poisoning on the catalyst. Their relationship is significant as they are both part of the same experimental setup aimed at understanding VOC conversion processes in petrochemical waste gas treatment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide, as both are involved in the same catalytic incineration experiments, indicating a clear functional relationship in the context of VOC treatment. The study aims to analyze their interactions and effects on catalyst performance.",
