    "context": "All mass flow meters and rotameters used in this study were calibrated by a bubble meter (Humonic digitial flow meter 650) or a dry gas meter (Shinagawa DK-SCF-T) at their proper ranges. Standard gases included zero gas (N2, 99.995%, San Fu), SO2 span gas (435ppm, SanFu), O2 span gas (19%, San Fu), CO span gas (502ppm, San Fu), CO2 span gas (1970ppm, San Fu), CH3SH span gas (200ppm, U S Gas) and (CH3)2S span gas (200ppm, U S Gas). The catalyst samples were taken before and after the reaction to determine the changes of their specific surface area, because of sulfur poisoning, by a BET specific surface area analyzer (FlowSorb II 2300), to determine the Changes of their sulfur content by an ESCA analyzer (VG ESCA 210) and to determine the changes of their crystalloid by a XRD analyzer (Rigaku D/MAX III). Liquid (CH3)2S was a product of Merck Chemical Inc. (purity >99%). The catalyst was a commercial product of NIKKI NS-10 Pt/Al2O3. Its basic properties are shown in Table 1 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (specifically dimethyl sulfide, (CH3)2S) is mentioned as a standard gas used in calibration for various gas measurements. It is categorized as a chemical, specifically a volatile organic compound, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or relevance beyond its role as a standard gas in the study. Thus, while it is a chemical, the relationship is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Methylsulfanylmethane is identified as a chemical used in the study, but there is no significant discussion of its properties, interactions, or implications within the context provided.",
