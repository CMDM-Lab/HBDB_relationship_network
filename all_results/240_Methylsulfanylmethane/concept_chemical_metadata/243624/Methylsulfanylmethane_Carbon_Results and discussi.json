(8) C H 3 \u2212 S \u2212 C H 3 + 5 O 2 = S O 4 2 \u2212 + 2 H + + 2 H 2 O + 2 C O 2 \u2191 An initial DMS injection amounts from 14.53\u03bcmol to 80.81\u03bcmol eventually converts 24.43\u03bcmol or 134.49\u03bcmol CO2. Furthermore, Dry weight (DW) production ranged from 0.41mg to 2.36mg, revealing that more than 81% of the carbon source was eventually converted to CO2, and at least 6.33% of the carbon source was utilized by the cells to increase biomass. Consequently, there was no organic carbon present as intermediates, and in the control tests, DMS loss during this process was less than 3%. The degradation characteristics and bacterial growth of Alcaligenes sp. SY1 using DMS as the sole carbon source were investigated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is utilized as a carbon source by Alcaligenes sp. SY1, leading to the conversion of DMS into carbon dioxide (CO2) during the degradation process. The stoichiometric relationship indicates that for every mole of DMS, two moles of CO2 are produced, highlighting a direct metabolic pathway where DMS serves as a carbon source for bacterial growth and CO2 generation. The study emphasizes the efficiency of DMS in carbon utilization, with a significant portion of the carbon being converted to CO2 and biomass.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between methylsulfanylmethane and carbon, as the context provides quantitative data on the conversion of DMS to CO2, demonstrating a clear metabolic relationship and the role of DMS as a carbon source in bacterial growth.",
