    "context": "Chu et al. used a MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst to study the kinetics of catalytic incineration of (CH3)2S and (CH3)2S2. They found that the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model was suitable to describe the conversion of both the VOCs. This result may be related to the sulfur-poisoning effect on the catalyst. This study involved the catalytic incineration of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide over MnO/Fe2O3 in a fixed bed reactor. The operating parameters included inlet temperature, space velocity, VOCs concentration and O2 concentration. A life-test of the catalyst on both the VOCs was also performed to identify the sulfur-poisoning effect. The catalytic incineration in this study was performed using a bench-scale, fixed-bed reaction system. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) studied for their catalytic incineration over a MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst. The research focuses on the kinetics of converting these compounds, indicating a direct relationship in their behavior during catalytic processes. The study highlights the sulfur-poisoning effect on the catalyst, which is relevant to both compounds, suggesting they may share similar degradation pathways in catalytic reactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide, as both are analyzed in the same catalytic incineration study, demonstrating their interaction and shared relevance in the context of VOC degradation and catalyst performance.",
        "score": 4
