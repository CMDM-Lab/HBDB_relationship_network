    "context": "This result is consistent with the results of Chu et al., who showed that (CH3)2S, (CH3)2S2 and C2H5SH had a poisoning effect on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and the MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst at lower temperatures. Fig. 6(b) shows the sulfur-poisoning effect of (CH3)2S2 on the MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst. The same trend as that for (CH3)2S is found. Fig. 7(a) shows the specific surface areas of the MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst for 25-h dimethyl sulfide poisoning at varied temperatures (200, 300, and 400\u00b0C) and Fig. 7(b) for 24-h dimethyl disulfide poisoning at varied temperatures (200, 300, and 350\u00b0C). The results show that the specific surface areas of the poisoned catalysts are less than that of the fresh catalyst. This finding also suggests that the catalyst surface may be covered by sulfur compounds after the reaction. The surface area differences between the fresh catalyst and the poisoned catalyst for the case of (CH3)2S are more dramatic than that of (CH3)2S2. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane ((CH3)2S) and dimethyl disulfide ((CH3)2S2) are both sulfur-containing compounds that exhibit a poisoning effect on catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 and MnO/Fe2O3 at lower temperatures. The study highlights their roles in catalyst deactivation, indicating that both compounds can negatively impact the specific surface area of the catalysts, suggesting a direct relationship in terms of their effects on catalytic performance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide, as both are shown to poison catalysts, supported by experimental data demonstrating their effects on catalyst surface area. This indicates a clear relationship in the context of catalyst performance.",
