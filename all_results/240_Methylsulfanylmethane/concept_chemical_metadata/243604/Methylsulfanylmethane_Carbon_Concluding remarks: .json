    "context": "Several models predict that diatoms will decline in future warmer and more acidic oceans, while pan-tropical coccolithophores may become the dominant organisms). Studies show different scenarios of DMS emission changes in response to changing temperature and oceanic pH (Box 3 ), but none have so far examined the potential biochemical and/or functional link between DMS emission and other important VOCs (especially isoprene) in phytoplankton. Cyanobacteria are an important source of marine isoprene in the tropical oceans of today, and there is wide consensus that cyanobacteria will become more prominent in warm oceans. While biochemical competitive constraints on DMSP and DMAPP syntheses remain speculative at this stage, if DMS-emitting species in the tropics migrate to higher latitudes in search of new favorable niches (e.g.,), and if species emitting isoprene, particularly cyanobacteria, become dominant following climate warming, then there will be significant consequences for global atmospheric sulfur and carbon budgets as well as for marine ecology. Author Contributions and Acknowledgements K.G.S.D. conceived and developed the hypothesis and wrote the manuscript with critical editorial inputs from F.L. The authors wish to thank three anonymous reviewers for their insightful questions and criticism that improved the manuscript, and to acknowledge discussions with Parvadha Suntharalingam (University of East Anglia) and Colin Prentice (Imperial College London). Outstanding Questions What are the structural and biochemical properties of isoprene syntheses in phytoplankton? Are the elusive marine isoprene synthases very different from their terrestrial counterparts? ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is discussed in relation to its emissions from marine phytoplankton, which are influenced by changing ocean temperatures and pH levels. The relationship to carbon arises as the study highlights the potential impact of DMS emissions on global carbon budgets, particularly as cyanobacteria, which produce isoprene, may become more dominant in warmer oceans. This suggests a significant interaction between DMS emissions and carbon cycling in marine ecosystems.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Methylsulfanylmethane and carbon, as the context discusses how changes in DMS emissions could affect global carbon budgets, indicating a clear relationship within marine ecology and biogeochemical cycles.",
        "score": 4
