    "context": "(Rodhe, 1999). Marine aquatic systems account for as much as 98% of the natural atmospheric VOSCs (Brasseur et al., 1999). This explains why tremendous efforts have been devoted to the study of oceanic VOSCs. In the ocean, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is the most important VOSC source, accounting for more than 90% of the biogenic sulfur emissions from oceans and approximately two thirds of the total biogenic sulfur inputs to the atmosphere (Rodhe, 1999). Other environmentally important VOSCs include methanthiol (MeSH), carbon disulfide (CS2), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). Marine phytoplankton play perhaps the most important role in worldwide production of VOSCs (Andreae, 1990). Bacteria, however, are also important in regulating the cycling of VOSCs through production and consumption of various VOSC species (Andreae, 1986; Kiene and Linn, 2000). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are both mentioned as volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) produced in marine environments. DMS is highlighted as the primary VOSC source, contributing significantly to biogenic sulfur emissions. While methylsulfanylmethane is not directly linked to DMS in terms of production or function, both are part of the broader discussion on VOSCs in oceanic systems, indicating a shared ecological relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide, as they are both categorized under VOSCs in marine systems. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
