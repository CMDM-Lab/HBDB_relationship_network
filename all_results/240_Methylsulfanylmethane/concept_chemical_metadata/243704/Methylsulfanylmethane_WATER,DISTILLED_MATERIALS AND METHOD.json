    "context": "[5] Sterilized sediment slurries (121\u00c2\u00b0C, 20 min) served as abiotic controls. [1] Media and culture techniques.The defined sulfide-reduced and bicarbonate-buffered medium described before  was supplemented with Na2SO4 to a final concentration of 28 mM. [2] Instead of sulfide, other compounds were used as reducing agents: sodium thiosulfate (0.5 mM), cysteine-HCl (2 mM), sodium dithionite (0.5 mM), and titanium(III) nitrilotriacetic acid [Ti(III)NTA] (0.1 mM). [3] Additions of carbon sources (syringate, TMB, gallate, pyrogallol, or pyroglucinol) (final concentration, 5 mM) were made 1 to 2 h before inoculation from anaerobic filter-sterilized stock solutions prepared in distilled water and neutralized with NaOH. [4] Enrichment cultures were done in an anaerobic chemostat fed with syringate as the sole carbon source, continuously gassed with an H2S-containing gas stream (N2-CO2 [80:20, vol/vol]) . [5] The chemostat was inoculated with 10% of a sediment slurry which had been pulsed with syringate. [6] Batch cultivation was carried out in either 60-, 120-, or 500-ml serum bottles filled with 25, 50, or 350 ml of medium, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly discussed in relation to distilled water. Instead, distilled water is mentioned as a medium for preparing anaerobic filter-sterilized stock solutions, which are then used in experiments involving various reducing agents and carbon sources. Methylsulfanylmethane does not appear to have a specific functional or chemical relationship with distilled water in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methylsulfanylmethane and distilled water are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or relevance to each other. They are simply part of the experimental setup without a defined connection.",
