    "context": "[4] The sediment slurries (duplicates or triplicates) were incubated in the dark without shaking at 30\u00c2\u00b0C. [5] Sterilized sediment slurries (121\u00c2\u00b0C, 20 min) served as abiotic controls. [1] Media and culture techniques.The defined sulfide-reduced and bicarbonate-buffered medium described before  was supplemented with Na2SO4 to a final concentration of 28 mM. [2] Instead of sulfide, other compounds were used as reducing agents: sodium thiosulfate (0.5 mM), cysteine-HCl (2 mM), sodium dithionite (0.5 mM), and titanium(III) nitrilotriacetic acid [Ti(III)NTA] (0.1 mM). [3] Additions of carbon sources (syringate, TMB, gallate, pyrogallol, or pyroglucinol) (final concentration, 5 mM) were made 1 to 2 h before inoculation from anaerobic filter-sterilized stock solutions prepared in distilled water and neutralized with NaOH. [4] Enrichment cultures were done in an anaerobic chemostat fed with syringate as the sole carbon source, continuously gassed with an H2S-containing gas stream (N2-CO2 [80:20, vol/vol]) . [5] The chemostat was inoculated with 10% of a sediment slurry which had been pulsed with syringate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and Sodium Dithionite are both mentioned as compounds used in the preparation of anaerobic cultures. Sodium Dithionite is specifically listed as a reducing agent in the defined medium, while Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly linked to any specific function or interaction with Sodium Dithionite. Their relationship is primarily based on their roles in the same experimental setup, without detailed discussion of their interactions or combined effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Methylsulfanylmethane and Sodium Dithionite are both part of the experimental context but are not directly related in terms of function or interaction. They share a general category as compounds used in the same study without further elaboration.",
        "score": 2
