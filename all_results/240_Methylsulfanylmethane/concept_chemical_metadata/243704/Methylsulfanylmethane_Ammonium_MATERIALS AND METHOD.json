    "context": "[1] Analytical techniques.Gas samples were analyzed for H2S, MT, DMS, and methane as described before . [2] Acetate, butyrate, and methanol were measured as described by Cazemier et al. . [3] Methoxylated and hydroxylated aromatic compounds were analyzed by isocratic separation on a high-pressure liquid chromatograph equipped with a Merck LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column and an HP1040 diode array detector. [4] The flow rate of the eluent, 40% (vol/vol) methanol in ammonium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 2.6), was 0.5 ml/min. [5] The column temperature was 25\u00c2\u00b0C. [1] Microscopy and photography.Transmission and scanning electron micrographs were made with a transmission electron microscope (Philips 201) and a Cryo-FEG scanning electron microscope (Jeol JSM 633OF) from cells of a late-exponential-phase culture. [2] Negative staining was done with uranyl acetate (0.5 to 1%). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and ammonium are both mentioned in relation to analytical techniques used for measuring various compounds. Ammonium phosphate buffer is utilized in the chromatography process, but there is no direct interaction or relationship established between methylsulfanylmethane and ammonium. They appear in the same analytical framework without any specific functional connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as methylsulfanylmethane and ammonium are mentioned in the context of analytical methods but lack any direct relevance or interaction in the study.",
