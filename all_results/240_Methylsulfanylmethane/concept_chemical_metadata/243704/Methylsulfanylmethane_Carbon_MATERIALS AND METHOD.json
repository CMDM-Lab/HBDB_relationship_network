    "context": "[2] Incubations were carried out under N2-CO2(80:20, vol/vol) at 35\u00c2\u00b0C. [3] Incubation was started by addition of syringate or syringate plus sodium sulfide. [1] Cell extract incubations.A 20-liter fermentor was inoculated with a pure culture. [2] After depletion of the carbon source, the culture received another pulse of syringate (5 mM). [3] After growth for 200 h at 30\u00c2\u00b0C, cells were harvested by continuous centrifugation (Sharples; 20,000 \u00c3\u2014 g, 17\u00c2\u00b0C) under an N2 atmosphere. [4] The cell pellet was resuspended in TES buffer {50 mM 2-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-1-ethanesulfonic acid (TES), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.0}. [5] Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell under an N2 atmosphere at 120 MPa. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly discussed in relation to carbon, but carbon is mentioned as part of the gas mixture (N2-CO2) used during the incubation process. The relationship appears to be incidental, as carbon serves as a component of the atmosphere in which the biological processes occur, rather than indicating a specific interaction or functional relationship with Methylsulfanylmethane.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methylsulfanylmethane and carbon are mentioned in the context, but there is no direct discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other beyond carbon's role in the incubation atmosphere.",
