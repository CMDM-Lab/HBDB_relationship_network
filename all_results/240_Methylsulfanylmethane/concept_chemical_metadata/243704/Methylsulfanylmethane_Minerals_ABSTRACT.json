    "context": "[8] However, inHolophaga foetida, Sporobacter termitidis, and Sporobacterium olearium, the O demethylation of methoxylated aromatic compounds did not strictly depend on sulfide (or MT) as methyl group acceptor. [9] O demethylation in strain SA2 appeared to be strictly sulfide dependent , but unfortunately this strain was lost, which made a complete description of the isolate impossible. [1] The present study reports on the impact of methoxylated aromatic compounds on the production of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) in freshwater sediments. [2] Further, the isolation of an obligately anaerobic bacterium which produces DMS and MT during growth on methoxylated aromatic compounds in sulfide-reduced mineral media is described. [3] O demethylation of methoxylated aromatic compounds by our isolate appears to be strictly sulfide dependent. [1] Source of inoculum.Sediment samples were collected from a eutrophic freshwater pond (campus of the Dekkerswald Institute, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). [2] The sediment samples were taken by suction in anaerobic bottles as described by Lomans et al. . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is indirectly related to minerals through its role in the production of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) during the degradation of methoxylated aromatic compounds in mineral media. However, the specific relationship between MSM and minerals is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on microbial processes rather than a direct interaction or dependency on mineral content.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as MSM is involved in a process that occurs in mineral media, but there is no detailed discussion of how MSM specifically interacts with or depends on minerals.",
