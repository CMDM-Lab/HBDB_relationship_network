    "context": "[5] Gram staining of Sporobacterium olearium was positive, whereas that of strain SYR1 was negative. [6] Finally, our isolate produces both MT and DMS from methoxy groups of syringate, whereasSporobacterium olearium produced MT only. [7] Also, the syringate metabolism of strain SYR1 did not appear to be influenced by the presence of H2 in the culture like that ofSporobacterium olearium . [1] In contrast to most of the other closely related organisms of the genera Clostridium, Eubacterium, andRuminococcus, both strain SYR1 and Sporobacterium olearium could not utilize common carbohydrates (e.g., glucose and fructose) as carbon and energy sources. [2] Remarkably, the feature of (methoxylated) aromatic compound metabolism is distributed among various genera . [1] On the basis of its low 16S rRNA sequence similarity (91.8%) with the closest related bacterium, Sporobacterium olearium, as well as its physiological properties, we propose that strain SYR1 is a representative of a novel genus. [2] The isolate was namedParasporobacterium paucivorans. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) and carbohydrates are mentioned in relation to the metabolic capabilities of the bacterial strains SYR1 and Sporobacterium olearium. The strains are noted for their inability to utilize common carbohydrates like glucose and fructose as carbon and energy sources, indicating a distinct metabolic pathway. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship established between MSM and carbohydrates in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both MSM and carbohydrates are discussed in the context of bacterial metabolism, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or significant.",
