[2] Symbols: \u00e2\u2013\u00b4, syringate; \u00e2\u2013\u00aa, MT; \u00e2\u2122\u00a6, DMS; \u00e2\u2014\u008f, acetate; \u00c3\u2014, optical density at 660 nm (OD660). [1] Reducing agents.In cultures of strain SYR1 on syringate, TMB, or gallate, no growth was observed when sulfide was replaced by cysteine, thiosulfate, or Ti(III)NTA. [2] Cysteine, thiosulfate, and Ti(III)NTA were not toxic, since they did not inhibit growth of strain SYR1 when added to sulfide-reduced cultures. [3] Moreover, if sulfide was added to cysteine- or Ti(III)NTA-reduced cultures after prolonged incubation, growth was observed (see also Fig. 3B). [4] The combined addition of sodium sulfide, cysteine, sodium thiosulfate, and Ti(III)NTA usually resulted in higher final MT and DMS concentrations in fully grown cultures. [5] Addition of cysteine also resulted in a slightly higher optical density (at 660 nm) of the final culture (0.184, versus 0.155 on 5 mM syringate). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) and thiosulfates are mentioned in relation to the growth of strain SYR1 on syringate. The study indicates that thiosulfate, along with other reducing agents, did not inhibit the growth of the strain when sulfide was replaced, suggesting a non-toxic relationship. Additionally, the combined addition of thiosulfate with other compounds resulted in higher concentrations of DMS, indicating a potential interaction in metabolic processes involving sulfur compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as thiosulfates are shown to interact with methylsulfanylmethane in the context of microbial growth, but the specifics of their relationship are not deeply explored beyond their co-occurrence in the experimental setup.",
        "score": 3
