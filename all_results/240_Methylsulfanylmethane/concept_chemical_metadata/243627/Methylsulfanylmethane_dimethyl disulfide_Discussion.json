    "context": "In this study, application of the odorant prioritisation matrix reduced the number of potential compounds to be monitored from an initial 20 VOCs and 11 VSCs to less than 8 key and high priority odorants (4 applicable across all sites and another 4 site specific). This reduced compound list could provide a basis for the development of specific monitoring sensors, a more cost effective means of monitoring sewer headspace air odorants. For non-routine monitoring, the results allow key odorants to be targeted, reducing monitoring cost and effort. The odorant prioritisation results also highlight the importance of non-hydrogen sulfide VSCs, in particular methyl mercaptan and reduced sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. It should be noted that OTVs were not available for some compounds. Expanding the range of compounds with available OTVs using a consistent evaluation methodology would enhance the value of the odorant prioritisation methodology. Further evaluation and standardisation of OTV measurement techniques is required to provide high quality data to support odorant evaluation.Implications for odour abatement process evaluation and design Based upon the results of this study, sewer headspace VOCs are unlikely to be a significant contributor to sewer odours and from an odour perspective would not impact upon odour abatement process evaluation and design unless the site has a history of significant trade waste discharges or VOC odour character descriptors.

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odor monitoring in sewer headspace air. The study emphasizes the importance of non-hydrogen sulfide VSCs, including dimethyl disulfide, while methylsulfanylmethane is noted as a key odorant. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed, indicating they are part of a broader category of compounds rather than having a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide, as both are categorized as VSCs relevant to odor monitoring. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
        "score": 2
