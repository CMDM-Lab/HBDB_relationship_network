    "context": "The highest priority odorants were VSCs (Table\u00a08). Methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide were identified as key odorants for all three cities studied, with high odour activity values (>15,000). Ethyl mercaptan was a key odorant for the Perth sites, while it received a moderate priority rating elsewhere due to low appearance frequency. The priority reduced sulfur compounds for all three cities were dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. It should be noted that no OTV was available for dimethyl trisulfide in the Nagata (2003) dataset, so this compound was not evaluated. VOCs A range of VOCs were identified across the Australian sites, with aromatic compounds consistently dominant on a concentration basis. Gas phase sampling results reported in the literature for sewers in Germany (Haas and Herrmann, 1996, 1998), Canada (Corsi et\u00a0al., 1995), and Taiwan (Huang et\u00a0al., 2012) have identified similar dominant VOCs.

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both identified as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odor activity in various cities. While methylsulfanylmethane is not explicitly mentioned as a priority odorant, dimethyl disulfide is highlighted as a significant compound among the reduced sulfur compounds. Their relationship lies in their classification as VSCs, but no direct interaction or functional relationship is discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide, as both are categorized as VSCs relevant to odor activity. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific functional relationships between the two compounds.",
