    "context": "Ethyl mercaptan was consistently detected at the Perth sampling sites but not at the sampling sites in the other two cities, likely reflecting sewer conditions (long retention times) that might promote fermentation processes. Further investigation of sites with high hydrogen sulfide concentrations and long sewage retention times could provide useful information to understand the conditions promoting the formation of this odorant. An odorant prioritisation methodology was developed and utilised to identify key and high priority odorants and reduce the number of potential compounds to be monitored from an initial 31 compounds to 8 key and high priority odorants. While three VOCs and diethyl sulfide were identified as being a priority in a single city, four VSCs were the dominant priority odorants; hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan were key odorants at all sites, and dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide ranged in ranking from high to key priority odorants across the sites. In general, VOCs are unlikely to be a significant contributor to sewer odours and monitoring is not recommended for characterising these compounds. VOC monitoring is recommended for sites with history of significant trade waste discharges or where the odour character descriptors are typical of VOCs. VOCs may have an impact on the effectiveness of odour abatement processes, but further evaluation is needed to determine their fate in odour abatement technologies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) identified in the investigation of sewer odors. While methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide were highlighted as key odorants, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide were noted as varying in priority across different sampling sites. This suggests a relationship where both compounds are part of the broader category of sulfur-based odorants, but their specific interactions or roles in odor formation are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide, as they are both classified as VSCs relevant to odor studies. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific significance in the context provided.",
