(1986) were methyl mercaptan dominated, different from the sites in this study, which was generally dominated by hydrogen sulfide with lower concentrations of the other VSCs. Chan and Hanaeus (2006) also assessed VSC emissions from a pumping station, detecting a wider range of VSCs (dimethyl sulfide 145\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, hydrogen sulfide 40\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, methyl mercaptan 13.7\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, and less than 1\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 of carbon disulfide, ethyl methyl sulfide, diethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide) but also having a less dominant hydrogen sulfide concentration. The other studies presented in the literature mainly provided rankings of the detected VSCs. A summary is provided as Table\u00a09 , with VSCs ranked based upon the relative concentrations in decreasing orders of magnitude from dominant (D) to secondary (S) to tertiary (T). There is general consensus with regards to the importance of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, and a number of studies indicated that dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl sulfide were important VSCs.

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (methyl mercaptan) and diethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detected in emissions from various sources. However, the context primarily focuses on the dominance of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, with diethyl sulfide being noted as present in much lower concentrations. There is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between methylsulfanylmethane and diethyl sulfide beyond their classification as VSCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are categorized as VSCs and mentioned in the same study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific significance in relation to each other.",
