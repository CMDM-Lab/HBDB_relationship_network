    "context": "Ethyl mercaptan was consistently detected at the Perth sampling sites but not at the sampling sites in the other two cities, likely reflecting sewer conditions (long retention times) that might promote fermentation processes. Further investigation of sites with high hydrogen sulfide concentrations and long sewage retention times could provide useful information to understand the conditions promoting the formation of this odorant. An odorant prioritisation methodology was developed and utilised to identify key and high priority odorants and reduce the number of potential compounds to be monitored from an initial 31 compounds to 8 key and high priority odorants. While three VOCs and diethyl sulfide were identified as being a priority in a single city, four VSCs were the dominant priority odorants; hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan were key odorants at all sites, and dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide ranged in ranking from high to key priority odorants across the sites. In general, VOCs are unlikely to be a significant contributor to sewer odours and monitoring is not recommended for characterising these compounds. VOC monitoring is recommended for sites with history of significant trade waste discharges or where the odour character descriptors are typical of VOCs. VOCs may have an impact on the effectiveness of odour abatement processes, but further evaluation is needed to determine their fate in odour abatement technologies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and diethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odorant prioritization in sewage environments. While diethyl sulfide is identified as a priority odorant in a specific city, methyl mercaptan (closely related to methylsulfanylmethane) is noted as a key odorant across all sites. However, there is no direct interaction or detailed relationship established between methylsulfanylmethane and diethyl sulfide beyond their categorization as odorants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VSCs relevant to odor monitoring, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon in the context.",
