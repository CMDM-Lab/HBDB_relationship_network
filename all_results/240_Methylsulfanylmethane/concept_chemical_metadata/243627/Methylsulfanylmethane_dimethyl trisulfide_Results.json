    "context": "Evaluation of odour implications of VSCs In Table\u00a07 , the median, 95th percentile, and maximum measured concentrations of each VSC are compared with associated OTVs (van Gemert, 2003). Nearly all of the 95th percentile VSC concentrations were similar order of magnitude, within, or above the OTV range, thus the potential exists for all VSCs to be odorous. Median concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan (representative of typical conditions in a sewer headspace) were orders of magnitude greater than the reported OTV range and would contribute to odours present in the sewer headspace air. Dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide are expected to be odorants of interest for all sites. When present, ethyl mercaptan was potentially odorous (Table\u00a07), although the related sulfides (diethyl sulfide, diethyl disulfide, and diethyl trisulfide) were only of interest from an odour perspective for Perth sampling sites. While the potential exists for carbon disulfide concentrations to reach odorous levels on an episodic basis, it is generally expected to be a minor or non-odorous component of sewer headspace air in Sydney and Melbourne, and is primarily of interest for the Perth sites.Odorant prioritisation Odour activity values were determined by dividing the 95th percentile concentration data (presented in Tables\u00a04 and 7 for VOCs and VSCs, respectively) by OTVs obtained from Nagata (2003). 95th percentile concentrations were chosen as they provide an upper bounds while screening out low frequency disturbances/episodes not representative of typical conditions.

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl trisulfide are both volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) mentioned in relation to their potential odorous implications in sewer headspace air. While the text discusses various VSCs and their concentrations, it does not provide a direct comparison or specific interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl trisulfide, indicating they are part of a broader category of odorants of interest without detailing their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VSCs relevant to odor analysis, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
