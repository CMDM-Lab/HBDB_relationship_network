    "context": "A similar set of VSCs were generally observed in the studies reported in literature. Two studies (Kangas et\u00a0al., 1986; Sheng et\u00a0al., 2008) provided quantitative VSC data. While monitoring at two municipal wastewater treatment plants in Guangzhou China, Sheng et\u00a0al. (2008) detected carbonyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide and carbon disulfide at concentrations significantly lower than those observed in this study, in many cases on the order of a factor of 10 lower. Methyl mercaptan was not detected in the gas phase, which is not consistent with the results of this study nor with the other studies (Kangas et\u00a0al., 1986; Thistlethwayte and Goleb, 1973; Devai and DeLaune, 1999; Ras et\u00a0al., 2008; Li and Shooter, 2004) presented in the literature. Kangas et\u00a0al. (1986) studied sulfur compound emissions from 16 municipal wastewater treatment plants and 18 pumping stations in Finland. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and carbonyl sulfide are both volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) mentioned in studies monitoring emissions from wastewater treatment plants. While carbonyl sulfide was detected at lower concentrations in the studies referenced, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are part of a broader analysis of sulfur emissions but are not shown to influence each other or share a specific functional connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VSCs studied in similar contexts, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the provided context.",
