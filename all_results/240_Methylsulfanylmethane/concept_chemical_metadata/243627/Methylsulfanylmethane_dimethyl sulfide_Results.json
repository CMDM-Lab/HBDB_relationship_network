    "context": "The highest priority odorants were VSCs (Table\u00a08). Methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide were identified as key odorants for all three cities studied, with high odour activity values (>15,000). Ethyl mercaptan was a key odorant for the Perth sites, while it received a moderate priority rating elsewhere due to low appearance frequency. The priority reduced sulfur compounds for all three cities were dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide. It should be noted that no OTV was available for dimethyl trisulfide in the Nagata (2003) dataset, so this compound was not evaluated. VOCs A range of VOCs were identified across the Australian sites, with aromatic compounds consistently dominant on a concentration basis. Gas phase sampling results reported in the literature for sewers in Germany (Haas and Herrmann, 1996, 1998), Canada (Corsi et\u00a0al., 1995), and Taiwan (Huang et\u00a0al., 2012) have identified similar dominant VOCs.

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) identified as key odorants in various cities. While they are part of the same category of compounds and are prioritized in odor studies, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between the two compounds, merely listing them among other VSCs without further elaboration on their specific roles or connections.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are categorized as VSCs and are noted for their odor activity. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
