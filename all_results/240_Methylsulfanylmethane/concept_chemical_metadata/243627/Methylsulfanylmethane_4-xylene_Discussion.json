    "context": "The VOCs identified by Huang et\u00a0al. were similar to those identified in this study, and the measured concentrations were of similar order of magnitude. The remaining published sewer VOC data is based on liquid phase (sewage) sampling, although as shown by Haas and Herrmann (1996) it is expected that the range of VOCs identified in the sewage will be present in the headspace air. A similar range of VOCs to those identified in this study (Table\u00a03) have been observed during sewage sampling at municipal wastewater treatment plant inlets in Spain (Escalas et\u00a0al., 2003), Italy (Fatone et\u00a0al., 2011), and Greece (Nikolaou et\u00a0al., 2002), with toluene consistently being identified as a dominant VOCs along with trimethylbenzene and m,p-xylene. Halogenated hydrocarbons were also identified in these studies (Escalas et\u00a0al., 2003; Nikolaou et\u00a0al., 2002). Given that a similar range of VOCs (and in many cases dominant VOCs) have been identified in sewer headspace air and sewage across diverse countries and climatic regions, the data and conclusions presented in this paper are not restricted to the Australian context and are useful for identifying the odour implications of sewer headspace VOCs for the wider industry. With most 95th percentile VOC concentrations below their associated OTVs, sewer headspace VOCs are unlikely to be a significant contributor to sewer odours. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in studies related to sewage and wastewater treatment. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships. They are part of a broader analysis of VOCs present in sewer headspace air, but their individual roles or connections are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methylsulfanylmethane and 4-xylene are simply listed among other VOCs without any specific interaction or relevance discussed in the context.",
