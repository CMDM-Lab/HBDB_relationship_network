    "context": "Local incidences of anoxia that ended in fish kills following strong seasonal eutrophication were noted in the inner part of Izmir Bay for a long time. Hydrogen sulfide is usually taken as the principal odorous component created by the problem of anoxia in closed sea environments (Spiro and Stigliani, 1996). Yet, it was thought that other sulfur containing organic gases in the sulfur cycle possibly accompanied hydrogen sulfide in Izmir. Thus, several organic sulfur compounds such as methane thiol, ethane thiol, n- and 2-propane thiol, 2-butane thiol, dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide as well as thiophene, diphenylsulfide along with hydrogen sulfide gas were studied in the odorous air of urban sites at the beginning and end of summer 2001. Scientific data on organic sulfur compound measurements in the air can be found in a diversity of scientific disciplines. Among them the winery, garlic and other therapeutic foodstuff, dentistry, medical areas can be counted. Environmental evaluations citing such data are frequent around industries such as Kraft pulp and paper mills, rayon and other artificial fiber plants. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned as one of several organic sulfur compounds studied in relation to the odorous air in urban environments affected by seasonal eutrophication. It is grouped with other organic sulfur compounds like dimethylsulfide and thiophene, indicating that methylsulfanylmethane is part of a broader category of organic sulfur compounds that contribute to environmental and health-related studies. However, the specific role or significance of methylsulfanylmethane in comparison to other organic sulfur compounds is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between methylsulfanylmethane and organic sulfur compounds, as they are both included in a list of compounds studied for their environmental impact. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or unique significance.",
