    "context": "Higher dimethylsulfide, 2-buthane thiol and H2S concentrations were found in the air in June than in September. SO2 values were also lower in September air samples. Measured data indicated that the odor generating capacity of the creeks have been reduced after domestic and industrial wastewater discharges were cut off. Disregarding the low molecular weight thiols that could not be found, 2-propane thiol and 2-butane thiol as well as the dimethylsulfide and H2S were found to be the major components in emissions and ambient air. All of these emission concentrations have notably reduced between June and September 2001 campaigns. Occasional appearance of diphenylsulfide in June samples needs more careful investigations for sources. Thiophenes have possibly arisen in creek waters due to fuel contamination upstream and exhaust gases of dense traffic near the creek sites. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (dimethylsulfide) and propane are both mentioned as components of air emissions, particularly in relation to odor generation from creeks affected by wastewater discharges. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly detailed, and they are discussed in the context of different sulfur compounds without direct interaction or comparison. Their mention is more about their presence in air samples rather than a significant chemical or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Methylsulfanylmethane and propane are part of the broader discussion on air emissions, but there is no detailed interaction or specific relevance between the two compounds in the context provided.",
