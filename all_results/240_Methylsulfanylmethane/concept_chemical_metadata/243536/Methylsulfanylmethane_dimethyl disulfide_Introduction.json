    "context": "Occupational levels of airborne sulfur bearing compounds and estimated health effects upon exposure are submitted especially in industrial air pollution studies. Air composition around foully smelling piggeries and manure storage houses as sources of odorous organic sulfur compounds has also been studied. Clanton et al. (1999) found maximum 0.05 mgm\u22123 methane thiol, 0.112 mgm\u22123 dimethylsulfide and 3.92 mgm\u22123 H2S concentrations in air samples taken from a manure storage area. In this study that included 20 sulfur-containing compounds, only H2S, carbonyl sulfide, methane thiol, dimethylsulfide, carbon disulfide and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air samples. In addition to air samples, isopropane thiol was found in liquid samples taken from the manure area. More recently, biogenic emission data from the seas (Kouvarakis and Mihailopoulos, 2002) and from the wetlands (Watts, 2000) have been added to further enlarge the wide range of studies on organic sulfur compounds literature. Atmospheric conversion of sulfur bearing organic molecules into sulfur oxides and then to sulfates is an important mechanism in secondary particulate matter formation (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as sulfur-containing compounds detected in air samples from manure storage areas. While they are part of a broader study on airborne sulfur compounds and their health effects, the specific relationship or interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide is not detailed. They are included in a list of compounds analyzed for their presence in the environment, indicating a shared category but lacking direct interaction or functional relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the same study on sulfur-bearing compounds in air samples, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
