    "context": "Resulting chromatograms were studied for the retention time of each added pure compound. Gas standard mixtures were also analyzed with GC\u2013MS and the retention times were confirmed. Known concentrations in the final gas mixture and the integration results based on peak heights were used for calibration. Samples were analyzed for methane thiol, ethane thiol, 2-propane thiol, dimethylsulfide, 2-butane thiol and dimethyldisulfide. But no methane thiol, ethane thiol and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air. Limits of detection for methane thiol and ethane thiol were 0.20 and 0.25 mgm\u22123, respectively. Detection limits for propane thiol and butane thiol were both 0.35 mgm\u22123. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both mentioned as compounds analyzed in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) studies. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are part of a broader analysis of various thiol compounds, but their specific connection is not explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are simply listed among other compounds analyzed without any indication of their interaction or relevance to each other in the context provided.",
