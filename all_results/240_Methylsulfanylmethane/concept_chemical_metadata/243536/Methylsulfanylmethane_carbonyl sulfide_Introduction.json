    "context": "Occupational levels of airborne sulfur bearing compounds and estimated health effects upon exposure are submitted especially in industrial air pollution studies. Air composition around foully smelling piggeries and manure storage houses as sources of odorous organic sulfur compounds has also been studied. Clanton et al. (1999) found maximum 0.05 mgm\u22123 methane thiol, 0.112 mgm\u22123 dimethylsulfide and 3.92 mgm\u22123 H2S concentrations in air samples taken from a manure storage area. In this study that included 20 sulfur-containing compounds, only H2S, carbonyl sulfide, methane thiol, dimethylsulfide, carbon disulfide and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air samples. In addition to air samples, isopropane thiol was found in liquid samples taken from the manure area. More recently, biogenic emission data from the seas (Kouvarakis and Mihailopoulos, 2002) and from the wetlands (Watts, 2000) have been added to further enlarge the wide range of studies on organic sulfur compounds literature. Atmospheric conversion of sulfur bearing organic molecules into sulfur oxides and then to sulfates is an important mechanism in secondary particulate matter formation (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and carbonyl sulfide are both mentioned as sulfur-bearing compounds found in air samples from industrial and agricultural sources, particularly around piggeries and manure storage areas. While they are part of a broader study on airborne sulfur compounds, the specific relationship or interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and carbonyl sulfide is not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are included in a study of sulfur-bearing compounds in the air, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships.",
