    "context": "Local incidences of anoxia that ended in fish kills following strong seasonal eutrophication were noted in the inner part of Izmir Bay for a long time. Hydrogen sulfide is usually taken as the principal odorous component created by the problem of anoxia in closed sea environments (Spiro and Stigliani, 1996). Yet, it was thought that other sulfur containing organic gases in the sulfur cycle possibly accompanied hydrogen sulfide in Izmir. Thus, several organic sulfur compounds such as methane thiol, ethane thiol, n- and 2-propane thiol, 2-butane thiol, dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide as well as thiophene, diphenylsulfide along with hydrogen sulfide gas were studied in the odorous air of urban sites at the beginning and end of summer 2001. Scientific data on organic sulfur compound measurements in the air can be found in a diversity of scientific disciplines. Among them the winery, garlic and other therapeutic foodstuff, dentistry, medical areas can be counted. Environmental evaluations citing such data are frequent around industries such as Kraft pulp and paper mills, rayon and other artificial fiber plants. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and butane are both mentioned as organic sulfur compounds that may be present in the odorous air of urban sites, particularly in relation to environmental issues like anoxia and eutrophication. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships, indicating a general association rather than a detailed connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as methylsulfanylmethane and butane are both categorized as organic sulfur compounds in the context of environmental studies, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or explored beyond their mention in the same context.",
        "score": 2
