    "context": "Among them the winery, garlic and other therapeutic foodstuff, dentistry, medical areas can be counted. Environmental evaluations citing such data are frequent around industries such as Kraft pulp and paper mills, rayon and other artificial fiber plants. For example, data from Bordado and Gomes (2001) showed that measured emission concentrations of H2S up to 4032 mgm\u22123, methane thiol up to 25600 mgm\u22123, dimethylsulfide up to 61000 mgm\u22123 and dimethyldisulfide up to 1125 mgm\u22123 were measured in Kraft pulp mill operations. For the ambient air around a chemical fiber manufacturing facility, maximum concentrations of H2S of 85.6 \u03bcgm\u22123, dimethylsulfide of 39.9 \u03bcgm\u22123 and 2-propane thiol of 57.9 \u03bcgm\u22123 were reported in Taiwan (Lin, 2001). Occupational levels of airborne sulfur bearing compounds and estimated health effects upon exposure are submitted especially in industrial air pollution studies. Air composition around foully smelling piggeries and manure storage houses as sources of odorous organic sulfur compounds has also been studied. Clanton et al. (1999) found maximum 0.05 mgm\u22123 methane thiol, 0.112 mgm\u22123 dimethylsulfide and 3.92 mgm\u22123 H2S concentrations in air samples taken from a manure storage area. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned alongside various sulfur-bearing chemicals, particularly in relation to environmental evaluations and emissions from industrial sources. While it is categorized as a chemical, the text does not provide specific interactions or detailed relationships between Methylsulfanylmethane and other chemicals. Instead, it highlights the broader context of sulfur compounds in industrial emissions and their potential health effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Methylsulfanylmethane is grouped with other chemicals in discussions about emissions and environmental impact, but there is no detailed exploration of its specific relationship with other chemicals.",
