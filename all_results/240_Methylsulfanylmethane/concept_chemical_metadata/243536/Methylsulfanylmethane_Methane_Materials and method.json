    "context": "Known concentrations in the final gas mixture and the integration results based on peak heights were used for calibration. Samples were analyzed for methane thiol, ethane thiol, 2-propane thiol, dimethylsulfide, 2-butane thiol and dimethyldisulfide. But no methane thiol, ethane thiol and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air. Limits of detection for methane thiol and ethane thiol were 0.20 and 0.25 mgm\u22123, respectively. Detection limits for propane thiol and butane thiol were both 0.35 mgm\u22123. In gas chromatography a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 was used throughout the integrations. No peaks corresponding to the studied substances were detected in the blanks. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and methane are both mentioned as components analyzed in a gas mixture. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. The focus is on the detection limits and analysis of various thiols, with no specific mention of how methylsulfanylmethane relates to methane in terms of chemical properties or biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as methylsulfanylmethane and methane are simply listed among other substances analyzed without any indication of a functional or chemical relationship between them.",
