    "context": "Higher dimethylsulfide, 2-buthane thiol and H2S concentrations were found in the air in June than in September. SO2 values were also lower in September air samples. Measured data indicated that the odor generating capacity of the creeks have been reduced after domestic and industrial wastewater discharges were cut off. Disregarding the low molecular weight thiols that could not be found, 2-propane thiol and 2-butane thiol as well as the dimethylsulfide and H2S were found to be the major components in emissions and ambient air. All of these emission concentrations have notably reduced between June and September 2001 campaigns. Occasional appearance of diphenylsulfide in June samples needs more careful investigations for sources. Thiophenes have possibly arisen in creek waters due to fuel contamination upstream and exhaust gases of dense traffic near the creek sites. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (dimethylsulfide) and butane are both mentioned as components of air emissions, with a focus on their concentrations in relation to environmental changes. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between the two compounds. They are part of a broader analysis of air quality and odor-generating compounds, but their specific roles or connections are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Methylsulfanylmethane and butane are included in the discussion of air emissions, but there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions within the context provided.",
