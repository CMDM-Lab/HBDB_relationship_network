    "context": "Among them the winery, garlic and other therapeutic foodstuff, dentistry, medical areas can be counted. Environmental evaluations citing such data are frequent around industries such as Kraft pulp and paper mills, rayon and other artificial fiber plants. For example, data from Bordado and Gomes (2001) showed that measured emission concentrations of H2S up to 4032 mgm\u22123, methane thiol up to 25600 mgm\u22123, dimethylsulfide up to 61000 mgm\u22123 and dimethyldisulfide up to 1125 mgm\u22123 were measured in Kraft pulp mill operations. For the ambient air around a chemical fiber manufacturing facility, maximum concentrations of H2S of 85.6 \u03bcgm\u22123, dimethylsulfide of 39.9 \u03bcgm\u22123 and 2-propane thiol of 57.9 \u03bcgm\u22123 were reported in Taiwan (Lin, 2001). Occupational levels of airborne sulfur bearing compounds and estimated health effects upon exposure are submitted especially in industrial air pollution studies. Air composition around foully smelling piggeries and manure storage houses as sources of odorous organic sulfur compounds has also been studied. Clanton et al. (1999) found maximum 0.05 mgm\u22123 methane thiol, 0.112 mgm\u22123 dimethylsulfide and 3.92 mgm\u22123 H2S concentrations in air samples taken from a manure storage area. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and propane are both mentioned in relation to environmental evaluations of air quality around industrial sites, particularly those emitting sulfur-bearing compounds. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between the two compounds. They are part of a broader discussion on emissions from various industries, but their connection is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Methylsulfanylmethane and propane are both included in the context of industrial emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions. They share a general category of being volatile compounds but lack a direct connection.",
