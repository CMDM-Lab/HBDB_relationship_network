    "context": "Resulting chromatograms were studied for the retention time of each added pure compound. Gas standard mixtures were also analyzed with GC\u2013MS and the retention times were confirmed. Known concentrations in the final gas mixture and the integration results based on peak heights were used for calibration. Samples were analyzed for methane thiol, ethane thiol, 2-propane thiol, dimethylsulfide, 2-butane thiol and dimethyldisulfide. But no methane thiol, ethane thiol and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air. Limits of detection for methane thiol and ethane thiol were 0.20 and 0.25 mgm\u22123, respectively. Detection limits for propane thiol and butane thiol were both 0.35 mgm\u22123. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and propane are both mentioned as compounds analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for their retention times in gas mixtures. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them. They are part of a broader analysis of various thiols, but their specific roles or connections are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methylsulfanylmethane and propane are simply listed among other compounds analyzed in the study without any direct relevance or interaction described.",
