    "context": "Occupational levels of airborne sulfur bearing compounds and estimated health effects upon exposure are submitted especially in industrial air pollution studies. Air composition around foully smelling piggeries and manure storage houses as sources of odorous organic sulfur compounds has also been studied. Clanton et al. (1999) found maximum 0.05 mgm\u22123 methane thiol, 0.112 mgm\u22123 dimethylsulfide and 3.92 mgm\u22123 H2S concentrations in air samples taken from a manure storage area. In this study that included 20 sulfur-containing compounds, only H2S, carbonyl sulfide, methane thiol, dimethylsulfide, carbon disulfide and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air samples. In addition to air samples, isopropane thiol was found in liquid samples taken from the manure area. More recently, biogenic emission data from the seas (Kouvarakis and Mihailopoulos, 2002) and from the wetlands (Watts, 2000) have been added to further enlarge the wide range of studies on organic sulfur compounds literature. Atmospheric conversion of sulfur bearing organic molecules into sulfur oxides and then to sulfates is an important mechanism in secondary particulate matter formation (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and methane are both mentioned as sulfur-bearing compounds found in the air around manure storage areas. While methane is specifically identified as a compound detected in air samples, methylsulfanylmethane is not directly linked to any specific health effects or interactions with methane. The focus is on the presence of various sulfur compounds in the environment, indicating a general association rather than a detailed relationship between the two.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both methylsulfanylmethane and methane are part of a broader discussion on sulfur compounds in air pollution studies, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
        "score": 2
