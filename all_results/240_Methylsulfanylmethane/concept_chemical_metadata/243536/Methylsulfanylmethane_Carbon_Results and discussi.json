    "context": "GC-chemilumiscence analyses were carried out by means of a Hewlett Packard instrument at the petroleum refinery in Izmir, Turkey. Measurement results of the source emission concentrations and ambient air are presented in Table 1 . During the first series of tests in June, Meles\u2013Arap joint segment was highly polluted with organic sulfur compounds. Dimethylsulfide concentrations in the open air were found higher than emitted gases sampled when a carbon inlet filter was used in the flux chamber (samples numbered 2 and 3\u20134). Without this inlet air prefilter, very similar levels in the ambient air and emissions were found (samples 1 and 3\u20134). Nearly all creek samples in June had similar dimethylsulfide concentrations. H2S emission concentrations from the polluted water surface were higher than the outside air. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (specifically dimethylsulfide) is discussed in relation to carbon emissions at a petroleum refinery. The analysis indicates that the presence of a carbon inlet filter affects the concentration measurements of dimethylsulfide in the air. However, the relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and carbon is primarily about their coexistence in the environment rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to air quality measurements at the refinery, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance beyond their presence in the same environmental context.",
        "score": 2
