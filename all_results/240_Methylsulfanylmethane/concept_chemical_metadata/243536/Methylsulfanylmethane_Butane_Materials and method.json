    "context": "Resulting chromatograms were studied for the retention time of each added pure compound. Gas standard mixtures were also analyzed with GC\u2013MS and the retention times were confirmed. Known concentrations in the final gas mixture and the integration results based on peak heights were used for calibration. Samples were analyzed for methane thiol, ethane thiol, 2-propane thiol, dimethylsulfide, 2-butane thiol and dimethyldisulfide. But no methane thiol, ethane thiol and dimethyldisulfide could be detected in the air. Limits of detection for methane thiol and ethane thiol were 0.20 and 0.25 mgm\u22123, respectively. Detection limits for propane thiol and butane thiol were both 0.35 mgm\u22123. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and Butane are both mentioned as compounds analyzed in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) studies. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between them. They are part of a broader analysis of various thiols and their detection limits in air samples, indicating they are simply components of the same analytical process without any specific relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Methylsulfanylmethane and Butane are only mentioned in the context of a chromatographic analysis without any direct interaction or functional relationship described.",
