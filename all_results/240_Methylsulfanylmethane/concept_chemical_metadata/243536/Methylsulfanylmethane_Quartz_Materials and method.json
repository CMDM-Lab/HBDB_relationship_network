    "context": "This was always below 50% of the first section and this can be accepted to show efficient retention of H2S in all samples. For gas chromatographic samples, vials containing the extracts were covered with plastic films before they were capped. Samples and standards were always kept and all handling operations were carried out under a hood with strong negative pressure to avoid cross contamination. In gas chromatography gas-phase standards were prepared by injecting known amounts of chromatographic grade pure methane thiol, ethane thiol, 2-propane thiol, 2-butane thiol, dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide into a quartz gas chamber at successive steps. After each addition, the mixture was held under a heat-lamp until the added chemical completely evaporated. Obtained gas mixtures were used as standards. Resulting chromatograms were studied for the retention time of each added pure compound. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (a sulfur-containing compound) and quartz (a type of mineral) are mentioned in relation to gas chromatography procedures. Quartz is used as a material for the gas chamber where gas-phase standards are prepared, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between methylsulfanylmethane and quartz. Their connection is limited to the experimental setup rather than any chemical or biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as methylsulfanylmethane and quartz are only mentioned in the context of gas chromatography without any direct interaction or relevance to each other beyond their roles in the experimental procedure.",
        "score": 1
