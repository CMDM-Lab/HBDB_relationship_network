    "context": "[10] Activity screening of fractions obtained by fast performance liquid chromatography gel filtration demonstrated that all of the activity resided in only one fraction with a molecular mass of about 200 kDa. [11] MT formation was found after addition of the following substrates: 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate, TMB, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate (vanillate), and 4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoate (syringate). [12] No MT formation was found after addition of 3,5-dimethoxybenzoate. [1] Phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis.A 1,530-bp DNA fragment homologous to the rRNA gene of strain SYR1 was amplified in vitro, cloned in the pCR II vector, transformed in E. coli, and sequenced. [2] Use of the Chimera Check analysis of the Ribosomal Database Project  showed that the sequence was indeed derived from a single target DNA sequence. [3] Database searches revealed that the highest similarity value (91.8%) was found for the sequences of strain SYR1 and Sporobacterium olearium. [4] A phylogenetic tree based on a matrix of distances of a 1,487-bp fragment of the 16S rRNA gene clearly shows that strain SYR1 clusters within subclass XIVa of the very polymorphic Clostridiales (Fig.5).

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly discussed in relation to the homologous gene. The focus is primarily on the activity screening of various substrates and the phylogenetic analysis of a DNA fragment homologous to the rRNA gene of strain SYR1. While both terms are mentioned, there is no clear connection or interaction established between them in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and the homologous gene, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct interaction or relevance.",
