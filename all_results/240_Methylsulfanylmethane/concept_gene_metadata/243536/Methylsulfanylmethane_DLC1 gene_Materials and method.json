    "context": "Two microliters of the dichloroethane-extracted samples were introduced at 1:10 split ratio. A temperature program of 76 min was set by holding the oven for 5 min at 40 \u00b0C, then heating by 2 \u00b0Cmin\u22121 up to 150 \u00b0C followed by a constant temperature phase for 1 min and then rapid heating by 15 \u00b0Cmin\u22121 up to 240 \u00b0C for cleaning the column. Rest of the time until the end of the program was to clean the column by complete destruction of any organic contaminants at this temperature. The samples from June period were also analyzed by means of a HP-GC with a chemilumiscence detector to find additional organic sulfur compounds of 2-propane thiol, 2-methyl-2-propane thiol, thiophene, diethylsulfide, 2-methylthiophene, diphenylsulfide. Among them 2-propane thiol, thiophene and diphenylsulfide could be found in the samples. Propane thiol values from chemilumiscence were very close to the values found by FPD-sulfur detector for the same samples.Quality assurance High purity water, chromatographic grade solvents, standards and pure laboratory chemicals were used in sampling, extraction and analyses. Together with the samples and standards, blanks consisting of a suitable number of unexposed filters and tubes that were brought to the field, as well as unused reagents were analyzed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and the DLC1 gene are mentioned in relation to the analysis of organic sulfur compounds, but there is no direct connection or discussion of their relationship. The focus is primarily on the extraction and analysis of various sulfur compounds without linking them to the DLC1 gene or its functions. Therefore, their relationship remains unclear and unsubstantiated.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and the DLC1 gene, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
