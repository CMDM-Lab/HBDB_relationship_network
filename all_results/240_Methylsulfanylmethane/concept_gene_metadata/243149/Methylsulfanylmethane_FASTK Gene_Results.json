    "context": "Two hours after damage, the emissions had returned to control levels, indicating that the reaction between myrosinase and the glucosinolates had ended. Renewed damage, however, initiated the reaction again resulting in increased m/z 60 emissions (Fig. 6). From this figure it can also be seen that artificial damage has no direct effect on DMS (m/z 63) and DMDS (m/z 95) signals; methanethiol (m/z 49) showed increased emissions after artificial damage, though much smaller than the one observed for m/z 60. The rapid increase of m/z 60 supports our hypothesis that the fast m/z 60 emissions result from the rapid conversion of glucosinolates by the enzyme myrosinase and possibly other enzymes involved in glucosinolate conversion (Wittstock et al., 2003).Influence of larval instar on the temporal profile In addition, the influence of the larval developmental stage, or instar, on the temporal emission profile or intensity of the emissions was studied. For this, m/z 60 (HCNS) was chosen as a marker, because of its high reproducibility, and the quick and strong signal that was measured directly after infestation. Fig. 7 shows m/z 60 emissions of roots infested with four small first instar larvae, four large late second instar larvae, and control roots. At the end of the experiments, actively feeding larvae were found in all replicates infested with first instar larvae, on average two in each root. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is mentioned in relation to emissions resulting from the enzymatic conversion of glucosinolates by myrosinase, while the FASTK gene is not directly referenced or linked to any specific function or interaction with DMS. The context primarily discusses the emissions related to plant damage and does not provide any evidence of a relationship between DMS and the FASTK gene, which is typically associated with mitochondrial function and RNA processing.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between Methylsulfanylmethane and the FASTK gene in the provided context. They are mentioned separately without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
