    "context": "were measured in test persons after inhalation of 50ppm (212.5mg/m3) styrene (Johanson et al., 2000). The concentrations of styrene used in these investigations corresponded with the maximum concentrations Tornero-Velez and Rappaport (2001) had measured at industrial workplaces where styrene was processed. The concentrations were far higher than the maximum workplace concentration of 90mg/m3 (Naumann et al., 1998), the concentration in cigarette smoke (about 3mg/m3) as well as the styrene concentration in outside (1\u20133\u03bcg/m3) or indoor air (10\u201350\u03bcg/m3) (Tang et al., 2000). When taking into consideration, the short half life of styrene-7.8-oxide in solution, concentrations in our cell culture can be compared with above mentioned blood concentrations. Hence, it is possible that similar stimulating effects occur in individuals with permanent occupational exposure. From this it is to be derived that the TH1-stimulation of human immune cells found in our experiments exhibits a biological and clinical relevance regarding the inhalation of styrene or styrene-7.8-oxide ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its inhalation exposure and potential effects on human immune cells. However, there is no direct mention or evidence linking styrene to Tangier Disease, a genetic disorder affecting lipid metabolism and characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The relationship between styrene exposure and Tangier Disease is not established, indicating a lack of direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that while styrene is mentioned in the context of inhalation studies, there is no discussion or evidence connecting it to Tangier Disease. They appear coincidentally without any direct relationship.",
