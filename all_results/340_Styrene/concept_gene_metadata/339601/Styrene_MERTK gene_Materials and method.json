    "context": "An icebox impingement condenser (Pyrex) and two particle filter (Balston, 95S6 and 45G) were installed between the sampling port and O2 analyzer. This arrangement was designed to prevent the analyzer from damaging by condensed water and particles. All mass flow meters and rotameters used in this study were calibrated by a bubble meter (Humonic digital flow meter 650) or a dry gas meter (Shinagawa DK-SCF-T) at their proper ranges. Styrene standard was a product of Merk Chemicals Inc. (5000 \u03bcg/ml in methanol). Standard gases included zero gas (N2, 99.9995%, San Fu) and O2 span gas (21%, San Fu). The catalyst was a commercial product of NISSAN GIRDLER N-150 MnO/Fe2O3. Its basic properties are shown in Table 1 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is mentioned as a standard chemical used in a study involving gas analysis, while the MERTK gene is not referenced at all. There is no discussion or indication of any relationship between styrene and the MERTK gene, as the context focuses solely on the technical setup for measuring gas concentrations without any biological implications or connections to genetic factors.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relationship between styrene and the MERTK gene, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any direct or indirect connection or relevance to each other.",
