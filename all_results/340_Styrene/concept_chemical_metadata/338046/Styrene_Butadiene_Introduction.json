    "context": "The separation of the gas membrane remedied the biofilter defects and strengthened the biofilter by prolonging retention time and maintaining enough styrene for the growth of styrene-degrading species when overloading occurred. Gas membrane modules can be installed in series following the biofilter, and therefore the optimum number of membrane modules and pressure differences could be selected according to the concentration of styrene from the biofilter. This novel approach to biofiltration lays a foundation for integrated control technology. Styrene is one of the most important aromatic chemicals used as raw material in the production of many commercially important products such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene (ABS), styrene\u2013isoprene\u2013styrene, and styrene\u2013butadiene latexes and rubbers. The release of man-made styrene into environment can occur by various routes including the disposal of petrochemical wastewaters and pyrolysis of polystyrene. The most common method employed for degradation of hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as styrene, in petrochemical wastewaters is the conventional activated sludge processes (CASPs). This process has been successfully used for the treatment of petrochemical wastewaters; the treated effluent from this process usually meets the industrial standards for the disposal of wastewaters.

        "summary": "In this context, styrene and butadiene are both mentioned as important chemicals in the production of various commercial products, including polystyrene and styrene\u2013butadiene latexes. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed in terms of their chemical interactions or metabolic pathways. Styrene is highlighted for its role in biofiltration processes, while butadiene is not directly addressed, indicating a lack of detailed connection between the two in this specific context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both styrene and butadiene are recognized as significant chemicals in the petrochemical industry, but their relationship is not elaborated upon in the context provided.",
