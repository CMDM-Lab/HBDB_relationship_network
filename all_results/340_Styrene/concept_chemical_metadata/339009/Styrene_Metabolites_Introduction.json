    "context": "To date, there are only a few reports of individual cases with connections between occupational exposure to styrene and the occurrence of allergic diseases (Oner et al., 2004; Minamoto et al., 2002; Hayes et al., 1991; Moscato et al., 1984). Surprisingly, to our knowledge no data exist on the influence of styrene or styrene-7.8-oxide on the immune system or a possible role in the development of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro modulation of the human immune response by SO, the main metabolite of styrene in the human organism. Another goal was to determine whether the two enantiomeric forms of SO show different results regarding the immune response. For that purpose, we used mononuclear leukocyte cell cultures which were incubated with both SO enantiomers and its racemic mixture. From supernatants TH1- and TH2-cytokines as representatives of the immune response were measured. ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is linked to its main metabolite, styrene-7.8-oxide (SO), which is investigated for its effects on the human immune response. The study aims to explore how SO, particularly its enantiomers, modulates cytokine production in mononuclear leukocyte cultures, indicating a direct relationship between styrene exposure and its metabolic effects on immune function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between styrene and its metabolite, styrene-7.8-oxide, as the study directly investigates the immune response modulation by this metabolite, supported by experimental design and cytokine measurement.",
        "score": 4
