    "context": "Further sources like food, industrial emissions, or exhaust fumes play a minor role (Tang et al., 2000). Styrene is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 mainly to styrene-7.8-oxide (SO; Fig. 1 ; Sumner and Fennell, 1994). SO is due to its epoxide ring a very reactive substance, which is present in two enantiomeric forms, (R)-SO and (S)-SO, and is responsible for the toxic effects of styrene in the organism (IARC, 1994, 2002). Environmental contamination is insignificant as styrene-7.8-oxide has a short half life when exposed to water or air. As a result of efficient metabolization in vivo after exposure, only 2% of styrene enters the blood circuit, mainly as SO (Tornero-Velez and Rappaport, 2001). ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its metabolism into styrene-7,8-oxide (SO), which is an epoxy compound. SO, characterized by its reactive epoxide ring, is responsible for the toxic effects associated with styrene exposure. This indicates a direct relationship where styrene is a precursor to the formation of epoxy compounds, specifically SO, which has significant biological implications due to its reactivity and toxicity.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as styrene is directly metabolized into an epoxy compound (styrene-7,8-oxide), which is highlighted as responsible for the toxic effects of styrene. This clear metabolic pathway establishes a critical relationship between the two terms.",
