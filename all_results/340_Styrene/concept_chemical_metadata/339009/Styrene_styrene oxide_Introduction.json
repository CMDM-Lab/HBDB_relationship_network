    "context": "According to hitherto studies, the attack on the genetic material is to be estimated due to the effective repair mechanisms less serious than the modification of proteins (Laffon et al., 2002; Biro et al., 2002). Most investigations in this context focused on carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects by adduct formation. To date, there are only a few reports of individual cases with connections between occupational exposure to styrene and the occurrence of allergic diseases (Oner et al., 2004; Minamoto et al., 2002; Hayes et al., 1991; Moscato et al., 1984). Surprisingly, to our knowledge no data exist on the influence of styrene or styrene-7.8-oxide on the immune system or a possible role in the development of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro modulation of the human immune response by SO, the main metabolite of styrene in the human organism. Another goal was to determine whether the two enantiomeric forms of SO show different results regarding the immune response. ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene and styrene oxide (SO) are related through the investigation of SO as the main metabolite of styrene in the human body. The study aims to explore how SO may modulate the human immune response, particularly in relation to allergic diseases, which have been linked to styrene exposure. However, the specific interactions between styrene and SO in terms of immune modulation are not well-documented, indicating a need for further research.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between styrene and styrene oxide, as the study focuses on the immune response modulation by SO, a metabolite of styrene. The context suggests a clear relationship, although the exact mechanisms and effects are still under investigation.",
