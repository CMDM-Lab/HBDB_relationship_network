    "context": "As expected from Table 2, there is a significant dominance of stimulation of TH1-cytokines with the highest values for racemic SO, followed by equal values for (S)-SO and (R)-SO. Furthermore, TH1-cytokines are influenced by the toxic effects in a higher extent compared to TH2-cytokines. Parallel to Table 2, the (R)-enantiomer exhibits the highest toxic effect, whereas racemic SO is responsible for the highest stimulation. Styrene and its main metabolite styrene-7.8-oxide are well studied regarding their toxicity and have been related to mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. In this study, the immunomodulating capacities of SO were investigated using the analysis of cytokine secretion of human mononuclear cells. Cytokine responses to increasing SO concentrations in the cell culture showed a biphasic curve progression (Fig. 2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is directly related to its metabolite, styrene-7,8-oxide, which is highlighted for its toxicity and potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. The study investigates the immunomodulating capacities of styrene-7,8-oxide, indicating a significant relationship between styrene and its metabolites in terms of biological impact, particularly on cytokine secretion in human mononuclear cells.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as styrene and its metabolite are discussed in detail regarding their toxicological effects and biological interactions, particularly in relation to immune response, indicating a critical relationship.",
