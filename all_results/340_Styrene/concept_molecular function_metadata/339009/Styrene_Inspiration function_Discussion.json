    "context": "The concentrations were far higher than the maximum workplace concentration of 90mg/m3 (Naumann et al., 1998), the concentration in cigarette smoke (about 3mg/m3) as well as the styrene concentration in outside (1\u20133\u03bcg/m3) or indoor air (10\u201350\u03bcg/m3) (Tang et al., 2000). When taking into consideration, the short half life of styrene-7.8-oxide in solution, concentrations in our cell culture can be compared with above mentioned blood concentrations. Hence, it is possible that similar stimulating effects occur in individuals with permanent occupational exposure. From this it is to be derived that the TH1-stimulation of human immune cells found in our experiments exhibits a biological and clinical relevance regarding the inhalation of styrene or styrene-7.8-oxide for individuals working at styrene processing plants as well as heavy smokers. In normal individuals, SO blood concentrations are supposed to be far lower than the concentrations where stimulating effects in vitro arose. Therefore, it can be supplemented following the classification of styrene by the German research council (DFG; Naumann et al., 1998) that styrene is a substance with carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, along with an additional immunomodulatory capability.

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its potential effects on human immune cells and its inhalation by individuals in occupational settings, such as styrene processing plants and heavy smokers. While the text highlights the biological relevance of styrene exposure, it does not explicitly connect styrene to inspiration function or respiratory effects. The focus is more on immunomodulatory and carcinogenic properties rather than direct implications for respiratory function.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as styrene is mentioned in the context of inhalation and its effects on immune cells, but there is no detailed discussion on how it specifically impacts inspiration function.",
