    "context": "A kinetic study of catalytic incineration of styrene over a MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst was carried out in a bench scale catalytic incinerator. A differential reactor design was used for the system. Three kinetic models, the power\u2013rate law, the Mars and Van Krevelen model, and the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model were used to best fit the experimental data. The results show that the power\u2013rate law is not feasible to explain the catalytic incinerating kinetics of styrene over the MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst. The Mars and Van Krevelen model is also not feasible to explain the catalytic incinerating kinetics of styrene in this study. However, the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood model may be feasible to describe the catalytic incineration of styrene for this study. This suggests that the adsorption of either the O2 molecule or O atom is important in the process of this study. ",
