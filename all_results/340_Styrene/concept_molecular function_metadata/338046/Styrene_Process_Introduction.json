    "context": "Qin et al. have reported that for the operation of a submerged MBR for the treatment of a petrochemical wastewater, the use of HRTs in the range 13\u201319h results in effluents which have acceptable qualities. Chang et al. found negligible effect of HRT in the range 12\u201330h on the removal performance of the MBR used for treating the wastewater of an ABS unit. Visvanathan et al. report similar COD and pentachlorophenol (PCP) removal performance at HRTs in the range of 12\u201324h in an MBR used for treating a synthetic wastewater containing PCP. Decreasing HRT has also been reported to result in increase in the rate of membrane fouling in MBRs, although its effect seems to be mostly indirect than direct. The purpose of the present work is to assess the performance of an MBR process, particularly in terms of the styrene removal mechanisms and the membranes fouling at different HRTs, for treating a synthetic wastewater which contains styrene. Feed wastewater characteristics The synthetic wastewater, employed in this study, was formulated to simulate petrochemical industrial wastewater in terms of COD and styrene concentrations. For obtaining the appropriate formulation, information regarding the COD concentration of a petrochemical wastewater was obtained from the records of the treatment plant of the Tabriz Petrochemical Company in Iran, which showed a COD for the mixed effluents of the various units in the petrochemical complex in the range 700\u20131500mg/L. This amount was also in the range reported by previous investigators for petrochemical effluents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is directly related to the process of treating synthetic wastewater using a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The study focuses on assessing the performance of the MBR process specifically for styrene removal mechanisms and membrane fouling at varying hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The characteristics of the synthetic wastewater are designed to simulate petrochemical wastewater, indicating that the process is tailored to effectively manage styrene concentrations in the effluent.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between styrene and the MBR process, as the study specifically investigates styrene removal mechanisms and the impact of HRT on the process's efficiency. This relationship is supported by the context's focus on wastewater treatment performance.",
