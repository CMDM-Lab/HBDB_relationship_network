    "context": "achieved through decrease in HRT) the contribution of volatilization relative to biodegradation decreases, which suggests that theoretically similar results is expected at lower HRTs in the MBR used in the present study. Chang et al. have also reported decrease in volatilization relative to biodegradation of acrylonitrile with decreasing HRT in a MBR treating the wastewater of an ABS unit. However, in the present study due to the severe fouling developed at HRT=18h (see Section 3.2) operation at lower HRT was not conducted. Results reported by other researchers in MBR treating wastewaters containing other VOCs show that for VOCs which are more volatile and/or soluble than styrene such as acrylonitrile or vinyl acetate, the rate of volatilization at typical or \u201coptimum\u201d MBR operating conditions is not negligible but still reportedly less than 10%.Fouling of membrane during operation of the MBR system Characterization of fouling during the operation of MBR in the present study was performed through monitoring of transmembrane pressure (TMP). Fig. 4 shows the variation of TMP over more than 100 days operation of the MBR. This figure can be roughly separated into three phases: Phase 1 (day 1 to day 70), phase 2 (day 70 to day 98) and phase 3 (day 99 to day 110). The first phase corresponded to the operation of MBR at HRT of 24h followed by the initial period of operation at HRT of 18h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its volatilization and biodegradation in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system. However, there is no mention or connection to baresthesia, which refers to a loss of tactile sensation. The two terms appear in the same context but are not related in terms of function or interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between styrene and baresthesia, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect connection or relevance to each other.",
