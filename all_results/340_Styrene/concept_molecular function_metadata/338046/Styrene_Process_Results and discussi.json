    "context": "According to the paper by Hsieh, the contribution of adsorption mechanism to styrene removal from liquid phase by activated sludge is not usually very significant; therefore, it can be concluded that during the MBR process, even at HRT of 18h, the styrene removal is exclusively through biological removal. The air exiting CASPs, which are used for treatment of VOC-containing wastewaters, usually contain significant quantities of VOCs and as a result the exiting air can be considered as a pollutant of environment [2\u20134]. For example, the model for the treatment of VOC-containing wastewaters by the activated sludge process developed by Hsieh predicts that, at HRT=18h and air-to-water ratio=35, the contribution of stripping to overall removal in the case of styrene is around 15%. The results obtained in the present study suggest that a MBR process can achieve very high removal efficiencies with negligible volatilization of styrene in the exit air stream. This can be attributed to the higher MLSS that can be achieved in MBRs compared to CASPs; in the present work the MLSS achieved at HRT=18h was around 5300mg/L (Fig. 3 ), which compares with around 3400mg/L as predicted by the Hsieh model for an activated sludge process at an HRT of 18h. It should be pointed that according to the model developed by Hsieh increase in the air-to-water ratio will enhance the contribution of volatilization relative to biodegradation in the overall removal of VOCs. The air-to-water ratio employed in the present work was much higher than that normally used in CASPs, which means that in the present work almost negligible styrene volatilizations have been achieved at air-to-water ratios, which if employed in the CASP, would result in volatilization of styrene in excess of 15% in the air exit of the CASP.

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its removal during a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process. The study indicates that styrene removal is primarily biological rather than through adsorption or volatilization. The MBR process demonstrates high removal efficiencies with minimal styrene volatilization, highlighting the effectiveness of biological processes in treating VOCs like styrene in wastewater management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between styrene and the MBR process, as the study provides evidence of effective biological removal of styrene, supported by quantitative data on removal efficiencies and comparisons with other treatment methods.",
        "score": 4
