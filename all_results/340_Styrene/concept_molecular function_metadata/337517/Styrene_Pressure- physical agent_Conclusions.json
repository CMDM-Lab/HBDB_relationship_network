    "context": "For easy replacement, two desiccation tubes were installed on the biofiltration column, which could be operated in turn. Compared to a stand-alone biofilter, the integrated treatment system reliably treated fluctuating styrene loading with high removal efficiency. The separation of the gas membrane remedied the biofilter defects and strengthened the biofilter by prolonging retention time and maintaining enough styrene for the growth of styrene-degrading species when overloading occurred. Gas membrane modules can be installed in series following the biofilter, and therefore the optimum number of membrane modules and pressure differences could be selected according to the concentration of styrene from the biofilter. This novel approach to biofiltration lays a foundation for integrated control technology. Styrene is one of the most important aromatic chemicals used as raw material in the production of many commercially important products such as polystyrene, acrylonitrile\u2013butadiene\u2013styrene (ABS), styrene\u2013isoprene\u2013styrene, and styrene\u2013butadiene latexes and rubbers. The release of man-made styrene into environment can occur by various routes including the disposal of petrochemical wastewaters and pyrolysis of polystyrene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to a biofiltration system designed to treat fluctuating styrene loads effectively. The pressure differences across gas membrane modules are mentioned as a factor in optimizing the treatment process, indicating that pressure is a physical agent influencing the retention and degradation of styrene by specific microbial species. Thus, while styrene is the target compound, pressure plays a critical role in the operational efficiency of the biofiltration system.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between styrene and pressure, as the context highlights how pressure differences are crucial for optimizing the biofiltration process that treats styrene. This relationship is supported by the operational details of the system, indicating a clear interaction.",
