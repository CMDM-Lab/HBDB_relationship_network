    "context": "As the enriched styrene was recharged back into the biofiltration column, the concentration of untreated styrene was maintained in a certain range, which supported a certain amount of styrene-degraders. Acetic acid and other intermediate products may have accumulated in the biofilter, especially when it was overloaded (Berger and Peters, 1999; Devinny and Hodge, 1995; Devinny et al., 1999a). When intermediate degrading species increased, the total species were obviously enhanced. Multiple metabolic steps are required to transform styrene to carbon dioxide and water, and different species may specialize in different parts of the process. C. tropicalis, Pseudomonas genera, A. niger, and P. frequentans were the four dominant styrene-degraders found in the biofiltration column. However, their relative abundances were different in individual stages. Large numbers of eubacteria, yeast and fungi were detected after inoculation, with Pseudomonas genera and C. tropicalis dominating P. frequentans. ",

        "summary": "In this context, styrene is directly related to the process of biodegradation within a biofiltration column. The study discusses how styrene is recharged into the system, maintaining a concentration that supports styrene-degrading microorganisms. The process involves multiple metabolic steps to convert styrene into carbon dioxide and water, with specific microbial species specializing in different stages of degradation. This highlights the critical role of the biodegradation process in managing styrene levels and the importance of microbial diversity in effectively carrying out this process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between styrene and the biodegradation process, supported by evidence of microbial activity and metabolic pathways involved in transforming styrene. The context provides a clear understanding of how the process is essential for styrene degradation.",
