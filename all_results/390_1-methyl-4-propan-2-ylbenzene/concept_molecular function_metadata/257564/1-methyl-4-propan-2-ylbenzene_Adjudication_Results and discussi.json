    "context": "The \u03bcGC applicability was verified by comparing the data recorded for 1 h interval with those obtained by the GC/MS analysis of two air samples, drawn out in the same time interval using the Nalophan bags. The compounds identification was possible by comparing retention times with those of standards. The peak areas trend vs time obtained for all the identified compounds is shown in Fig. 4 . For the most abundant ones, limonene, toluene, p-cymene, \u03b1-pinene, and xylenes, a quantitative determination was carried out to estimate their concentrations. In Fig. 5 a typical ambient air chromatogram is shown. In case of the \u03bcGC the detection limit was estimated for the identified compounds and resulted as low as 1\u20132 ppb. Table 5 reports the comparison of the concentration values obtained by the two systems. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene (also known as isobutylbenzene) is mentioned in relation to the analysis of air samples using \u03bcGC and GC/MS methods. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding 'Adjudication' in relation to this compound. The term 'Adjudication' does not appear to have any relevance to the chemical analysis or the compounds being studied, indicating a lack of relationship between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and Adjudication are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion or connection between them, indicating they are unrelated.",
