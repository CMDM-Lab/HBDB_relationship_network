    "context": "The software employed was SCAN for Windows (Minitab. Inc., PA, USA). Emission characterisation Fig. 1 shows the total ion chromatogram acquired over the range m/z 41\u2013200 for a solution of 13 standards chosen as representative of VOC emissions from MSW. The chosen temperature program allowed the separation of a lot of peaks; moreover, the abundant monoterpene, limonene, was well resolved from the very close molecular weight p-cymene, generally present at low concentrations in the odour emissions from a MSW landfill. Samples coming from the most representative emission-sources in a MSW landfill were collected in three different periods of the year, and precisely, in February, May and November. For reasons of simplicity only the data relative to the month of May are reported in Table 1 . As to the emissions from the landfill, they were similar in the different sampling campaigns, whereas significative differences were observed in the ambient air in the vicinity of the landfill, due to different weather conditions.

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene (also known as p-cymene) is mentioned alongside monoterpenes, specifically limonene, as part of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. While both compounds are categorized as VOCs and share similar molecular weight characteristics, the context does not provide a detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships, indicating a general association rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and monoterpenes are mentioned in the same context related to VOC emissions, but their relationship lacks depth and specificity beyond their classification as VOCs.",
