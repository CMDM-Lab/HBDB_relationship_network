    "context": "PCA analysis allowed us to evaluate similarities and dissimilarities within the data resulting from the emissions and ambient air. Fig. 2 reports the biplot, obtained using only the compounds present in the air samples at high concentration, which points out if there is a relationship between emissions and ambient air, and if a VOC can be considered as a marker of a particular sample. As can be easily seen, odorants present in all ambient air samples collected in the environment surrounding the landfill seem to be imputed to the landfill itself and not to a malfunction of the scrubber. Moreover, it is possible to identify groups of samples having similar features, such as old refusals, biogas and leachate whose typical markers are p-cymene, eucalyptol, camphor, \u03b1-terpinene, hexanal and 1,2-dichloro ethylene. This group seems to be responsible of the characteristics of the ambient air at the entrance of the landfill. A second group is formed by ambient air samples collected at increasing distance from the landfill which is less affected by the emissions, but is characterised by the odorous compounds typical of both fresh and old types of wastes. The markers for these samples can be considered limonene, ethyl acetate and some aromatic compounds, probably because of the proximity of road traffic. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and n-hexanal are both mentioned as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in air samples around a landfill. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships. They are part of a broader analysis of odorants and markers associated with different waste types, but their individual roles or connections are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and n-hexanal are simply listed among other VOCs without any detailed interaction or functional relationship discussed in the context.",
