    "context": "Recovered fines samples from a total of 14 C&D waste recycling facilities in Florida were collected over a period of 18 months and then analyzed for organic pollutants (volatile and semi-volatile organics). Both total extractable organic analysis and leaching analysis were conducted to chemically characterize the recovered soil fines. For leaching analysis a synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP) test was performed to evaluate the leachability of organics. Only a few volatile organic compounds (VOCs) out of 50 target VOCs, including trichlorofluoromethane, toluene, 4-isopropyltoluene, trimethylbenzene, xylenes, and methylene chloride, were commonly found in the samples. Among the commonly leached compounds were ethylbenzene, trimethylbenzene, toluene, xylenes, and trichlorofluoromethane. Toluene showed the highest leachability among the compounds (61.3\u201392.0%), while trichlorofluoromethane, the most commonly detected compound from both total and leaching tests, resulted in the lowest leachability (1.4\u201339.9%).

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene (also known as 4-isopropyltoluene) and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in soil samples from construction and demolition waste recycling facilities. They are mentioned together in the context of leachability tests, where toluene is noted for its high leachability compared to other compounds. However, the specific relationship between 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as VOCs present in the samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and toluene, as they are both VOCs found in the same environmental study. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other beyond their shared classification.",
