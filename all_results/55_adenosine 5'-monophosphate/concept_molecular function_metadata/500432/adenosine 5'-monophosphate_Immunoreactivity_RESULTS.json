[1] Immunoreactivity of adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5/6 was observed in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. [2] T84 cells were fixed in methanol and stained for AC5/6 immunoreactivity. [3] Cells were counterstained with haematoxylin. [4] A red colour was indicative of positive staining for adenylate cyclase. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to immunoreactivity through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5/6 in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. The immunoreactivity observed indicates the presence of these isoforms, which are involved in the signaling pathways that AMP participates in. However, the specific role of AMP in relation to the immunoreactivity of AC5/6 is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between adenosine 5'-monophosphate and immunoreactivity, as both are mentioned in the context of adenylate cyclase isoforms. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or direct interaction.",
