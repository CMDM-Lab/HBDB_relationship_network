[1] Due to the lack of availability of agonists and antagonists selective for the different adenylate cyclase isoforms, we took advantage of recent reports which showed that AC5 and 6 can be differentiated functionally from other isoforms based on the fact that their activities are reduced by both PKA activation and increases in intracellular calcium. [2] 8-Br-cAMP was added as an activator of PKA and carbachol was used to increase intracellular calcium. [3] There was a significant decrease in the Isc response to forskolin when tissues were costimulated with 10 \u00ce\u00bcM forskolin and either 10 \u00ce\u00bcM 8-Br-cAMP or 10 \u00ce\u00bcM carbachol, compared with the Isc response elicited by forskolin alone (p<0.05) (fig 6). [4] At the concentrations used, both 8-Br-cAMP and carbachol caused only modest changes in Isc when added on their own (data not shown). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to antagonists through the discussion of adenylate cyclase isoforms and their modulation by various compounds. While antagonists are mentioned in the context of differentiating the functional activities of adenylate cyclase isoforms, there is no direct interaction or specific role of AMP as an antagonist or in relation to antagonists. The focus is more on the effects of agonists and the modulation of adenylate cyclase activity rather than a clear relationship with antagonists.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is part of the broader discussion on adenylate cyclase modulation, but there is no detailed relationship or interaction with antagonists provided in the context.",
        "score": 2
