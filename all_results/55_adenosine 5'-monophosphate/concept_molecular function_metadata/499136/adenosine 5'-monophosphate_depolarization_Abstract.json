    "context": "[3] In particular, direct evidence for Ca2+-regulated cAMP production in living cells is incomplete. [4] Genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors have made possible real-time imaging of spatial and temporal gradients of intracellular cAMP concentration in single living cells. [5] Here, we used confocal microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and insulin-secreting MIN6 cells expressing Epac1-camps, a biosynthetic unimolecular cAMP indicator, to better understand the role of intracellular Ca2+ in cAMP production. [6] We report that depolarization with high external K+, tolbutamide, or glucose caused a rapid increase in cAMP that was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by nitrendipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, or 2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2,5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-dideoxyadenosine, a P-site antagonist of transmembrane adenylate cyclases. [7] Stimulation of MIN6 cells with glucose in the presence of tetraethylammonium chloride generated concomitant Ca2+ and cAMP oscillations that were abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and blocked by 2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2,5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-dideoxyadenosine or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. [8] Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ and cAMP concentrations with Fura-2 and Epac1-camps, respectively, revealed a close temporal and causal interrelationship between the increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cAMP levels following membrane depolarization. [9] These findings indicate highly coordinated interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in electrically excitable endocrine cells and suggest that Ca2+-dependent cAMP oscillations are derived from an increase in adenylate cyclase activity and periodic activation and inactivation of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to depolarization through its role in cAMP signaling. The study shows that depolarization of insulin-secreting MIN6 cells leads to a rapid increase in cAMP levels, which is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. This suggests that AMP, as a precursor to cAMP, is involved in the signaling pathway activated by depolarization, highlighting a coordinated interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in these cells.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between adenosine 5'-monophosphate and depolarization, as the context provides evidence of how depolarization influences cAMP production, which is derived from AMP. The relationship is supported by experimental findings demonstrating the dependence on Ca2+ and the role of adenylate cyclase.",
