    "context": "[8] Reconstitution of extracellular Ca2+ following intracellular Ca2+ store depletion by carbachol stimulation in Ca2+-free solutions increased cAMP production (data not shown), suggesting a role of Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels in mediating cAMP signaling in MIN6 cells. [9] Our data indicate that secretagogue-induced elevation of cAMP concentration is a Ca2+-dependent signaling event requiring the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and suggest that mobilization of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores plays a limited role in cAMP production. [1] Effect of secretagogues on cAMP formation. [2] A-C, effects of 20 mm KCl, 100 \u00ce\u00bcm tolbutamide (TB), and 20 mm glucose, respectively, on cAMP accumulation in the presence (blue lines) and absence (green lines) of 50 \u00ce\u00bcm DDA, an inhibitor of membrane-bound adenylate cyclases. [3] Cells were exposed to DDA 2-5 min prior to application of secretagogues. [4] D, comparison of dynamic cAMP production following stimulation with secretagogues.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors, specifically the DDA inhibitor of membrane-bound adenylate cyclases. The study discusses how secretagogue-induced cAMP production is influenced by calcium signaling and the presence of inhibitors like DDA, which affects the accumulation of cAMP in MIN6 cells. While AMP is a product of adenylate cyclase activity, the focus is on the role of inhibitors in modulating cAMP levels rather than a direct relationship between AMP and the inhibitors themselves.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is part of the cAMP signaling pathway influenced by inhibitors, but the context does not provide a detailed interaction between AMP and the inhibitors themselves.",
        "score": 3
