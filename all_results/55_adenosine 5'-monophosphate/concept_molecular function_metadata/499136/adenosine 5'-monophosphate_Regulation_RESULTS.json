[9] Statistical significance of comparisons with control responses is depicted. [10] ***, p < 0.001. [1] Expression of Adenylate Cyclase and Phosphodiesterase Isoforms in MIN6 Cells\u00e2\u20ac\u201dTo identify the AC and PDE isoforms involved in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent cAMP signals in MIN6 \u00ce\u00b2-cells, we used reverse transcription-PCR. [2] We detected transcripts for Ca2+-activated AC-I and AC-VIII isoforms as well as AC-IV-VII and AC-IX (see supplemental Fig. S1). [3] A member of the Ca2+-activated PDE1 family, PDE1C, was also expressed in MIN6 cells along with several other PDE isoforms, including PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE7B, and PDE10A (see supplemental Fig. S1). [1] The plasticity and diversity of cellular signals elicited by extracellular stimuli are determined by information encoded in specific patterns of spatial and temporal changes in Ca2+ and cAMP concentrations.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to regulation through its involvement in the signaling pathways of MIN6 \u03b2-cells. The study focuses on the expression of adenylate cyclase (AC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms that modulate cAMP levels, which are crucial for cellular responses to stimuli. While AMP itself is not explicitly discussed, its role as a signaling molecule in regulating cAMP concentrations is implied, highlighting its importance in the broader regulatory mechanisms of cellular signaling.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is part of the signaling pathways being studied, but its specific regulatory role is not detailed. The context discusses regulation in terms of cAMP signaling, which AMP influences, indicating a connection but lacking direct evidence.",
