    "context": "[2] Levorphanol, a full agonist, induced lower AC superactivation than other full agonists and reduced the effects of U50,488H and dynorphin A(1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17) on AC superactivation. [3] For the human and rat \u00ce\u00ba opioid receptors, the relative efficacies of different agonists in causing AC superactivation were similar and the degrees of AC superactivation after an agonist pretreatment were slightly lower for the rkor than for the hkor. [4] Because the human, but not the rat, \u00ce\u00ba opioid receptor undergoes agonist-induced regulation and agonists induce AC superactivation regardless of their abilities to promote internalization, these results indicate that the extents of AC superactivation are not significantly affected by these regulatory processes. [1] Calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases provide a key regulatory device for integrating the activities of the two major signalling systems, Ca2+ and cAMP. [2] Recent experiments have brought us closer to understanding the molecular mechanisms whereby Ca2+ either stimulates or inhibits susceptible adenylate cyclases in vitro. [3] However, in the intact cell an additional layer of sophistication is evident whereby Ca2+-sensitive adenylate cyclases are juxtaposed with Ca2+-entry channels, such that the cyclases respond selectively to capacitative Ca2+ entry. [4] Part of this dependency is enforced by the placement of Ca2+-sensitive adenylate cyclases (AC5, AC6 and AC8) in caveolae, from which at least one Ca2+-insensitive adenylate cyclase (AC7) is excluded.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to signal transduction through its role in the activation of adenylate cyclases, which are key enzymes in the cAMP signaling pathway. The discussion highlights how calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases integrate signals from calcium and cAMP, indicating that AMP is a crucial component in the broader context of signal transduction mechanisms involving these pathways. However, the specific interactions of AMP with signal transduction processes are not elaborated in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is involved in the signaling pathways discussed, particularly through its role in activating adenylate cyclases, which are essential for signal transduction. However, the relationship is not deeply explored.",
