    "context": " [5] Changes in perfusion pressure were measured with a pressure transducer approximately 15 cm from the tip of the cannula.  [6] The preparation was allowed to equilibrate for 30 to 45 min, and its viability was checked by a bolus injection of 6 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20195 mol of KCl.  [7] Then the preparation was perfused with noradrenaline (3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196M), which induced a sustained increase in perfusion pressure, and a concentration-response curve was constructed by perfusing with increasing concentrations (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20197\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20195 M) of the flavonoids.  [8] In some experiments, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M), the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M], KCl (40 mM, with isotonic replacement by NaCl), or the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 M) was present in the noradrenaline-solution.  [9] In another group of preparations, endothelium removal was attained by perfusing with sodium deoxycholate (0.3% in distilled water) for 30 s , and then the preparation was allowed to equilibrate for another 30 min. [10] The functional endothelium removal procedure was verified by the lack of relaxant effect of a bolus of acetylcholine (10 nmol). [1] Iliac arteries were permeabilized by treatment with the detergent \u00ce\u00b2-escin, allowing Ca2+ to diffuse freely through the membrane so that the intracellular Ca2+ could be controlled by modifying its extracellular concentration .

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors through the mention of various inhibitors affecting different pathways, including adenylate cyclase. The study involves the use of inhibitors like SQ22536, which targets adenylate cyclase, potentially influencing AMP levels and signaling pathways. However, the specific role of AMP in relation to these inhibitors is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is mentioned in the context of inhibitors affecting adenylate cyclase, suggesting a potential interaction. However, the lack of detailed discussion on AMP's specific role limits the strength of their relationship.",
