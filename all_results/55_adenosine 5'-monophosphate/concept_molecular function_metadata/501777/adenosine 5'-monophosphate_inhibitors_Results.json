    "context": "[1] Endothelial independence of quercetin- and isorhamnetin-induced relaxation in thoracic aorta (A) and perfused mesenteric bed (B). [2] +E and \u00e2\u02c6\u2019E indicate endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded arteries, respectively. [3] Values are expressed as means \u00c2\u00b1 S.E.M. (n = 5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7). [1] The increase in perfusion pressure induced by noradrenaline in the presence of the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M), the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M), KCl (40 mM), or the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 M) was not significantly different from that induced by noradrenaline alone (Table 2). [2] None of these treatments had any significant effect on the relaxant effects of quercetin or isorhamnetin (Fig. 5, Table2). [3] Addition of PMA (3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20197 M) to resting preparations induced a slowly developing increase in perfusion pressure, which reached a plateau within 1 h and was not different from that induced by noradrenaline (P > 0.05). [4] The relaxant effects of quercetin were similar in PMA-stimulated compared with noradrenaline-stimulated mesenteric beds, whereas isorhamnetin-induced vasodilation was less potent (P < 0.05) in PMA-stimulated mesenteric beds (Table 2).

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors as the study discusses the effects of various inhibitors on vascular responses. Specifically, the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 is mentioned, which would affect AMP levels by inhibiting its production from ATP. However, the context does not elaborate on the direct relationship between AMP and the inhibitors, focusing instead on their effects on vascular relaxation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is mentioned in relation to an inhibitor (SQ22536) that affects its production, but the context does not provide a detailed discussion of their interaction or significance.",
        "score": 2
