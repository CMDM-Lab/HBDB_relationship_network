    "context": "[5] The relaxation induced by quercetin and other related flavonoids was endothelium-independent (; ) or very weakly (less than 2-fold shift) inhibited by endothelial removal . [6] In the present paper, we found that the vasodilator effects of quercetin and its main metabolite isorhamnetin are endothelium-independent, not only in the rat aorta, but also in the mesenteric resistance vascular bed. [7] However, these results do not exclude an effect of quercetin on endothelial function because after administration for 5 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive rats, quercetin restored endothelium-dependent relaxation . [1] A possible role of cyclic nucleotides in flavonoid-induced vasodilation was tested using ODQ and SQ22536, selective inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase, respectively. [2] High KCl was used as a classic pharmacological maneuver to inhibit K+ channel-dependent hyperpolarization, and ouabain was used as an inhibitor of the Na+/K+ ATPase. [3] None of these treatments had any effect on isorhamnetin-induced vasodilatation in the mesenteric bed excluding these signaling pathways as potential mechanisms of action. [4] In addition, the absence of effect of the nonselective K+ channel blockers, tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine, and the KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide on quercetin-induced relaxation in isolated intact aortae and iliac arteries confirmed that K+ channels were not involved.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors through the discussion of cyclic nucleotides and their role in vasodilation. The study mentions selective inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase, which are involved in the signaling pathways that could affect AMP levels. However, the specific relationship between AMP and the inhibitors is not directly explored, indicating a more general connection rather than a detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is mentioned in the context of signaling pathways affected by inhibitors, but there is no direct discussion of how these inhibitors specifically interact with AMP.",
