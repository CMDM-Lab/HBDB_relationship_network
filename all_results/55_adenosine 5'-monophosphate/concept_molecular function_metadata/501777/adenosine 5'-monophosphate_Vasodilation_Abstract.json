    "context": "[2] In the present study, the effects of quercetin and its metabolites were analyzed on isometric tension in isolated rat thoracic and abdominal aorta, in isolated intact and \u00ce\u00b2-escin-permeabilized iliac arteries, and on perfusion pressure in the isolated mesenteric resistance vascular bed. [3] In noradrenaline-precontracted vessels, the four flavonoids produced a vasodilator effect, which was inversely correlated with the diameter of the vessel studied; i.e., quercetin, isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol were 5-, 25-, 4-, and 6-fold, respectively, more potent in the resistance mesenteric bed (\u00e2\u02c6\u2019log IC50 = 5.35 \u00c2\u00b1 0.15, 5.89 \u00c2\u00b1 0.11, 5.34 \u00c2\u00b1 0.10, and 5.66 \u00c2\u00b1 0.06, respectively) than in the thoracic aorta (\u00e2\u02c6\u2019log IC50 = 4.68 \u00c2\u00b1 0.08, 4.61 \u00c2\u00b1 0.08, 4.73 \u00c2\u00b1 0.11, and 4.81 \u00c2\u00b1 0.13, respectively;n = 4\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6). [4] The vasodilator responses of quercetin and isorhamnetin were not significantly modified after removal of the endothelium in the thoracic aorta or in the mesenteric bed. [5] Furthermore, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M), the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M], KCl (40 mM), or ouabain (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 M) had no effect on isorhamnetin-induced vasodilation in the mesenteric bed. [6] In permeabilized iliac arteries stimulated with Ca2+(pCa of 5.9), isorhamnetin was also significantly more potent (\u00e2\u02c6\u2019log IC50 = 5.27 \u00c2\u00b1 0.15) than quercetin (\u00e2\u02c6\u2019log IC50 = 4.56 \u00c2\u00b1 0.15). [7] In conclusion, quercetin and its metabolites showed vasodilator effects with selectivity toward the resistance vessels. [8] These effects are not due to or modulated by endothelial factors and are unrelated to changes in cytosolic Ca2+. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not explicitly mentioned, but the study focuses on the vasodilatory effects of quercetin and its metabolites on isolated vascular tissues. Vasodilation is a key physiological response that can be influenced by various signaling molecules, including AMP, which is known to play a role in vascular smooth muscle relaxation. However, the direct relationship between AMP and vasodilation is not detailed in the provided context, limiting the clarity of their connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as AMP is a known modulator of vasodilation, but the context does not provide specific evidence or discussion linking AMP directly to the observed vasodilatory effects of quercetin and its metabolites.",
