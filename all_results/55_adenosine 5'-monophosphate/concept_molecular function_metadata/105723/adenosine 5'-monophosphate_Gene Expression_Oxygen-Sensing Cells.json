    "context": "[8] In many of the studies based on PC12 cell responses to hypoxia, the cells remain viable and continue to proliferate during and following periods of prolonged hypoxia (1% O2 for 24 to 48 hours). [9] Thus, the PC12 cell line is a useful system in which to study the molecular and cellular basis of O2 chemosensitivity and the mechanisms by which O2-responsive genes are regulated by hypoxia. [1] We have used the excitable PC12 cells to identify a number of signaling pathways that regulate gene expression during hypoxia. [2] These include the 3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A pathway , the Ca2+-calmodulin pathway , the ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway , the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, also known as p38 kinase) pathway , and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt  pathway as regulators of gene expression. [3] Although the responses of different cell types will probably vary (especially between excitable and nonexcitable cells), it is likely that there will be a core set of responses to hypoxia that is common to all cells.  [1] The immediate response of PC12 cells exposed to hypoxia is membrane depolarization and increased [Ca2+]i , which is similar to the response measured in carotid body type I cells .  [2] Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments revealed that this membrane depolarization in PC12 cells is mediated by an O2-sensitive potassium channel . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is implicated in the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia in PC12 cells. The cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, which involves AMP, is one of several signaling pathways identified as regulators of gene expression under low oxygen conditions. This suggests that AMP plays a significant role in the cellular response to hypoxia by influencing gene expression mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between adenosine 5'-monophosphate and gene expression, as AMP is part of a key signaling pathway that regulates gene expression during hypoxia, supported by the context's detailed discussion of cellular responses.",
