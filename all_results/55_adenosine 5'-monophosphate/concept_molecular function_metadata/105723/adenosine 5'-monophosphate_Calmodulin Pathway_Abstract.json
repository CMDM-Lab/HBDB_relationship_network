    "context": "[5] Oxygen-sensing cells can be segregated into two distinct cell types: those that functionally depolarize (excitable) and those that do not functionally depolarize (nonexcitable) in response to reduced oxygen. [6] Theoretically, excitable cells have all the same signaling capabilities as the nonexcitable cells, but the nonexcitable cells cannot have all the signaling capabilities as excitable cells. [7] A number of signaling pathways have been identified that regulate gene expression during hypoxia. [8] These include the Ca2+-calmodulin pathway, the 3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase [(MAPK); also known as the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) for ERK1 and ERK2] pathway, the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK; also known as p38 kinase) pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. [9] In this review, we describe hypoxia-induced signaling in the model O2-sensing rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line, the current level of understanding of the major signaling events that are activated by reduced O2, and how these signaling events lead to altered gene expression in both excitable and nonexcitable oxygen-sensing cells. [1] Mammalian cells require a constant supply of oxygen to maintain adequate energy production, which is essential for maintaining normal function and for ensuring cell survival. [2] Even brief episodes of hypoxia can result in cessation of oxidative phosphorylation and depletion of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which results in profound deficiencies in cellular function.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to the Calmodulin pathway through its involvement in cellular signaling during hypoxia. The Calmodulin pathway is one of several signaling pathways mentioned that regulate gene expression in response to reduced oxygen levels. While AMP is part of the broader signaling landscape, the specific interaction between AMP and the Calmodulin pathway is not detailed, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between adenosine 5'-monophosphate and the Calmodulin pathway, as both are involved in cellular signaling during hypoxia but lack a detailed discussion of their specific interaction.",
