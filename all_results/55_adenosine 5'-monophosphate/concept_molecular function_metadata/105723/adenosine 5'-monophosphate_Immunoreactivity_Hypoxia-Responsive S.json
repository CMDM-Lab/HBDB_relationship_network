    "context": " [3] Calcium imaging studies using fura-2 revealed that anoxia (100% N2) produced a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i and that this rise was attenuated by ADO.  [4] Pre-exposure to chronic hypoxia (10% O2 for 24 or 48 hours) enhanced the subsequent anoxia-induced rise in [Ca2+]i.  [5] In contrast, pre-exposure to chronic hypoxia blunted the inhibitory effects of ADO on both ICa and on the anoxia-induced increase in [Ca2+]i.. Northern blot analysis and radioligand binding with [3H]CGS21680, a selective A2A receptor ligand, showed that the A2A receptor levels were increased by chronic hypoxia.  [6] Chronic hypoxia did not alter the immunoreactivity levels of G\u00ce\u00b1s or activity of adenylate cyclase.  [7] However, PKA enzyme activity was significantly inhibited when PC12 cells were exposed to 10% O2 for 24 or 48 hours.  [8] This suggests that reduced activity of PKA is the primary mechanism by which the actions of adenosine on ICa and [Ca2+]i are attenuated by chronic hypoxia in PC12 cells.  [9] This mechanism may also serve to limit negative feedback on ICa and [Ca2+]i by adenosine and therefore maintain enhanced membrane excitability of PC12 cells during long-term hypoxia. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (ADO) is implicated in the modulation of intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) in PC12 cells under conditions of chronic hypoxia. The study indicates that chronic hypoxia affects the immunoreactivity of A2A receptors, which are linked to ADO's signaling pathways. However, the specific relationship between ADO and immunoreactivity is not deeply explored, focusing instead on the effects of ADO on calcium dynamics and PKA activity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ADO's role in calcium signaling and its interaction with A2A receptors suggests a connection to immunoreactivity, but the context does not provide extensive details on their direct relationship.",
