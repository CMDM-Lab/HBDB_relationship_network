    "context": "[5] The relaxation induced by quercetin and other related flavonoids was endothelium-independent (; ) or very weakly (less than 2-fold shift) inhibited by endothelial removal . [6] In the present paper, we found that the vasodilator effects of quercetin and its main metabolite isorhamnetin are endothelium-independent, not only in the rat aorta, but also in the mesenteric resistance vascular bed. [7] However, these results do not exclude an effect of quercetin on endothelial function because after administration for 5 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive rats, quercetin restored endothelium-dependent relaxation . [1] A possible role of cyclic nucleotides in flavonoid-induced vasodilation was tested using ODQ and SQ22536, selective inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase, respectively. [2] High KCl was used as a classic pharmacological maneuver to inhibit K+ channel-dependent hyperpolarization, and ouabain was used as an inhibitor of the Na+/K+ ATPase. [3] None of these treatments had any effect on isorhamnetin-induced vasodilatation in the mesenteric bed excluding these signaling pathways as potential mechanisms of action. [4] In addition, the absence of effect of the nonselective K+ channel blockers, tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine, and the KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide on quercetin-induced relaxation in isolated intact aortae and iliac arteries confirmed that K+ channels were not involved.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to flavonoids, particularly quercetin and isorhamnetin, through their effects on vascular relaxation. The study investigates the mechanisms of flavonoid-induced vasodilation, suggesting that cyclic nucleotides, including AMP, may play a role. However, the specific relationship between AMP and flavonoids is not deeply explored, indicating a moderate connection rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is mentioned in the context of flavonoid-induced vasodilation, but the relationship is not extensively detailed, indicating some interaction but lacking strong evidence.",
