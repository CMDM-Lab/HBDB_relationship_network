    "context": " [5] Changes in perfusion pressure were measured with a pressure transducer approximately 15 cm from the tip of the cannula.  [6] The preparation was allowed to equilibrate for 30 to 45 min, and its viability was checked by a bolus injection of 6 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20195 mol of KCl.  [7] Then the preparation was perfused with noradrenaline (3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196M), which induced a sustained increase in perfusion pressure, and a concentration-response curve was constructed by perfusing with increasing concentrations (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20197\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20195 M) of the flavonoids.  [8] In some experiments, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M), the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M], KCl (40 mM, with isotonic replacement by NaCl), or the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 M) was present in the noradrenaline-solution.  [9] In another group of preparations, endothelium removal was attained by perfusing with sodium deoxycholate (0.3% in distilled water) for 30 s , and then the preparation was allowed to equilibrate for another 30 min. [10] The functional endothelium removal procedure was verified by the lack of relaxant effect of a bolus of acetylcholine (10 nmol). [1] Iliac arteries were permeabilized by treatment with the detergent \u00ce\u00b2-escin, allowing Ca2+ to diffuse freely through the membrane so that the intracellular Ca2+ could be controlled by modifying its extracellular concentration .

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and amines are mentioned in relation to physiological experiments involving perfusion pressure and various inhibitors. However, there is no direct discussion of how AMP interacts with amines or their specific roles in the experimental setup. The focus is primarily on the effects of noradrenaline and other compounds on perfusion pressure, with AMP and amines appearing without a clear relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between adenosine 5'-monophosphate and amines, as they are mentioned in the context but without any direct interaction or relevance to each other in the described experiments.",
