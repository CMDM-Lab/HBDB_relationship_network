    "context": "[2] Panel A shows a typical recording obtained with quercetin, and panel B shows the averaged values for the two drugs (means \u00c2\u00b1 S.E.M.,n = 6\u00e2\u20ac\u201c9). [3] \u00e2\u02c6\u2014, P < 0.05, isorhamnetin versus quercetin. [1] Previous reports have shown that quercetin exhibits vasodilator effects in isolated rat aorta . [2] In the present study we report for the first time that 1) the metabolites of quercetin, isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol, also induced vascular smooth muscle relaxation with potency similar to or higher than that of the parent compound; 2) the relaxant effects of quercetin and its metabolites were markedly augmented in resistance compared with conductance arteries; 3) the effects of isorhamnetin, the most potent and long-lasting metabolite in plasma, were endothelium-independent and were not modified by inhibition of guanylate cyclase, adenylate cyclase, or Na+/K+ ATPase, or by increasing the extracellular concentration of KCl; and 4) isorhamnetin showed a similar vasodilator potency in permeabilized iliac arteries at constant [Ca2+] and in intact artery preparations. [1] Resistance arteries are responsible for regulation of arterial pressure and local blood flow. [2] Quercetin and its metabolites were more potent in the mesenteric resistance vascular bed than in conductance arteries, and, in fact, an inverse correlation was found between the potency of the flavonoid and the internal diameter of the vessel studied. [3] Selectivity for resistance arteries is also a typical feature of Ca2+ channel blockers and K+ channel openers , whereas nitrates are more potent in large than in small arteries. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the metabolites of quercetin, such as isorhamnetin, which exhibit vasodilator effects. These metabolites are derived from quercetin, indicating a relationship where AMP may play a role in the metabolic pathways of these compounds. However, the specific connection between AMP and the metabolites is not explicitly detailed, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as adenosine 5'-monophosphate is not directly discussed in relation to the metabolites of quercetin. While both are part of metabolic processes, their specific interactions or relevance in the context are not elaborated upon.",
