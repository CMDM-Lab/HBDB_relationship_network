    "context": " [5] Changes in perfusion pressure were measured with a pressure transducer approximately 15 cm from the tip of the cannula.  [6] The preparation was allowed to equilibrate for 30 to 45 min, and its viability was checked by a bolus injection of 6 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20195 mol of KCl.  [7] Then the preparation was perfused with noradrenaline (3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196M), which induced a sustained increase in perfusion pressure, and a concentration-response curve was constructed by perfusing with increasing concentrations (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20197\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20195 M) of the flavonoids.  [8] In some experiments, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M), the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2-furanyl)-9H-purin-6-amine; 10\u00e2\u02c6\u20196 M], KCl (40 mM, with isotonic replacement by NaCl), or the Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor ouabain (10\u00e2\u02c6\u20193 M) was present in the noradrenaline-solution.  [9] In another group of preparations, endothelium removal was attained by perfusing with sodium deoxycholate (0.3% in distilled water) for 30 s , and then the preparation was allowed to equilibrate for another 30 min. [10] The functional endothelium removal procedure was verified by the lack of relaxant effect of a bolus of acetylcholine (10 nmol). [1] Iliac arteries were permeabilized by treatment with the detergent \u00ce\u00b2-escin, allowing Ca2+ to diffuse freely through the membrane so that the intracellular Ca2+ could be controlled by modifying its extracellular concentration .

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and quinoxaline are mentioned in relation to their roles in cellular signaling pathways. Quinoxaline, specifically the compound 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), is used as a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, which may influence the signaling pathways involving AMP. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or detailed relationship between AMP and quinoxaline beyond their involvement in the same experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in signaling pathways but lack a detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships in the context provided.",
