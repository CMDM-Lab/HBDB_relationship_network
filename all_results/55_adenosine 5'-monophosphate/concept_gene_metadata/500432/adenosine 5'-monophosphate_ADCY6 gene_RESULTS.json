[1] Immunoreactivity of adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5/6 was observed in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. [2] T84 cells were fixed in methanol and stained for AC5/6 immunoreactivity. [3] Cells were counterstained with haematoxylin. [4] A red colour was indicative of positive staining for adenylate cyclase. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to the ADCY6 gene through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5/6, which are involved in the conversion of AMP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The immunoreactivity of AC5/6 in human intestinal epithelial cells suggests a functional role in cellular signaling pathways that may be influenced by the ADCY6 gene, although the specific relationship between AMP and ADCY6 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses adenylate cyclase isoforms related to AMP metabolism and their immunoreactivity, indicating a connection to the ADCY6 gene, but lacks detailed exploration of their direct interaction.",
