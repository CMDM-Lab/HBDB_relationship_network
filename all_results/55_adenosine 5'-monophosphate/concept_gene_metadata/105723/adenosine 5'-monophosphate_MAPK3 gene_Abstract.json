    "context": "[5] Oxygen-sensing cells can be segregated into two distinct cell types: those that functionally depolarize (excitable) and those that do not functionally depolarize (nonexcitable) in response to reduced oxygen. [6] Theoretically, excitable cells have all the same signaling capabilities as the nonexcitable cells, but the nonexcitable cells cannot have all the signaling capabilities as excitable cells. [7] A number of signaling pathways have been identified that regulate gene expression during hypoxia. [8] These include the Ca2+-calmodulin pathway, the 3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase [(MAPK); also known as the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) for ERK1 and ERK2] pathway, the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK; also known as p38 kinase) pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. [9] In this review, we describe hypoxia-induced signaling in the model O2-sensing rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line, the current level of understanding of the major signaling events that are activated by reduced O2, and how these signaling events lead to altered gene expression in both excitable and nonexcitable oxygen-sensing cells. [1] Mammalian cells require a constant supply of oxygen to maintain adequate energy production, which is essential for maintaining normal function and for ensuring cell survival. [2] Even brief episodes of hypoxia can result in cessation of oxidative phosphorylation and depletion of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which results in profound deficiencies in cellular function.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is part of the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression during hypoxia, which includes the MAPK3 gene pathway. The MAPK pathway, specifically p42 and p44 MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2), is activated in response to hypoxic conditions, suggesting that AMP may play a role in modulating this signaling pathway and influencing the expression of genes regulated by MAPK3 during oxygen deprivation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between adenosine 5'-monophosphate and the MAPK3 gene, as both are involved in the same hypoxia-induced signaling pathways, indicating a clear relationship supported by the context.",
