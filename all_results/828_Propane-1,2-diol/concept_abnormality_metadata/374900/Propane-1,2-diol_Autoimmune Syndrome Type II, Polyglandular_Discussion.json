    "context": "Also, the use of different inoculant types may partially explain alterations in fermentation patterns. In our farm survey, corn silage solely treated with heterofermentative LAB containing Lactobacillus buchneri had the highest acetic acid concentration, but this inoculant type was not tested in our ensiling experiments. Our observation that all farm silages contained 1,2-propanediol, which was not measured in the ensiling experiments, is likely attributable to the presence of epiphytic Lactobacillus buchneri on the crop at harvest and its activity during the fermentation process. This species, whose presence varies with location (Schmidt and Kung, 2010), is the only known 1,2-propanediol producer in silage converting lactate into acetate and this compound (Oude-Elferink et al., 2001). In our study, n-propanol was detected less frequently and at lower concentrations compared with previous investigations, which reported up to 19.1g/kg of DM (Kala\u010d and Pivni\u010dkova, 1987; Weiss et al., 2009a, 2015; Kristensen et al., 2010). The highest concentration of n-propanol was detected in a corn silage that had solely received heterofermentative LAB, but also one untreated silage contained this substance, which support findings by Hafner et al. (2014). Although n-propanol represents a typical minor end-product of anaerobic metabolism by yeasts (McDonald et al., 1991), it can also be formed by Lactobacillus diolivorans in conjunction with propionic acid via conversion of 1,2-propanediol (Krooneman et al., 2002).

        "summary": "In this context, Propane-1,2-diol is mentioned as a fermentation byproduct associated with the activity of Lactobacillus buchneri in corn silage. However, there is no direct or implied relationship to Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular. The discussion focuses on fermentation processes rather than any biological or medical implications related to autoimmune conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relevance between Propane-1,2-diol and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any connection or interaction discussed.",
