    "context": "For example, the effect of air by delayed sealing and air infiltration during the fermentation process showed, although not consistently, an influence on the fermentation pattern of corn silage. Also, the use of different inoculant types may partially explain alterations in fermentation patterns. In our farm survey, corn silage solely treated with heterofermentative LAB containing Lactobacillus buchneri had the highest acetic acid concentration, but this inoculant type was not tested in our ensiling experiments. Our observation that all farm silages contained 1,2-propanediol, which was not measured in the ensiling experiments, is likely attributable to the presence of epiphytic Lactobacillus buchneri on the crop at harvest and its activity during the fermentation process. This species, whose presence varies with location (Schmidt and Kung, 2010), is the only known 1,2-propanediol producer in silage converting lactate into acetate and this compound (Oude-Elferink et al., 2001). In our study, n-propanol was detected less frequently and at lower concentrations compared with previous investigations, which reported up to 19.1g/kg of DM (Kala\u010d and Pivni\u010dkova, 1987; Weiss et al., 2009a, 2015; Kristensen et al., 2010). The highest concentration of n-propanol was detected in a corn silage that had solely received heterofermentative LAB, but also one untreated silage contained this substance, which support findings by Hafner et al. (2014). ",

        "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is mentioned as a compound produced during the fermentation process of corn silage, specifically attributed to the activity of Lactobacillus buchneri. The fermentation process is influenced by various factors, including the type of inoculant used, which can alter the fermentation patterns and the resultant chemical composition of the silage, including the production of propane-1,2-diol. This indicates a direct relationship between the fermentation process and the presence of propane-1,2-diol as a byproduct.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between propane-1,2-diol and the fermentation process, as the compound's production is directly linked to the metabolic activity of specific bacteria during fermentation, supported by contextual evidence.",
