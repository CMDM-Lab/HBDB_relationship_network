    "context": "For example, the effect of air by delayed sealing and air infiltration during the fermentation process showed, although not consistently, an influence on the fermentation pattern of corn silage. Also, the use of different inoculant types may partially explain alterations in fermentation patterns. In our farm survey, corn silage solely treated with heterofermentative LAB containing Lactobacillus buchneri had the highest acetic acid concentration, but this inoculant type was not tested in our ensiling experiments. Our observation that all farm silages contained 1,2-propanediol, which was not measured in the ensiling experiments, is likely attributable to the presence of epiphytic Lactobacillus buchneri on the crop at harvest and its activity during the fermentation process. This species, whose presence varies with location (Schmidt and Kung, 2010), is the only known 1,2-propanediol producer in silage converting lactate into acetate and this compound (Oude-Elferink et al., 2001). In our study, n-propanol was detected less frequently and at lower concentrations compared with previous investigations, which reported up to 19.1g/kg of DM (Kala\u010d and Pivni\u010dkova, 1987; Weiss et al., 2009a, 2015; Kristensen et al., 2010). The highest concentration of n-propanol was detected in a corn silage that had solely received heterofermentative LAB, but also one untreated silage contained this substance, which support findings by Hafner et al. (2014). ",

        "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is identified as a product of fermentation processes involving Lactobacillus buchneri, a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium. The presence of this compound in corn silage is attributed to the fermentation activity of this specific LAB, which converts lactate into acetate and subsequently produces propane-1,2-diol. This indicates a direct relationship between the fermentation process and the production of propane-1,2-diol in silage.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as propane-1,2-diol is directly produced during the fermentation process facilitated by Lactobacillus buchneri, highlighting a critical biochemical relationship in the context of silage fermentation.",
