    "context": "The apparent effect of ethanol on ethyl lactate was always larger (6.84 to 10.1mg of ethyl lactate per 1g of ethanol when lactic acid values are constant; P <0.001) than that of lactic acid (1.71 to 2.70mg of ethyl lactate per 1g of lactic acid when ethanol values are constant). With regard to total ethyl ester levels, it can be stated that only ethanol was important in experiments 1 and 2 whereas in experiment 3 the model was improved by including acetic acid. Discussion Farm Survey According to Kung and Shaver (2001), the fermentation pattern of the farm silages was within the typical range for lactate, acetate, and ethanol despite the fact that they were characterized by atypical smell and were believed to have contributed to feed intake depression. The variables 1,2-propanediol, n-propanol, and especially ethyl esters are yet not used in silage evaluation. The sole use homofermentative inoculants in corn silage under farm and experimental conditions (experiment 3) appears not to increase lactic acid production due to the typically high numbers of epiphytic LAB (>106 cfu/g) on the crop at ensiling (Schmidt and Kung, 2010), which makes it very difficult for the added LAB to dominate the fermentation process. The large variation in lactate, acetate, and ethanol concentrations of the corn silages observed in our study supported previous findings from a large number of farms in the United States, Denmark, and Italy (Mari et al., 2009; Borreani and Tabacco, 2010; Kristensen et al., 2010; Tabacco et al., 2011). This may be associated with differences in the epiphytic populations of the crops at ensiling, climatic and silage management factors, and storage temperature. ",

        "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is mentioned alongside ethyl esters in the discussion of fermentation patterns in silage. While ethyl esters are noted as important in the evaluation of silage, propane-1,2-diol is listed among other compounds that are not yet utilized in this context. The relationship between propane-1,2-diol and esters is not explicitly detailed, indicating a potential connection but lacking direct evidence or interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both propane-1,2-diol and esters are mentioned in the context of fermentation and silage evaluation, but their specific relationship is not elaborated upon.",
