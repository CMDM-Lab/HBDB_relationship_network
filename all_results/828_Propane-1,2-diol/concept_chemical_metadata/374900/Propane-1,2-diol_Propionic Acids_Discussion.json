    "context": "This species, whose presence varies with location (Schmidt and Kung, 2010), is the only known 1,2-propanediol producer in silage converting lactate into acetate and this compound (Oude-Elferink et al., 2001). In our study, n-propanol was detected less frequently and at lower concentrations compared with previous investigations, which reported up to 19.1g/kg of DM (Kala\u010d and Pivni\u010dkova, 1987; Weiss et al., 2009a, 2015; Kristensen et al., 2010). The highest concentration of n-propanol was detected in a corn silage that had solely received heterofermentative LAB, but also one untreated silage contained this substance, which support findings by Hafner et al. (2014). Although n-propanol represents a typical minor end-product of anaerobic metabolism by yeasts (McDonald et al., 1991), it can also be formed by Lactobacillus diolivorans in conjunction with propionic acid via conversion of 1,2-propanediol (Krooneman et al., 2002). This, again, highlights the importance of the presence, prevalence, and abundance of certain microbial communities in silages on the production of certain fermentation products. The concentration of ethyl lactate in the farm silages was higher than that of ethyl acetate, thereby confirming previous results (Weiss et al., 2009a). Apparently, untreated silages and those that had received homofermentative inoculants contained similar quantities of ethyl lactate, as also shown in our ensiling experiment 3, but they had more than any other treated silages in the farm survey.

        "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is mentioned as a substrate that can be converted into propionic acid by specific microbial communities, particularly Lactobacillus diolivorans. This highlights a metabolic relationship where propane-1,2-diol serves as a precursor in the anaerobic fermentation process, leading to the production of propionic acid, which is significant in silage fermentation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between propane-1,2-diol and propionic acids, as the context discusses their metabolic relationship in the fermentation process, supported by specific microbial activity. This indicates a clear biochemical interaction relevant to the study of silage fermentation.",
