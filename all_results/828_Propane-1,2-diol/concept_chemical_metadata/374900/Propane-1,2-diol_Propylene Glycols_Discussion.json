    "context": "Schmidt and Kung (2010) detected much lower yeast counts in corn silage after 120d of fermentation when compared with those of the fresh forage from 5 different locations at ensiling. According to Weiss et al. (2009b), a very high proportion of the maximum ethanol content (77%) was produced within the first month of fermentation. This would also explain why aerobic stability by formic acid-based additives is usually higher than that of untreated silages after prolonged storage periods (Driehuis and van Wikselaar, 1996; Weiss and Auerbach, 2012b; H. Auerbach and K. Weiss, unpublished data). The lower concentration of n-propanol by the formic acid-based additives might have been caused by the inhibition of bacteria, which can anaerobically convert 1,2-propanediol to n-propanol and other compounds (Krooneman et al., 2002; Amin et al., 2013). As reported previously, there were no unequivocal effects of added homofermentative lactic acid bacteria on the formation of organic acids and ethanol (Kleinschmit et al., 2005; Filya and Sucu, 2010; Hafner et al., 2014). Normally, at the time of ensiling, fresh corn has a high number of epiphytic lactic acid bacteria (Lin et al., 1992), making it unlikely for added homofermentative inoculants to outperform them, especially if they were applied at typical inoculation rates of 100,000 cfu/g of forage as in our study. The count of yeasts and aerobic stability were not influenced by lactic acid bacteria treatment, confirming results by Kleinschmit et al. (2005) and Queiroz et al. (2013). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Propane-1,2-diol is mentioned as a compound that can be converted to n-propanol by bacteria during fermentation processes. Propylene Glycols, which include Propane-1,2-diol, are typically used in various applications, including food and pharmaceuticals. However, the context does not provide a direct relationship or detailed discussion about their specific interactions or significance in the fermentation process, focusing instead on the effects of additives on fermentation outcomes.",
