    "context": " [7] A similar increase in 8-isoprostane and CO levels was previously reported in patients with severe asthma.  [8] Considering the protective role of hemoxygenase activation, enhanced CO production could represent a mechanism to counteract the oxidative damage.  [9] Large controlled studies are required to establish the role of steroid treatment in modulating exhaled CO levels. [10] Nothing is known about the possible role of 8-isoprostane as a mediator of oxidative stress in cystic fibrosis, although this compound may have a role in the pathophysiology of oxidant damage due to its biological actions. [1] In conclusion, we have shown that lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are increased in patients with cystic fibrosis, as reflected by increased 8-isoprostane concentrations in breath condensate. [2] Measurement of 8-isoprostane by this non-invasive approach may provide the rational basis for dose finding studies of antioxidants and an important end point in clinical trials of these drugs in cystic fibrosis. Methods The Tayside Committee for Medical Research Ethics gave institutional approval to the study protocol before commencement of the trial. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, also referred to as 8-isoprostane, is implicated in the oxidative stress associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). The study indicates that increased levels of 8-isoprostane in breath condensate reflect heightened lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in CF patients. This suggests a potential role for 8-isoprostane as a biomarker for oxidative stress and a target for antioxidant therapies in CF management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and cystic fibrosis, as the context discusses the role of 8-isoprostane in oxidative stress specific to CF, supported by evidence of increased concentrations in patients. This indicates a clear relevance in the pathophysiology of the disease.",
