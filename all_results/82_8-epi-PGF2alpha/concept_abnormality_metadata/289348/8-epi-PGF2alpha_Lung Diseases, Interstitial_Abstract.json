    "context": "However, further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism responsible for the decrease of the inflammation and the oxidative stress mediated by SCMC-Lys. [1] BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis is characterised by oxidative stress in the airways. [2] Isoprostanes are prostaglandin isomers formed by free radical catalysed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. [3] 8-Isoprostane is increased in interstitial lung diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. [4] Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) are biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the airways, respectively. [1] METHODS Concentrations of 8-isoprostane in the breath condensate of 10 normal subjects and 19 patients with stable cystic fibrosis were measured using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). [2] Breath condensate is a non-invasive method of collecting airway secretions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in various lung diseases, including interstitial lung diseases and cystic fibrosis. The study highlights the increased levels of 8-isoprostane in patients with these conditions, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for oxidative stress and inflammation in lung pathology. However, the specific relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and interstitial lung diseases is not deeply explored beyond its mention as a relevant isoprostane in the context of oxidative stress.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and interstitial lung diseases, supported by evidence of increased isoprostane levels in these conditions. However, the exact mechanisms and interactions are not fully detailed, preventing a higher score.",
