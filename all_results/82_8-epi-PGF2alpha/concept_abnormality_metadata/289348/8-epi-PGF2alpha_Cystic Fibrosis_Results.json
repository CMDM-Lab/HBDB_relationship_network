[1] 8-Isoprostane, the most well characterised compound belonging to the F2-isoprostanes, a group of prostaglandin F2\u00ce\u00b1stereoisomers, is formed in vivo by reactive oxygen species (ROS) peroxidation of arachidonic acid, independent of the action of cyclo-oxygenase.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referenced as 8-isoprostane, is correlated with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients. The study indicates a significant negative correlation between 8-isoprostane levels in breath condensate and forced expiratory volume (FEV1), suggesting that higher oxidative stress, indicated by increased 8-isoprostane, may be associated with poorer lung function in cystic fibrosis. Additionally, a positive correlation with carbon monoxide levels further emphasizes the role of oxidative stress in this disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and cystic fibrosis, supported by quantitative correlations with lung function metrics. The evidence suggests that oxidative stress, indicated by 8-isoprostane levels, plays a critical role in the pathology of cystic fibrosis.",
