    "context": "However, the spirometric changes associated with exacerbation of COPD are usually very small, so lung function tests are not very useful in detecting exacerbations and are not expected to correlate with inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in airways (Aaran et al., 2001). In conclusion, our results support the existence of an enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress in airways of COPD subjects that significantly increase during acute exacerbations. They also suggest the usefulness of exhaled markers as the Interleukine-6 and the 8-isoprostane in the clinical management of this widespread respiratory disease. Furthermore, the reduction of exhaled Interleukine-6 and 8-isoprostane concentrations observed in COPD subjects after short-term administration of SCMC-Lys suggests anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of this drug that should be confirmed by a placebo-controlled study. However, further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism responsible for the decrease of the inflammation and the oxidative stress mediated by SCMC-Lys. [1] BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis is characterised by oxidative stress in the airways. [2] Isoprostanes are prostaglandin isomers formed by free radical catalysed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is mentioned as a marker of oxidative stress in the airways of patients with Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). The study highlights the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in COPD exacerbations, suggesting that exhaled markers like 8-isoprostane could be useful in clinical management. However, the specific relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and COPD is not deeply explored, indicating a need for further research to clarify its role as a biomarker in this disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is linked to oxidative stress in COPD, but the context does not provide extensive details on its specific interactions or implications within the disease beyond its mention as a marker.",
        "score": 3
