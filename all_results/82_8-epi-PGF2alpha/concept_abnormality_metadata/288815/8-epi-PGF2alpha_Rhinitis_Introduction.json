    "context": "On the other hand, O\u2019Sullivan et al. have reported increased urinary LTE4 both in the early and late phase airway response. In aspirin-sensitive asthmatics, a significant increase in LTE4 urinary concentration followed bronchial provocation with aspirin. These findings support our hypothesis that leukotrienes in EBC could be elevated after a positive bronchoprovocation test with the occupational allergen. The aim of our study is to monitor changes in EBC concentrations of leukotrienes (LT) and 8-isoprostane prior to and after bronchoprovocation tests in patients with suspected occupational asthma and/or rhinitis. Study subjects Forty-seven subjects enrolled in the study were patients of the Department of Occupational Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic, who had presented with suspected occupational asthma and/or rhinitis. The patients had medical history of bronchial asthma, rhinitis or cough and a workplace allergen was considered as a probable cause of their allergic symptoms. The aim of our work is to perform bronchoprovocation tests with these suspected occupational allergens. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is investigated alongside leukotrienes in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to monitor changes in patients with suspected occupational asthma and/or rhinitis. The study aims to assess the relationship between these biomarkers and allergic responses triggered by workplace allergens, indicating a potential link between 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels and rhinitis symptoms in affected individuals.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and rhinitis, as both are part of a study examining biomarkers related to allergic responses. The context suggests a clear relevance in understanding the pathophysiology of rhinitis in patients with occupational exposure.",
