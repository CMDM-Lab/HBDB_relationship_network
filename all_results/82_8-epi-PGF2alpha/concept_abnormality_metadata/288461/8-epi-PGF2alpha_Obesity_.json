    "context": "The presence of obesity, but not asthma, was associated with increased exhaled 8-isoprostane levels. On the other hand, plasma levels of 8-isoprostanes were higher in asthmatics, but no effect of obesity was observed. In addition, there was no correlation between exhaled and plasma 8-isoprostane levels. Based on these data, the authors inferred that while asthma increases systemic oxidative stress and obesity increases airway oxidative stress there was no synergism between plasma and exhaled 8-isoprostane levels. It is difficult to make a conclusion regarding the role of oxidative stress in obese asthmatics given the conflicting currently available data, but it is plausible that oxidative stress may not be a causative factor but rather may modulate asthma severity and alter response to medications. Adipokines in obesity related to asthma Adipose tissue produces a number of mediators, termed adipokines, which have significant metabolic effects. One of these adipokines, named leptin, is secreted by adipose tissue in direct proportion to the level of adiposity, 78 and acts, under healthy conditions, through the hypothalamus as an appetite suppressant and metabolic stimulant.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed in relation to oxidative stress levels associated with obesity. The study indicates that obesity is linked to increased exhaled 8-isoprostane levels, suggesting a relationship between obesity and airway oxidative stress. However, the lack of correlation between exhaled and plasma levels complicates the understanding of this relationship, indicating that while obesity may influence oxidative stress, the exact role of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in this context remains unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between obesity and 8-epi-PGF2alpha, as the context discusses how obesity is associated with increased levels of this biomarker. However, the complexity of the relationship and lack of direct causation prevent a higher score.",
        "score": 4
