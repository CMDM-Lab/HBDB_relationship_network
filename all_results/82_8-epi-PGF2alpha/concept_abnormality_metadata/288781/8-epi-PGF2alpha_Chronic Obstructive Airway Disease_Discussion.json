    "context": "This percentage of outlying values is comparable to that obtained in the present study (6.6%). Nevertheless, these authors also concluded that EBC pH is not systematically affected by patient age. The findings obtained for 8-isoprostane in the present study are similar to those seen for pH. Levels of 8-isoprostane are increased in EBC of patients with several respiratory diseases such as asthma, 26 COPD, 27 and cystic fibrosis. 28 In our study population, significant differences were found in 8-isoprotane levels between the younger groups (groups 1 and 2) and the oldest group (group 5) despite the fact that the values obtained in all the groups studied were within the normal limits described by other authors in the healthy population. 3 Moreover, in the present study, the number of samples with detectable values increased with age. According to some authors, 3,29 8-isoprostane is present in detectable amounts in all normal tissues and biological fluids and has been detected in EBC in healthy subjects, thus allowing definition of the normal range.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD) among other respiratory diseases. The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane are elevated in patients with COPD, suggesting its potential role in reflecting oxidative stress or inflammation associated with the disease. The findings imply a significant relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels and the presence of COPD, particularly as they vary with age in the studied population.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and COPD, supported by evidence of increased levels in patients with the disease. The context discusses its relevance as a biomarker for respiratory conditions, indicating a clear relationship within the study's findings.",
        "score": 4
