    "context": "In conclusion, oxidative stress, as measured by 8-isoprostane levels, was elevated in the airways and plasma of patients with OSA and was reduced by CPAP therapy. The concentration of 8-isoprostane increased after nocturnal apnea and was significantly reduced after CPAP therapy. Oxidative stress could have a key role in the link between OSA and the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Measurement of 8-isoprostane in the exhaled breath condensate of these patients therefore may help to identify patients with a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Materials and Methods Study Subjects The following three groups of white subjects were studied: 12 healthy children; 12 steroid-nai\u00a8ve asthmatic children; and 30 children in stable condition with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma who were treated with ICSs (Table 1 ). The asthmatic children (age range, 5 to 16 years) and healthy children (age range, 6 to 13 years) were matched for age. The diagnosis and classification of asthma was based on clinical history, physical examination, and pulmonary function parameters, which were measured according to international guidelines. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is linked to cardiovascular diseases through its elevated levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study suggests that increased oxidative stress, indicated by 8-isoprostane levels, may contribute to the heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases in these patients. Monitoring 8-epi-PGF2alpha could help identify individuals at greater risk for cardiovascular complications associated with OSA.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and cardiovascular diseases, supported by evidence of oxidative stress's role in OSA and its implications for cardiovascular risk. However, the relationship is primarily correlational rather than mechanistic.",
