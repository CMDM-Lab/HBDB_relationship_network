    "context": "This could then account for the positive correlation we found between 8-isoprostane concentrations in the exhaled breath condensate and in the plasma of OSA subjects. Although the precise cellular source of ROS in the upper airway is unknown, Saul et al 10 showed that inflammation is present in the soft palate of patients with OSA. Furthermore, Zakkar et al 35 demonstrated a decrease in the concentration of neutral endopeptidase (which cleaves proinflammatory peptides) in the uvula of patients with OSA compared to control subjects. It has been suggested that an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants may lead to atherogenesis, and that this may account for the several chronic cardiovascular complications that frequently are related to OSA. 36 37 In confirmation of our previous results, we observed a positive correlation between morning exhaled 8-isoprostane concentrations and neck circumference, suggesting that the measurement of exhaled oxidative stress markers may be useful in screening obese subjects who are at high risk of developing sleep apnea and in monitoring the progression of this syndrome. The lack of correlation of exhaled 8-isoprostane concentration with the percentage of TST oxyhemoglobin saturation at < 90% and ODI, in contrast to the positive correlation observed with AHI, argues against a role for hypoxia as a possible causative factor of the increase of the oxidative stress. 4 However, it is possible that there could be a relationship between 8-isoprostane and the number of oxygen desaturation episodes, rather than their severity. In the present study, we repeated measurements of exhaled 8-isoprostane levels in OSA subjects before sleeping (ie, 8:00 pm) and at waking (8:00 am), observing higher levels of this marker at 8:00 am but observing their reduction after 12 h of being awake.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is positively correlated with oxidative stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study indicates that elevated levels of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate and plasma are associated with inflammation and potential cardiovascular complications linked to OSA. This suggests that measuring 8-isoprostane could be useful for screening and monitoring OSA progression, highlighting its relevance in understanding the oxidative stress mechanisms involved in this syndrome.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and sleep apnea syndromes, supported by evidence of correlation with oxidative stress and inflammation in OSA patients. The findings suggest a potential role for 8-isoprostane in monitoring OSA, indicating a clear relationship.",
