    "context": "However, we do not think that a mean difference of 3.4 pg/ml in the mean postexposure increases in exhaled 8-isoprostane between placebo and budesonide groups is biologically relevant. We conclude that pretreatment with a high dose of inhaled budesonide did not not affect ozone-induced increase in 8-isoprostane. We have previously shown that ozone-induced airway inflammation as reflected by increased sputum neutrophil counts and myeloperoxidase levels in sputum supernatant in healthy volunteers is resistant to pretreatment with inhaled budesonide. Other authors showed a protective effect of inhaled beclomethasone on 8-isoprostane increase in BAL fluid induced by allergen-challenge in asthma patients. Selective effects of corticosteroids on the cell types primarily responsible for 8-isoprostane synthesis in the airways could explain this discrepancy. Different oxidant stimuli may be responsible for a selective recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways and these cell types may show a different response to inhaled corticosteroids. In fact, in our study sputum neutrophil increase after ozone exposure was resistant to inhaled budesonide, whereas in another study allergen-challenge-induced increase in eosinophil influx in the lung and the production of inflammatory mediators such as leukotriene B4 were reduced by corticosteroids.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is discussed as a marker of oxidative stress and airway inflammation in asthma patients. The study highlights the differential effects of corticosteroids like budesonide on 8-isoprostane levels in response to various inflammatory stimuli, suggesting that while corticosteroids may reduce 8-isoprostane production in allergen-induced asthma, they do not have the same effect in ozone-induced inflammation. This indicates a complex relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and asthma, particularly in the context of inflammatory responses and treatment efficacy.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and asthma, supported by evidence of its role as a biomarker for airway inflammation and the differential response to corticosteroid treatment in asthma patients. The context provides insights into the complexities of asthma inflammation and treatment.",
