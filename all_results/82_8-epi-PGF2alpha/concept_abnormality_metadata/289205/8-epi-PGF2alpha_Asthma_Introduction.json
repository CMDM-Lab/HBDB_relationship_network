    "context": "We have previously shown that 8-isoprostane, a member of the F2 isoprostane class, is increased in EBC of patients with inflammatory airway diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis, and in BAL fluid in patients with interstitial lung diseases [9\u201312]. Measurement of 8-isoprostane in EBC is potentially useful for noninvasive monitoring of ozone-induced oxidative stress in the lung. However, the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on 8-isoprostane are not clear. There is only one study showing that beclomethasone, an inhaled corticosteroid, reduces the 8-isoprostane increase in BAL in patients with asthma after antigen challenge. However, in a previous study, we were unable to demonstrate any effect of pretreatment with inhaled budesonide on ozone-induced increase in inflammatory markers such as neutrophils and myeloperoxidase in sputum in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate if oxidant stress, as reflected by exhaled 8-isoprostane, is affected by short-term ozone exposure and the effect of inhaled budesonide on free radical production after ozone exposure. Methods Subjects characteristics Nine healthy subjects were studied (four men and five women; age: 30 \u00b1 2.8 years, mean \u00b1 SEM). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is linked to asthma through its increased levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma. The study suggests that measuring 8-isoprostane could serve as a noninvasive marker for oxidative stress in asthma, particularly in response to ozone exposure. Additionally, the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on 8-isoprostane levels in asthma patients are explored, indicating a potential relationship between oxidative stress and asthma management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and asthma, supported by evidence of increased levels in patients with asthma and its potential role as a biomarker for oxidative stress in the disease context. The discussion of corticosteroid effects further strengthens this relationship.",
