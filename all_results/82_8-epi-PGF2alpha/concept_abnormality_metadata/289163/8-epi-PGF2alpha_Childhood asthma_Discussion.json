    "context": "In view of the fact that 8-isoprostane is produced by free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid on plasma membrane phospholipids, 14 all cells in the airways may release this eicosanoid. PGE2 is largely produced by epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells. 33 In conclusion, we have shown that oxidative stress is increased in children who are in stable condition with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma who were steroid-nai\u00a8ve or had been treated with ICSs, as reflected by increased 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC. These findings may justify clinical trials with antioxidants in childhood asthma for which the measurement of 8-isoprostane in EBC may provide a useful noninvasive biological marker. Introduction Ozone exposure in humans causes airway inflammation. This response is characterized by decreased lung function, increased bronchial reactivity to methacholine, and increases in inflammatory cells and markers in both bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid and induced sputum. We have recently demonstrated that lung inflammation induced by acute ozone exposure in healthy volunteers is not affected by pretreatment with budesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is linked to childhood asthma through its increased concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. The study suggests that elevated levels of this eicosanoid may indicate oxidative stress in asthmatic children, supporting the potential for antioxidants in treatment. Thus, 8-epi-PGF2alpha serves as a noninvasive biomarker for assessing oxidative stress in childhood asthma.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and childhood asthma, as the context provides evidence of increased levels of this marker in asthmatic children, indicating its relevance in understanding the disease's oxidative stress component.",
        "score": 4
