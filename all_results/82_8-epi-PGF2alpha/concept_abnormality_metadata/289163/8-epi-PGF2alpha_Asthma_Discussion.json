    "context": "For this reason, we were unable to ascertain the cellular source of 8-isoprostane and PGE2 in EBC for which invasive studies, such as bronchial biopsies, are required. In view of the fact that 8-isoprostane is produced by free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid on plasma membrane phospholipids, 14 all cells in the airways may release this eicosanoid. PGE2 is largely produced by epithelial and airway smooth muscle cells. 33 In conclusion, we have shown that oxidative stress is increased in children who are in stable condition with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma who were steroid-nai\u00a8ve or had been treated with ICSs, as reflected by increased 8-isoprostane concentrations in EBC. These findings may justify clinical trials with antioxidants in childhood asthma for which the measurement of 8-isoprostane in EBC may provide a useful noninvasive biological marker. Introduction Ozone exposure in humans causes airway inflammation. This response is characterized by decreased lung function, increased bronchial reactivity to methacholine, and increases in inflammatory cells and markers in both bronchoalveolar (BAL) fluid and induced sputum.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is highlighted as a marker of oxidative stress in children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. The study indicates that increased levels of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) correlate with oxidative stress in asthmatic patients, suggesting its potential role as a noninvasive biomarker for assessing asthma severity and inflammation. This relationship underscores the relevance of oxidative stress in asthma pathology.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and asthma, supported by evidence of increased levels in asthmatic children indicating oxidative stress. This suggests a clear relationship within the context of asthma management and potential clinical implications.",
