    "context": "Several indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, including pH, 8-isoprostane, and cytokines have been measured in exhaled breath condensate. These indicators differ between asthmatics and nonasthmatics and change acutely upon asthma exacerbation or treatment with asthma medication (Antus et al., 2010; Baraldi et al., 2003; Hunt et al., 2000; Montuschi et al., 2006). As biological markers of lung responses, analysis of these biomarkers may provide insight into diesel exhaust particle mechanisms of action and serve to link findings between experimental and epidemiologic studies. To improve understanding of the association between short-term exposure to ambient diesel exhaust particles and respiratory morbidity, we conducted a panel study involving continuous monitoring of black carbon outside two New York City high schools and measurement of pH and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate collected twice a week from students with and without asthma. Observations that ambient black carbon concentrations are associated with diesel exhaust particle concentrations and volume of diesel traffic but not car traffic support the measurement of black carbon as an indicator of diesel exhaust particles (Patel et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007). We hypothesized that short-term increases in ambient black carbon would be associated with decreases in exhaled breath condensate pH, reflecting increases in airway inflammation, and with increases in 8-isoprostane, reflecting increases in airway oxidative stress. Further, we hypothesized that the associations between black carbon and exhaled biomarkers would differ between asthmatic and nonasthmatic adolescents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is indirectly related to respiratory morbidity through its association with airway inflammation and oxidative stress indicators measured in exhaled breath condensate. The study investigates how short-term exposure to diesel exhaust particles affects these biomarkers, which may reflect respiratory health outcomes, particularly in asthmatic individuals. While 8-epi-PGF2alpha is not explicitly mentioned, its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress suggests a connection to respiratory morbidity in the context of diesel exposure and asthma exacerbation.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is linked to oxidative stress and airway inflammation, which are relevant to respiratory morbidity. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and 8-epi-PGF2alpha is not directly measured in the study.",
        "score": 3
