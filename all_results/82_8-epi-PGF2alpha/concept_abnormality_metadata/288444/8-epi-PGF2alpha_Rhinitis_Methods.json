    "context": "Appropriate linear transformation was applied on data whenever suggested by distributional diagnostic plots (symmetry plot, quantile plot) and descriptive statistic inspection (looking at variance stability among categories). To alleviate multivariate heteroscedasticity, a Box\u2013Cox power transformation on the dependent variable was applied to the data by means of maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. To compare the values among groups, a median test (a nonparametric K-sample test on the equality of medians) was performed, checking the null hypothesis that the K samples were drawn from populations with the same median. The relationship of 15F2t-IsoP with the other relevant variables was studied by means of the general linear model (GLM) analysis, that considers 15-F2t-IsoP as the dependent variable, while respiratory symptoms recorded by the questionnaire (cough, colds, catarrh, whistles, shortness of breath, lung disease, bronchitis, rhinitis and allergies), sampling sites, gender, Box\u2013Cox transformed level of cotinine, age (expressed as days since the birth date divided by 365.25), diet (percentage of subjects who ate red meat the dinner the day before), weight (kg), height (meters) and B.M.I. (weight/height(m)2), were the independent variables. To assess the relationship between lung function parameters (FEV1, FEF 25-75 and FEF50) and 15-F2t-IsoP, a different linear model (GLM) analysis was performed that considers 15-F2t-IsoP as the dependent variable, and gender, Box\u2013Cox transformed single lung function parameter and level of cotinine, age (years), diet (percentage of subjects who ate red meat the dinner the day before), weight (kg), height (meters) and B.M.I. (weight/height(m)2), as independent variables. The link function for GLM was selected following the Box\u2013Cox transformation. A p value of \u22640.05 (two-tailed) was considered significant for all tests. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed in relation to various respiratory symptoms, including rhinitis, as part of a study examining the effects of different variables on lung function and inflammatory markers. While rhinitis is mentioned among the respiratory symptoms, the specific relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and rhinitis is not directly explored, indicating a potential but unclear connection in the context of respiratory health.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 8-epi-PGF2alpha and rhinitis are part of the broader investigation into respiratory symptoms. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
