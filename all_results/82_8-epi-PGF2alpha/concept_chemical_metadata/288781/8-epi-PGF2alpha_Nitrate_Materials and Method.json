    "context": "Other aliquots were used to measure the pH before and after deaeration. pH Measurement pH was measured in one of the aliquots immediately after EBC collection and after deaeration with helium (350 mL/min for 10 min), using a calibrated pH meter (Model GLP 21; Crison Instruments SA; Barcelona, Spain) with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.01 pH, and a probe for small volumes (Crison 50 28; Crison Instruments SA). The probe was calibrated daily with standard pH 7.02 and 4.00 buffers. 12 EBC Nitrate, Nitrite, and 8-Isoprostane Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined with a colorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction in which sample duplicates were reacted with Griess reagent (Cayman Chemical; Ann Arbor, MI) and measured at 540 nm absorbance with a microplate reader. Assay sensitivity was 1 \u03bcmol/L for nitrite and 2.5 \u03bcmol/L for nitrate. Within-run were 6%, and 4%, and between-run coefficients of variation were 9% and 5% for nitrate and nitrite, respectively. The 8-isoprostane concentration was determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available kit (Cayman Chemical). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha and nitrate are both measured as part of a biochemical analysis involving exhaled breath condensate (EBC). While nitrate is quantified using a colorimetric assay, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is assessed through a competitive enzyme immunoassay. However, the relationship between these two compounds is not explicitly discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of biomarkers without direct interaction or significance highlighted in the context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 8-epi-PGF2alpha and nitrate are analyzed in the same study related to EBC, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
        "score": 2
