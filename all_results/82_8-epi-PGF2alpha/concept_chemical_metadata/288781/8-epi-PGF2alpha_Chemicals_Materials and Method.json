    "context": "Other aliquots were used to measure the pH before and after deaeration. pH Measurement pH was measured in one of the aliquots immediately after EBC collection and after deaeration with helium (350 mL/min for 10 min), using a calibrated pH meter (Model GLP 21; Crison Instruments SA; Barcelona, Spain) with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.01 pH, and a probe for small volumes (Crison 50 28; Crison Instruments SA). The probe was calibrated daily with standard pH 7.02 and 4.00 buffers. 12 EBC Nitrate, Nitrite, and 8-Isoprostane Nitrate and nitrite concentrations were determined with a colorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction in which sample duplicates were reacted with Griess reagent (Cayman Chemical; Ann Arbor, MI) and measured at 540 nm absorbance with a microplate reader. Assay sensitivity was 1 \u03bcmol/L for nitrite and 2.5 \u03bcmol/L for nitrate. Within-run were 6%, and 4%, and between-run coefficients of variation were 9% and 5% for nitrate and nitrite, respectively. The 8-isoprostane concentration was determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay using a commercially available kit (Cayman Chemical). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker related to the measurement of various chemicals, specifically nitrate and nitrite concentrations, in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The study employs colorimetric assays and enzyme immunoassays to quantify these chemicals, indicating that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may be part of a broader analysis involving chemical measurements, but no direct relationship or interaction between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and the chemicals is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is part of a study measuring chemicals in EBC, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific relationship with those chemicals.",
