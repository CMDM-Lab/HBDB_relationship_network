    "context": "Samples were frozen immediately after collection (\u221280\u00b0C). Breath condensate was collected during the control measurements without provocation four times within 24h, with the collection timed to match the measurements during the test, and five times in the specific bronchoprovocation test as indicated for spirometry. Spirometry measurement followed immediately after each EBC collection. 2.2.4 EBC analysis Immunoseparation with commercial cysteinyl leukotriene affinity sorbent (Cayman Chemicals, USA) and 8-isoprostane affinity sorbent (Cayman Chemicals, USA) was conducted as follows: 1ml of EBC, 50\u03bcl of each of the immunoaffinity sorbents, and 100pg of each of the deuterium-labeled standards ([6,7,14,15, 2H] leukotriene B4, [17,18,19,20, 2H] 8-isoprostane (Cayman Chemical, USA), [6,7,14, 2H] leukotriene E4 (Biomol, USA)) were mixed, the suspension was shaken for 120min at 20\u00b0C and subjected to centrifugation, followed by sorbent separation and washing with water (2\u00d71ml). After that, methanol (2\u00d70.5ml) was added for substrate elution from the antibody\u2013substrate complex; the suspension was shaken for 5min and then centrifuged with subsequent supernatant separation. The solvent was removed from the supernatant (stripping with nitrogen) and 50\u03bcl of a mobile phase was added. After these steps samples were ready for LC/MS analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed as part of breath condensate samples collected for testing, which involves various chemicals used in the immunoseparation process. The mention of 'chemicals' refers broadly to the reagents and standards utilized in the analysis, but there is no specific discussion of how 8-epi-PGF2alpha interacts with or relates to these chemicals beyond its role as a target for measurement in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is part of a broader analysis involving various chemicals, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relevance to each other.",
