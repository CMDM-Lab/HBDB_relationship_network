    "context": "Samples were frozen immediately after collection (\u221280\u00b0C). Breath condensate was collected during the control measurements without provocation four times within 24h, with the collection timed to match the measurements during the test, and five times in the specific bronchoprovocation test as indicated for spirometry. Spirometry measurement followed immediately after each EBC collection. 2.2.4 EBC analysis Immunoseparation with commercial cysteinyl leukotriene affinity sorbent (Cayman Chemicals, USA) and 8-isoprostane affinity sorbent (Cayman Chemicals, USA) was conducted as follows: 1ml of EBC, 50\u03bcl of each of the immunoaffinity sorbents, and 100pg of each of the deuterium-labeled standards ([6,7,14,15, 2H] leukotriene B4, [17,18,19,20, 2H] 8-isoprostane (Cayman Chemical, USA), [6,7,14, 2H] leukotriene E4 (Biomol, USA)) were mixed, the suspension was shaken for 120min at 20\u00b0C and subjected to centrifugation, followed by sorbent separation and washing with water (2\u00d71ml). After that, methanol (2\u00d70.5ml) was added for substrate elution from the antibody\u2013substrate complex; the suspension was shaken for 5min and then centrifuged with subsequent supernatant separation. The solvent was removed from the supernatant (stripping with nitrogen) and 50\u03bcl of a mobile phase was added. After these steps samples were ready for LC/MS analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed in breath condensate samples, where deuterium-labeled standards are used as internal controls during the immunoseparation process. The use of deuterium-labeled compounds helps in quantifying the levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha accurately in the samples, indicating a methodological relationship where deuterium serves as a tracer in the analysis of this biomarker.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and deuterium, as deuterium-labeled standards are essential for the accurate measurement of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in the study. This relationship is supported by the experimental design and methodology described in the context.",
