    "context": "[2] Every biomarker has its own chemical and physical characteristics. [3] Currently, one may speculate that most eicosanoids act in a similar way. [4] Likewise, small proteins such as cytokines may act differently from eicosanoids, but similarly when comparing one cytokine to another. [1] The present authors conclude that a condenser system with a silicone or glass coating is more efficient for the measurement of 8-isoprostane or albumin in exhaled breath condensate, compared with the EcoScreen\u00c2\u00ae, or condensers with aluminum, polypropylene or Teflon coating. [2] The increased efficiency of the borosilicate glass and silicone coatings may be due to less adhesive properties resulting in more biomarker recovery in the condensate. [3] To establish methodological standardisation of the collection of exhaled breath condensate, the most valid and inert condenser coating has to be applied for the measurement of a specific inflammatory biomarker. [1] The aim of this study was to develop a technique for the collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from ventilated children and assess its safety and feasibility. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker that can be measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), while aluminum is referenced in relation to the efficiency of different condenser coatings for collecting EBC. The study suggests that aluminum coatings are less effective compared to silicone or glass coatings for recovering biomarkers like 8-epi-PGF2alpha, indicating a potential negative impact of aluminum on the measurement accuracy of this biomarker.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the impact of aluminum coatings on the recovery of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in EBC collection, indicating a specific interaction related to measurement efficiency.",
        "score": 3
