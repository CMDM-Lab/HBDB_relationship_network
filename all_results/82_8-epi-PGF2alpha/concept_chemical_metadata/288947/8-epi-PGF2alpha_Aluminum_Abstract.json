    "context": "[2] A similar trend was observed for 8-isoprostane recovery. [3] In vivo, median (interquartile range) 8-isoprostane concentrations were significantly higher using silicone (9.2 (18.8)\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1) or glass (3.0 (4.5)\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1) coating, compared with aluminium (0.5 (2.4)\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1), polypropylene (0.5 (0.5)\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1), Teflon (0.5 (0.0)\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1), and EcoScreen\u00c2\u00ae (0.5 (2.0)\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1). [4] Albumin in vivo was mainly detectable using glass coating. [1] In conclusion, a condenser with silicone or glass coating is more efficient for measurement of 8-isoprostane or albumin in exhaled breath condensate, than EcoScreen\u00c2\u00ae, aluminium, polypropylene or Teflon. [2] Guidelines for exhaled breath condensate standardisation should include the most valid condenser coating to measure a specific biomarker. [1] The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has been rediscovered as a simple and noninvasive technique to measure mediators of airway inflammation. [2] EBC consists not only of water vapor, but also contains aerosolised respiratory fluid droplets released from the respiratory epithelial lining fluid (ELF). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using various condenser coatings, including aluminum. The study indicates that aluminum coating results in significantly lower concentrations of 8-isoprostane compared to silicone and glass coatings. This suggests that the choice of material for the condenser can affect the recovery of this biomarker, highlighting a potential limitation of using aluminum in such measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and aluminum, as the study provides quantitative data showing that aluminum coating leads to lower recovery of 8-isoprostane, indicating a clear relationship in the context of biomarker measurement.",
