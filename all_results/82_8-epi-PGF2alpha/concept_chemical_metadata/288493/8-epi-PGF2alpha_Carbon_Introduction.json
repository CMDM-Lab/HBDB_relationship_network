    "context": "Several indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, including pH, 8-isoprostane, and cytokines have been measured in exhaled breath condensate. These indicators differ between asthmatics and nonasthmatics and change acutely upon asthma exacerbation or treatment with asthma medication (Antus et al., 2010; Baraldi et al., 2003; Hunt et al., 2000; Montuschi et al., 2006). As biological markers of lung responses, analysis of these biomarkers may provide insight into diesel exhaust particle mechanisms of action and serve to link findings between experimental and epidemiologic studies. To improve understanding of the association between short-term exposure to ambient diesel exhaust particles and respiratory morbidity, we conducted a panel study involving continuous monitoring of black carbon outside two New York City high schools and measurement of pH and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate collected twice a week from students with and without asthma. Observations that ambient black carbon concentrations are associated with diesel exhaust particle concentrations and volume of diesel traffic but not car traffic support the measurement of black carbon as an indicator of diesel exhaust particles (Patel et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007). We hypothesized that short-term increases in ambient black carbon would be associated with decreases in exhaled breath condensate pH, reflecting increases in airway inflammation, and with increases in 8-isoprostane, reflecting increases in airway oxidative stress. Further, we hypothesized that the associations between black carbon and exhaled biomarkers would differ between asthmatic and nonasthmatic adolescents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker related to oxidative stress in exhaled breath condensate, while carbon, specifically black carbon, is linked to diesel exhaust particles that may exacerbate airway inflammation. The study aims to explore the relationship between black carbon exposure and changes in biomarkers like 8-isoprostane, which is related to oxidative stress. Although both terms are involved in the study of respiratory health, their direct relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing instead on the broader context of air quality and its effects on asthma.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both 8-epi-PGF2alpha and carbon are involved in the study of respiratory health and oxidative stress, but their specific interaction is not deeply explored in the context provided.",
        "score": 3
