    "context": "Thus, F2-isoprostanes, a chemically stable group of bioactive compounds, appear to play a role in acute and sub-clinical chronic inflammations (Basu et al., 2009) and are utilized as non-invasive markers of airways inflammation (Basu, 2008) and asthma (Wedes et al., 2009). They may describe the possible role of some exogenous factors in the expression of oxidative stress in selected populations. They can also be implicated in a large number of human diseases, even if a clear correlation between disease and oxidative stress is far from being proven for most pathological conditions (Giustarini et al., 2009). In the fully aware that oxidative stress originates from many endogenous and exogenous factors, purpose of this study was to clarify the role in the biosynthesis of 15-F2t-isoprostane (15-F2t-IsoP) of two of these exogenous factors: exposure to tobacco smoke and air pollution. Given the scarcity of information in this regard, the study was conducted in a population of adolescents living in two areas of the Piedmont Region (North-Western Italy) characterized by different geographical conditions and levels of urbanization and taking into account their passive exposure to tobacco smoke. Methods Sampling sites Two sampling sites were selected taking into account different urbanization, anthropization and vehicular traffic conditions. Chivasso is an urbanized town with about 26,000inhabitants (514inhabitants/km2), located at 180m a.s.l. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of F2-isoprostane, is discussed in relation to oxidative stress and inflammation, but there is no direct mention of its role in anabolism. While F2-isoprostanes are implicated in various diseases and oxidative stress responses, the connection to anabolic processes is not established or explored in the provided text. Thus, the relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and anabolism remains unclear and indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, but there is no detailed discussion or evidence linking it directly to anabolic processes in the context provided.",
