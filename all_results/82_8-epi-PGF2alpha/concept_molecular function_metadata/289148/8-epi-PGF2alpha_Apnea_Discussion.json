    "context": "Due to the relatively small number of subjects included in the response to CPAP therapy, our conclusions require confirmation in a larger series of OSA patients. Nevertheless, in our study each subject served as his/her own control, and the changes in 8-isoprostane levels before and after sleeping or during CPAP treatment were still present after sleep. In conclusion, oxidative stress, as measured by 8-isoprostane levels, was elevated in the airways and plasma of patients with OSA and was reduced by CPAP therapy. The concentration of 8-isoprostane increased after nocturnal apnea and was significantly reduced after CPAP therapy. Oxidative stress could have a key role in the link between OSA and the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Measurement of 8-isoprostane in the exhaled breath condensate of these patients therefore may help to identify patients with a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Materials and Methods Study Subjects The following three groups of white subjects were studied: 12 healthy children; 12 steroid-nai\u00a8ve asthmatic children; and 30 children in stable condition with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma who were treated with ICSs (Table 1 ).

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is linked to apnea through its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane increase after episodes of nocturnal apnea and decrease with CPAP therapy, suggesting a relationship between oxidative stress and the physiological effects of apnea. This connection highlights the potential of measuring 8-epi-PGF2alpha as a means to assess cardiovascular risk in OSA patients.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and apnea, supported by evidence showing changes in 8-isoprostane levels in response to apnea and CPAP treatment. This indicates a clear relationship within the context of oxidative stress and its implications for cardiovascular health.",
