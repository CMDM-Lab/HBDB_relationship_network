    "context": "The lack of correlation of exhaled 8-isoprostane concentration with the percentage of TST oxyhemoglobin saturation at < 90% and ODI, in contrast to the positive correlation observed with AHI, argues against a role for hypoxia as a possible causative factor of the increase of the oxidative stress. 4 However, it is possible that there could be a relationship between 8-isoprostane and the number of oxygen desaturation episodes, rather than their severity. In the present study, we repeated measurements of exhaled 8-isoprostane levels in OSA subjects before sleeping (ie, 8:00 pm) and at waking (8:00 am), observing higher levels of this marker at 8:00 am but observing their reduction after 12 h of being awake. These findings are consistent with previous observations, according to which the nocturnal apneas, through repeated hypoxia as a result of the mechanic obstruction, could be responsible for oxidative stress in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. 3 The rapid reduction of 8-isoprostane that we observed in OSA patients after CPAP therapy might be a further advantage of this therapy. 37 In this respect, our findings are consistent with those of Schulz et al, 4 who also demonstrated a beneficial effect of CPAP on oxidative stress. There are some potential limitations to our study that deserve comment. Due to the relatively small number of subjects included in the response to CPAP therapy, our conclusions require confirmation in a larger series of OSA patients. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is examined as a marker of oxidative stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where hypoxia is a contributing factor due to repeated oxygen desaturation episodes. The study suggests that while hypoxia may not directly correlate with 8-isoprostane levels, it could influence oxidative stress through the frequency of desaturation events. The findings indicate that CPAP therapy reduces oxidative stress, highlighting a potential indirect relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and hypoxia in the context of OSA.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the study discusses the relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and hypoxia in the context of oxidative stress in OSA, indicating some interaction but not a direct causative link.",
