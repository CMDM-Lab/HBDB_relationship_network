    "context": "Higher morning levels of 8-isoprostane also were observed in the venous blood of the OSA patients (9.7 \u00b1 1.5 pg/mL) compared to the control subjects (7.1 \u00b1 0.3 pg/mL; p < 0.0001). No significant differences were found in the morning 8-isoprostane concentrations in the exhaled breath condensate and plasma of OSA patients and healthy controls (p = 0.4 and p = 0.2, respectively) [Fig 1 , top, A]. A positive correlation was observed between morning levels of exhaled 8-isoprostane and plasma 8-isoprostane (r = 0.8; p < 0.0001) [Fig 1, bottom, B]. Greater concentrations of exhaled 8-isoprostane were found in OSA patients at 8:00 am than at 8:00 pm (9.5 \u00b1 1.9 and 7.6 \u00b1 0.8 pg/mL, respectively; p < 0.0005) [Fig 2 , top, A]. No differences were observed in evening levels of 8-isoprostane between OSA patients and control subjects (7.6 \u00b1 0.8 and 6.8 \u00b1 0.2 pg/mL, respectively; p = 0.2). A significant reduction in morning exhaled 8-isoprostane levels was found after CPAP therapy (before therapy, 9.6 \u00b1 1.7 pg/mL; after therapy, 7.7 \u00b1 0.9 pg/mL; p < 0.005) [Fig 2, bottom, B). No differences were observed in the concentrations of exhaled 8-isoprostane at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm in healthy subjects (6.7 \u00b1 0.2 and 6.5 \u00b1 0.9 pg/mL, respectively). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically measured as 8-isoprostane, is analyzed in relation to exhalation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study finds a positive correlation between morning levels of exhaled 8-isoprostane and plasma levels, indicating that exhalation can serve as a noninvasive method to assess oxidative stress in OSA patients. However, no significant differences in exhaled levels were found between OSA patients and healthy controls, suggesting that while exhalation is relevant for measuring 8-epi-PGF2alpha, its diagnostic utility may be limited in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and exhalation, as the study provides quantitative data showing a correlation between exhaled and plasma levels. However, the lack of significant differences between groups limits the strength of this relationship.",
