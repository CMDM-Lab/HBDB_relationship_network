    "context": "In conclusion, oxidative stress, as measured by 8-isoprostane levels, was elevated in the airways and plasma of patients with OSA and was reduced by CPAP therapy. The concentration of 8-isoprostane increased after nocturnal apnea and was significantly reduced after CPAP therapy. Oxidative stress could have a key role in the link between OSA and the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Measurement of 8-isoprostane in the exhaled breath condensate of these patients therefore may help to identify patients with a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Materials and Methods Study Subjects The following three groups of white subjects were studied: 12 healthy children; 12 steroid-nai\u00a8ve asthmatic children; and 30 children in stable condition with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma who were treated with ICSs (Table 1 ). The asthmatic children (age range, 5 to 16 years) and healthy children (age range, 6 to 13 years) were matched for age. The diagnosis and classification of asthma was based on clinical history, physical examination, and pulmonary function parameters, which were measured according to international guidelines. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is measured in the exhaled breath condensate of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study highlights that elevated levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha correlate with oxidative stress in the airways and plasma, suggesting that exhalation analysis of this compound could help identify patients at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases associated with OSA.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and exhalation, as the measurement of this compound in exhaled breath is directly linked to assessing oxidative stress in patients, indicating its potential as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk.",
        "score": 4
