    "context": "The lack of correlation of exhaled 8-isoprostane concentration with the percentage of TST oxyhemoglobin saturation at < 90% and ODI, in contrast to the positive correlation observed with AHI, argues against a role for hypoxia as a possible causative factor of the increase of the oxidative stress. 4 However, it is possible that there could be a relationship between 8-isoprostane and the number of oxygen desaturation episodes, rather than their severity. In the present study, we repeated measurements of exhaled 8-isoprostane levels in OSA subjects before sleeping (ie, 8:00 pm) and at waking (8:00 am), observing higher levels of this marker at 8:00 am but observing their reduction after 12 h of being awake. These findings are consistent with previous observations, according to which the nocturnal apneas, through repeated hypoxia as a result of the mechanic obstruction, could be responsible for oxidative stress in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. 3 The rapid reduction of 8-isoprostane that we observed in OSA patients after CPAP therapy might be a further advantage of this therapy. 37 In this respect, our findings are consistent with those of Schulz et al, 4 who also demonstrated a beneficial effect of CPAP on oxidative stress. There are some potential limitations to our study that deserve comment. Due to the relatively small number of subjects included in the response to CPAP therapy, our conclusions require confirmation in a larger series of OSA patients. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed as a marker of oxidative stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where mechanical obstruction leads to repeated hypoxia. The study suggests that the increase in 8-isoprostane levels may be linked to episodes of oxygen desaturation caused by airway obstruction during sleep. The findings indicate that the oxidative stress associated with OSA is potentially driven by the mechanical obstruction and subsequent hypoxic events, highlighting a significant relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and obstruction.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and obstruction, as the study provides evidence that mechanical obstruction in OSA leads to oxidative stress, indicated by elevated levels of 8-isoprostane. This relationship is supported by the observed changes in 8-isoprostane levels in response to CPAP therapy.",
