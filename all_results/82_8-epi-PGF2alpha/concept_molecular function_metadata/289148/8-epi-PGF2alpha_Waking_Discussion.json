    "context": "It has been suggested that an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants may lead to atherogenesis, and that this may account for the several chronic cardiovascular complications that frequently are related to OSA. 36 37 In confirmation of our previous results, we observed a positive correlation between morning exhaled 8-isoprostane concentrations and neck circumference, suggesting that the measurement of exhaled oxidative stress markers may be useful in screening obese subjects who are at high risk of developing sleep apnea and in monitoring the progression of this syndrome. The lack of correlation of exhaled 8-isoprostane concentration with the percentage of TST oxyhemoglobin saturation at < 90% and ODI, in contrast to the positive correlation observed with AHI, argues against a role for hypoxia as a possible causative factor of the increase of the oxidative stress. 4 However, it is possible that there could be a relationship between 8-isoprostane and the number of oxygen desaturation episodes, rather than their severity. In the present study, we repeated measurements of exhaled 8-isoprostane levels in OSA subjects before sleeping (ie, 8:00 pm) and at waking (8:00 am), observing higher levels of this marker at 8:00 am but observing their reduction after 12 h of being awake. These findings are consistent with previous observations, according to which the nocturnal apneas, through repeated hypoxia as a result of the mechanic obstruction, could be responsible for oxidative stress in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. 3 The rapid reduction of 8-isoprostane that we observed in OSA patients after CPAP therapy might be a further advantage of this therapy. 37 In this respect, our findings are consistent with those of Schulz et al, 4 who also demonstrated a beneficial effect of CPAP on oxidative stress. There are some potential limitations to our study that deserve comment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is measured in exhaled breath of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at two time points: before sleeping and upon waking. The study finds higher levels of this marker in the morning, suggesting that oxidative stress may be influenced by sleep patterns and the severity of OSA. The reduction of 8-epi-PGF2alpha after waking indicates a potential link between sleep duration and oxidative stress levels, highlighting the importance of monitoring this marker in relation to sleep health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and waking, as the study provides evidence of higher oxidative stress levels upon waking and their reduction throughout the day, indicating a clear relationship with sleep patterns and OSA.",
        "score": 4
