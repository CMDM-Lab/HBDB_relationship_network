    "context": " [8] Identical aluminium tubes were coated internally with Tempcoat 1011F (Teflon) by Imbreglon BV.  [9] The polypropylene tubes were produced by Applikon BV (Schiedam, the Netherlands). [10] The outer surface of the inner cylinder was in direct contact with the counter current circulating ice water, while its inner surface was in direct contact with the exhaled breath or the volatile substances derived from the nebuliser and propelled by the ventilator. [11] The nebuliser was filled with a biomarker test solution (42\u00e2\u20ac\u2026pg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1 8-isoprostane or 0.1\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mg\u00c2\u00b7mL-1 albumin in a 22\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mL saline 0.9% solution), which was nebulised and propelled by a ventilator through the condenser system, simulating tidal breathing for 15\u00e2\u20ac\u2026min (ventilator settings: inspiration time 33%, respiratory frequency 20\u00c2\u00b7min-1, tidal volume 200\u00e2\u20ac\u2026mL). [12] The construction of the collection device only allowed contact between the propelled air/exhaled breath and one specific type of inner coating that was chosen at that moment (fig. [13] 1b\u00e2\u2021\u201c). [14] The condensate was collected at the open end of the condenser device directly into vials. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker test solution that is nebulized and propelled through a ventilator, simulating tidal breathing. This process involves the exhaled breath, indicating a direct relationship between the measurement of 8-epi-PGF2alpha and respiration. The study aims to analyze volatile substances derived from exhaled breath, highlighting the significance of respiration in the assessment of this biomarker.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and respiration, as the biomarker is directly linked to the respiratory process through nebulization and exhalation. The context provides evidence of their interaction in a physiological setting.",
