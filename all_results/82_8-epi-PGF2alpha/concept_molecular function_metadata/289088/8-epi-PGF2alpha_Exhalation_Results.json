    "context": "However, the Interleukine-6 levels in exhaled breath condensate of the remaining 15 COPD patients who did not received any therapy (group B) did not change significantly over 6 months (5.7\u00b10.5 vs. 5.9\u00b10.6 pg/ml; T3; Fig. 3B). Concentrations of exhaled Interleukine-6 were significantly lower in group A than in group B at T2 (8.9\u00b11.5 vs. 12.7\u00b13.8, p<0.005). There was a positive correlation between exhaled Interleukine-6 and exhaled 8-isoprostane (r=0.8, p<0.0001; Fig. 4 ). Reproducibility of exhaled Interleukine-6 measurements was assessed in 10 nonsmoking normal and 10 COPD subjects. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (also known as 8-isoprostane) is mentioned in relation to exhalation as a biomarker. The study indicates a positive correlation between exhaled Interleukin-6 and exhaled 8-isoprostane levels in COPD patients, suggesting that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may serve as a relevant indicator of inflammatory processes in exhaled breath. This highlights its potential role in assessing respiratory conditions through breath analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and exhalation, supported by quantitative data showing a strong correlation with exhaled Interleukin-6 levels. This suggests that 8-epi-PGF2alpha is relevant in the context of respiratory inflammation and could be a useful biomarker in breath analysis.",
