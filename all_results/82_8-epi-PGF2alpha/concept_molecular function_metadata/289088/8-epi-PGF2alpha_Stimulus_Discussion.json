    "context": "However, monitoring inflammation and oxidative stress in COPD is difficult and may not be reflected by changes in blood and urine markers (Paredi et al., 2002). For this reason, in this study, we use a bodily fluid that reflects airways situation, the breath condensate. The recent interest that this lung's sample is generating is justified by its several advantages compared to other distrectual samples (bronchoalveolar lavage, induced sputum and lung biopsy), such as its completely noninvasiveness, simplicity, practicity and tolerability (Kharitonov and Barnes, 2001a,b). We measured in the breath condensate of COPD patients the 8-isoprostane (8-epi-prostaglandin-F2\u03b1), the predominant isoprostane formed in humans used as quantitative index of oxidative stress in vivo and the interleukin-6, a proinflammatory cytokine produced by epithelial cells and macrophages, expressed in response to various inflammatory stimuli (Carpagnano et al., 2003a,b; Montuschi et al., 2000). The increased exhaled concentrations of both markers that we found in COPD compared to healthy controls further confirm the presence of a marked inflammation and oxidative stress in their airways. We enrolled in this study COPD patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of COPD. In agreement with Biernacki et al. (2003), we observed a further increase of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in the breath condensate of these patients that significantly fall after 2 weeks of treatment with antibiotics (Partico et al., 1998).

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is identified as a predominant isoprostane used as a quantitative index of oxidative stress in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is measured in breath condensate, which reflects airway inflammation and oxidative stress in response to various inflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin-6. The relationship indicates that 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels can serve as a biomarker for oxidative stress triggered by inflammatory stimuli in COPD patients.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and inflammatory stimuli, as the study demonstrates that increased levels of this isoprostane correlate with oxidative stress and inflammation in COPD, supported by quantitative measurements.",
        "score": 4
