    "context": "However, the spirometric changes associated with exacerbation of COPD are usually very small, so lung function tests are not very useful in detecting exacerbations and are not expected to correlate with inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in airways (Aaran et al., 2001). In conclusion, our results support the existence of an enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress in airways of COPD subjects that significantly increase during acute exacerbations. They also suggest the usefulness of exhaled markers as the Interleukine-6 and the 8-isoprostane in the clinical management of this widespread respiratory disease. Furthermore, the reduction of exhaled Interleukine-6 and 8-isoprostane concentrations observed in COPD subjects after short-term administration of SCMC-Lys suggests anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions of this drug that should be confirmed by a placebo-controlled study. However, further studies are required to elucidate the exact mechanism responsible for the decrease of the inflammation and the oxidative stress mediated by SCMC-Lys. [1] BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis is characterised by oxidative stress in the airways. [2] Isoprostanes are prostaglandin isomers formed by free radical catalysed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is indirectly related to exhalation as it is mentioned alongside exhaled markers like Interleukin-6 in the assessment of inflammation and oxidative stress in COPD patients. The study suggests that exhaled markers can be useful in clinical management, indicating that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may be measured in exhaled breath to evaluate oxidative stress in respiratory diseases, although its specific role in exhalation is not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is discussed in the context of exhaled markers for assessing oxidative stress in COPD, indicating a connection but lacking detailed exploration of its specific relationship to exhalation.",
