    "context": " [7] A similar increase in 8-isoprostane and CO levels was previously reported in patients with severe asthma.  [8] Considering the protective role of hemoxygenase activation, enhanced CO production could represent a mechanism to counteract the oxidative damage.  [9] Large controlled studies are required to establish the role of steroid treatment in modulating exhaled CO levels. [10] Nothing is known about the possible role of 8-isoprostane as a mediator of oxidative stress in cystic fibrosis, although this compound may have a role in the pathophysiology of oxidant damage due to its biological actions. [1] In conclusion, we have shown that lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress are increased in patients with cystic fibrosis, as reflected by increased 8-isoprostane concentrations in breath condensate. [2] Measurement of 8-isoprostane by this non-invasive approach may provide the rational basis for dose finding studies of antioxidants and an important end point in clinical trials of these drugs in cystic fibrosis. Methods The Tayside Committee for Medical Research Ethics gave institutional approval to the study protocol before commencement of the trial. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed as a potential mediator of oxidative stress, particularly in relation to cystic fibrosis. The increased levels of 8-isoprostane in breath condensate indicate lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage, suggesting a direct relationship with oxidants. This highlights the role of 8-isoprostane in the pathophysiology of oxidative stress and its potential as a biomarker for antioxidant treatment efficacy in clinical trials.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and oxidants, as the context discusses the role of 8-isoprostane in oxidative stress and its implications in cystic fibrosis, supported by evidence of increased concentrations indicating oxidative damage.",
