    "context": "[3] Due to their stability, specificity for lipid peroxidation, in vivo production, and relative abundance in biological fluids, the isoprostanes are among the most reliable biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. [4] 8-Isoprostane, a member of the F2 isoprostane class, has been detected in plasma and urine in humans and its levels are increased in pathophysiological conditions in which oxidative stress is increased, such as cigarette smoking and scleroderma. [5] We have found increased concentrations of 8-isoprostane in the BAL fluid of patients with interstitial lung diseases. [6] 8-Isoprostane concentrations are also increased in the urine of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in exhaled breath condensate in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and asthma.Recently, increased 8-isoprostane concentrations were reported in the plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. [1] In this study we have compared 8-isoprostane concentrations in the breath condensate of patients with stable cystic fibrosis with those in normal subjects. [2] Breath condensate is a non-invasive method of collecting airway secretions. [3] The aim of this study was to provide a non-invasive approach to direct measurement of oxidant stress in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, which can be measured in exhaled breath condensate. The study aims to compare 8-isoprostane levels in the breath of cystic fibrosis patients versus normal subjects, indicating a direct relationship between the measurement of this biomarker and the method of exhalation for assessing lung oxidative stress.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is directly measured in exhaled breath condensate, establishing a critical relationship between the biomarker and the method of exhalation in assessing oxidative stress in lung diseases.",
        "score": 5
