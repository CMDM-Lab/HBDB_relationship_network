    "context": "Therefore, our data were accurate in analyzing the levels of these chemicals in human DNA. The level of 5-mdC present in the DNA sample was expressed as a percentage of total cytosine content (methylated and non-methylated). The DNA methylation level was expressed as either [5-mdC]/[dG] with adjustment to the respective 15N-labeled internal standards, or as [5-mdC]/([5-mdC]+[dC]) without internal standard adjustments. The use of dG as an internal standard allows a more simple and accurate determination of dC methylation and avoids the use of expensive isotope-labeled internal standards.Analysis of EBC 8-isoprostane The EBC was collected by ECoScreen (made by JAEGER GmbH, Wuerzburg, Germany) in polypropylene tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. EBC 8-isoprostane levels were measured by LC\u2013MS/MS, as described in previous study.Statistical analysis Spearman correlation coefficients were used to study the relationships between urinary 8-OHdG, WBC 8-OHdG, and global methylation levels. The distribution of 8-OHdG and global methylation levels were not normal, so the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallist test were used to detect differences in biomarkers between groups. Groups included workers exposed to nanomaterial vs. non-exposed controls, SiO2 handling workers vs. controls, TiO2 handling workers vs. controls, and ITO handling workers vs. controls. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker analyzed in the study, while adjudication refers to the process of evaluating and interpreting the data collected. However, there is no direct relationship or interaction discussed between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and adjudication. The focus is on the analysis of chemical levels in DNA and other biomarkers without linking them to a decision-making process or criteria for adjudication.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the context without any direct connection or relevance to each other.",
