    "context": "There are no studies on the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on 8-isoprostane in EBC. The mean increase in exhaled 8-isoprostane after ozone exposure in the placebo and budesonide groups was 20.0 pg/ml and 17.7 pg/ml, respectively. There was an apparent difference in the mean postexposure increases in exhaled 8-isoprostane between placebo and budesonide groups (mean differences 3.4 pg/ml), which corresponds to a reduction of 19% in exhaled 8-isoprostane increase in the budesonide group. However, we do not think that a mean difference of 3.4 pg/ml in the mean postexposure increases in exhaled 8-isoprostane between placebo and budesonide groups is biologically relevant. We conclude that pretreatment with a high dose of inhaled budesonide did not not affect ozone-induced increase in 8-isoprostane. We have previously shown that ozone-induced airway inflammation as reflected by increased sputum neutrophil counts and myeloperoxidase levels in sputum supernatant in healthy volunteers is resistant to pretreatment with inhaled budesonide. Other authors showed a protective effect of inhaled beclomethasone on 8-isoprostane increase in BAL fluid induced by allergen-challenge in asthma patients. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess airway inflammation following ozone exposure. The study compares the levels of exhaled 8-isoprostane between groups treated with inhaled corticosteroids and a placebo, indicating that exhalation is a method for evaluating the effects of these treatments on inflammatory markers in the respiratory system. However, the relationship is primarily focused on measurement rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed in the context of exhalation, specifically in exhaled breath condensate. While they are related through the measurement of inflammatory markers, the context does not delve deeply into their functional relationship.",
