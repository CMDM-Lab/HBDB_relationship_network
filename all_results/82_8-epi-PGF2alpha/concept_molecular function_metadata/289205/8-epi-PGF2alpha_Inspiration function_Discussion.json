    "context": "In fact, in our study sputum neutrophil increase after ozone exposure was resistant to inhaled budesonide, whereas in another study allergen-challenge-induced increase in eosinophil influx in the lung and the production of inflammatory mediators such as leukotriene B4 were reduced by corticosteroids. However, we did not find any correlation between 8-isoprostane concentrations and the different cell types in sputum, and we were unable to ascertain the cellular source of 8-isoprostane for which bioptic studies are required. Different time points for 8-isoprostane measurements (4 h vs. 24 h) and biological fluid (EBC vs. BAL fluid) might contribute to explaining this discrepancy. In conclusion, we have shown that short-term ozone exposure causes an acute increase in lung oxidative stress as reflected by 8-isoprostane concentrations in breath condensate and that this increase is resistant to pretreatment with a high dose of inhaled budesonide.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a marker of oxidative stress in the lungs following ozone exposure, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with inspiration function. The study focuses on inflammatory responses and cellular changes in the lungs, without establishing how 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels might influence or correlate with the mechanics of inspiration or lung function. Thus, while both terms are relevant to respiratory health, their connection is not explicitly defined.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 8-epi-PGF2alpha and inspiration function pertain to lung health, but the context does not provide a detailed relationship or interaction between them.",
