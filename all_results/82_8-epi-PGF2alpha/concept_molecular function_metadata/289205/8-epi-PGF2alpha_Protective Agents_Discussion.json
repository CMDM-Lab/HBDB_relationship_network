    "context": "However, we do not think that a mean difference of 3.4 pg/ml in the mean postexposure increases in exhaled 8-isoprostane between placebo and budesonide groups is biologically relevant. We conclude that pretreatment with a high dose of inhaled budesonide did not not affect ozone-induced increase in 8-isoprostane. We have previously shown that ozone-induced airway inflammation as reflected by increased sputum neutrophil counts and myeloperoxidase levels in sputum supernatant in healthy volunteers is resistant to pretreatment with inhaled budesonide. Other authors showed a protective effect of inhaled beclomethasone on 8-isoprostane increase in BAL fluid induced by allergen-challenge in asthma patients. Selective effects of corticosteroids on the cell types primarily responsible for 8-isoprostane synthesis in the airways could explain this discrepancy. Different oxidant stimuli may be responsible for a selective recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways and these cell types may show a different response to inhaled corticosteroids. In fact, in our study sputum neutrophil increase after ozone exposure was resistant to inhaled budesonide, whereas in another study allergen-challenge-induced increase in eosinophil influx in the lung and the production of inflammatory mediators such as leukotriene B4 were reduced by corticosteroids.

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a marker of oxidative stress and airway inflammation, particularly in response to ozone exposure. Protective agents, such as inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide and beclomethasone, are discussed in relation to their effects on 8-isoprostane levels, which are related to 8-epi-PGF2alpha. The study indicates that while some corticosteroids may have protective effects against inflammatory responses, the specific impact on 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels remains unclear, suggesting a complex interaction between these agents and oxidative stress markers in the airways.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, while protective agents like corticosteroids are discussed in terms of their effects on related inflammatory markers. However, the direct relationship between them is not thoroughly established.",
