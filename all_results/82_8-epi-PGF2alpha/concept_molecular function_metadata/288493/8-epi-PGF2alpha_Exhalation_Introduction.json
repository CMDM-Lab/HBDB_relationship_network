    "context": "Several indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, including pH, 8-isoprostane, and cytokines have been measured in exhaled breath condensate. These indicators differ between asthmatics and nonasthmatics and change acutely upon asthma exacerbation or treatment with asthma medication (Antus et al., 2010; Baraldi et al., 2003; Hunt et al., 2000; Montuschi et al., 2006). As biological markers of lung responses, analysis of these biomarkers may provide insight into diesel exhaust particle mechanisms of action and serve to link findings between experimental and epidemiologic studies. To improve understanding of the association between short-term exposure to ambient diesel exhaust particles and respiratory morbidity, we conducted a panel study involving continuous monitoring of black carbon outside two New York City high schools and measurement of pH and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate collected twice a week from students with and without asthma. Observations that ambient black carbon concentrations are associated with diesel exhaust particle concentrations and volume of diesel traffic but not car traffic support the measurement of black carbon as an indicator of diesel exhaust particles (Patel et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2007). We hypothesized that short-term increases in ambient black carbon would be associated with decreases in exhaled breath condensate pH, reflecting increases in airway inflammation, and with increases in 8-isoprostane, reflecting increases in airway oxidative stress. Further, we hypothesized that the associations between black carbon and exhaled biomarkers would differ between asthmatic and nonasthmatic adolescents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to exhalation through its role as a biomarker of oxidative stress measured in exhaled breath condensate. The study investigates how indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, including 8-isoprostane (a type of isoprostane like 8-epi-PGF2alpha), change in response to diesel exhaust exposure in asthmatic and nonasthmatic individuals. This suggests that exhalation can serve as a noninvasive method to assess lung responses to environmental stressors.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 8-epi-PGF2alpha is part of the broader analysis of biomarkers in exhaled breath, indicating its significance in assessing oxidative stress related to airway inflammation, but the specific relationship is not deeply explored.",
        "score": 3
