    "context": "Previous studies conducted in adults exposed in occupational 6 settings or to ambient particulate have suggested that malondialdehyde may be a good indicator of the oxidative potential of air pollutants. 25 Higher malondialdehyde levels has been observed in the serum of women exposed to high levels of particulate matter related to burning biomass fuel. 26 Malondialdehyde in the plasma of cement plant workers was negatively correlated with FEV1 and erythrocyte reduced glutathione. 4 High levels of malondialdehyde have also been observed in the EBC of workers exposed to cobalt and tungsten. 6 Diesel-exposed toll collectors have been reported to have significantly higher plasma malondialdehyde and nitrite+nitrate levels than office workers, suggesting that malondialdehyde and nitrite+nitrate levels may be used as biological markers of oxidative stress related to diesel exhaust exposure. 5 Although malondialdehyde is not a specific product of lipid peroxidation and the reliability of using malondialdehyde as a marker of oxidative stress in\u00a0vivo has been questioned, 27 with the advent of sensitive techniques measuring malondialdehyde with HPLC separation and fluorescence detection, 7,9,28,29 such as used in the current study, reliable data have been obtained. Although malondialdehyde represents only approximately 1% of lipid peroxides, it can be used as a marker of oxidative stress in clinical settings. ",

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde is highlighted as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress, particularly in workers exposed to various pollutants, including tungsten. Elevated levels of malondialdehyde have been observed in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of individuals exposed to tungsten, indicating a relationship between tungsten exposure and oxidative stress as measured by malondialdehyde levels. This suggests that tungsten may contribute to oxidative damage, which is reflected in increased malondialdehyde concentrations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between malondialdehyde and tungsten, as the context provides evidence of elevated malondialdehyde levels in workers exposed to tungsten, indicating a clear relationship in the context of oxidative stress.",
        "score": 4
