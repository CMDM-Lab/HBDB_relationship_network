    "context": "23,24 Thus, a biomarker of effect\u2014that is, one that becomes positive once the oxidant stimulus exceeds the lung's antioxidant defenses and ROS are available to cause oxidative stress injury\u2014is attractive. In the current study, malondialdehyde could not be detected in 24.8% of EBC samples. One plausible explanation for this is that the pollutant exposure in these children on these occasions was not sufficient to overwhelm their antioxidant defenses. An interesting point is that we were able to show by using repeated measurements of malondialdehyde levels in 107 children with asthma that malondialdehyde levels varied with exposure to air pollutants, in particular ozone and PM2.5. This supports the fact that malondialdehyde levels are at least in part related to pollutant exposure. To be a confounding, any other factor would have to vary closely with air pollution exposure and affect malondialdehyde levels. The accepted mechanism by which exposure to traffic-related pollutants is thought to adversely affect health is by inducing oxidative stress. ",

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde is presented as a biomarker of oxidative stress that varies with exposure to air pollutants, particularly ozone and PM2.5. The study indicates that malondialdehyde levels can reflect the extent of oxidative stress injury caused by pollutants, suggesting a direct relationship between ozone exposure and increased malondialdehyde levels in children with asthma. This connection highlights the role of ozone as a significant contributor to oxidative stress and its potential health impacts.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between malondialdehyde and ozone, supported by evidence that malondialdehyde levels vary with ozone exposure, indicating a clear relationship in the context of oxidative stress and health effects.",
