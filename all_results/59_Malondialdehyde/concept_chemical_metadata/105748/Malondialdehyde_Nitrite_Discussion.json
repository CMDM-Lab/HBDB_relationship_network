    "context": "25 Higher malondialdehyde levels has been observed in the serum of women exposed to high levels of particulate matter related to burning biomass fuel. 26 Malondialdehyde in the plasma of cement plant workers was negatively correlated with FEV1 and erythrocyte reduced glutathione. 4 High levels of malondialdehyde have also been observed in the EBC of workers exposed to cobalt and tungsten. 6 Diesel-exposed toll collectors have been reported to have significantly higher plasma malondialdehyde and nitrite+nitrate levels than office workers, suggesting that malondialdehyde and nitrite+nitrate levels may be used as biological markers of oxidative stress related to diesel exhaust exposure. 5 Although malondialdehyde is not a specific product of lipid peroxidation and the reliability of using malondialdehyde as a marker of oxidative stress in\u00a0vivo has been questioned, 27 with the advent of sensitive techniques measuring malondialdehyde with HPLC separation and fluorescence detection, 7,9,28,29 such as used in the current study, reliable data have been obtained. Although malondialdehyde represents only approximately 1% of lipid peroxides, it can be used as a marker of oxidative stress in clinical settings. 7,26,29 A recent study comparing children with asthma and control children reported detectable levels of malondialdehyde and erythrocyte reduced glutathione in exhaled breath in the children with asthma that increased during asthma exacerbation.

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde and nitrite are both mentioned as biological markers of oxidative stress, particularly in relation to exposure to diesel exhaust. The study indicates that higher levels of malondialdehyde were observed alongside increased nitrite+nitrate levels in workers exposed to diesel, suggesting a potential relationship where both compounds may reflect oxidative damage and stress in the body due to environmental pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between malondialdehyde and nitrite, as both are implicated as markers of oxidative stress in the same context. The evidence presented indicates a correlation between their levels in response to environmental exposure, supporting their relevance in assessing oxidative damage.",
