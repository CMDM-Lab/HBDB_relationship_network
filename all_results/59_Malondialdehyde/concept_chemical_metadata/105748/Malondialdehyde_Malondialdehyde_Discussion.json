    "context": "Because our study population was recruited from an allergy clinic, the rate of atopy was high. Our results therefore can only be extrapolated to a similar population. In summary, the data from the current study have shown that malondialdehyde levels in EBC can be used as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related pollutants and that increased malondialdehyde levels are associated with lower lung function and increased secretion of IL-8 in the nose. To our knowledge, our study is the first that evaluates the use of malondialdehyde in exhaled breath as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related air pollutants in a free living population of children with asthma. This marker of oxidative stress might be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies of air pollution conducted in susceptible children such as patients with asthma. In Great Britain (GB), many activities/occupations can involve the use of chemicals considered hazardous to worker health. It is important that exposure to chemicals which are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and sensitisers be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable as stated in legislation (Health & Safety Executive (HSE), 2013a).

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is highlighted as a biomarker for oxidative stress related to traffic-related pollutants, particularly in children with asthma. The study demonstrates that elevated MDA levels correlate with reduced lung function and increased IL-8 secretion, indicating its potential utility in epidemiological studies of air pollution effects on respiratory health. The focus on MDA emphasizes its significance in assessing the impact of environmental factors on health outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship, as malondialdehyde is both the subject of study and a key biomarker for assessing the effects of pollutants on lung function and inflammation in asthma patients. The context provides strong evidence for its relevance.",
