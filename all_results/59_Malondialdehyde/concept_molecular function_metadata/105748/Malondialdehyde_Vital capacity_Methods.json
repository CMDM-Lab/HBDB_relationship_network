    "context": "Other variables such as age, outdoor activities, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (smoking at home of the father and mother and number of cigarettes smoked) were not significant confounders and were not included in the final models. In models including traffic count, we also account for the distance between the home and the traffic count device located on the main avenue closest to the home. We also evaluated the potential modifying effect of asthma severity on the relationship between pollutant exposure and malondialdehyde levels. Association of malondialdehyde levels with health outcomes Generalized estimating equation models were used to study the association between malondialdehyde levels and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC] and FEV1) and IL-8 levels in nasal lavage. We also calculated the predicted FEV1 and FVC using the equation proposed by Per\u00e9z-Padilla et al 14 for Mexican children and calculated the association between malondialdehyde levels and changes in FEV1% and FVC%. IL-8 levels were not normally distributed and were log-transformed. Models were adjusted for sex, body mass index, and chronological time when studying lung function and for sex and chronological time only in models including IL-8 given that body mass index was not significantly related to IL-8 levels.

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde levels are evaluated in relation to pulmonary function, specifically forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1. The study employs generalized estimating equation models to assess the association between malondialdehyde and these measures of lung function, indicating a potential link between oxidative stress (as indicated by malondialdehyde) and respiratory health outcomes. However, the specific nature of this relationship is not fully detailed, focusing instead on statistical associations.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as malondialdehyde is analyzed in relation to vital capacity measures, suggesting a connection between oxidative stress and lung function. However, the context does not provide extensive details on the mechanisms or direct interactions.",
