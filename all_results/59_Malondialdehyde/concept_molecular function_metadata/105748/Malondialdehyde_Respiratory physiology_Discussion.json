    "context": "respectively). Because our study population was recruited from an allergy clinic, the rate of atopy was high. Our results therefore can only be extrapolated to a similar population. In summary, the data from the current study have shown that malondialdehyde levels in EBC can be used as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related pollutants and that increased malondialdehyde levels are associated with lower lung function and increased secretion of IL-8 in the nose. To our knowledge, our study is the first that evaluates the use of malondialdehyde in exhaled breath as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related air pollutants in a free living population of children with asthma. This marker of oxidative stress might be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies of air pollution conducted in susceptible children such as patients with asthma. In Great Britain (GB), many activities/occupations can involve the use of chemicals considered hazardous to worker health. ",

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker for oxidative stress related to traffic-related pollutants, which negatively impacts respiratory physiology, particularly lung function in children with asthma. The study highlights the association between elevated MDA levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and decreased lung function, indicating its potential role in assessing respiratory health in polluted environments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between malondialdehyde and respiratory physiology, as the study provides evidence that increased MDA levels correlate with lower lung function and inflammation, indicating its relevance in respiratory health assessments.",
