    "context": "Because our study population was recruited from an allergy clinic, the rate of atopy was high. Our results therefore can only be extrapolated to a similar population. In summary, the data from the current study have shown that malondialdehyde levels in EBC can be used as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related pollutants and that increased malondialdehyde levels are associated with lower lung function and increased secretion of IL-8 in the nose. To our knowledge, our study is the first that evaluates the use of malondialdehyde in exhaled breath as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related air pollutants in a free living population of children with asthma. This marker of oxidative stress might be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies of air pollution conducted in susceptible children such as patients with asthma. In Great Britain (GB), many activities/occupations can involve the use of chemicals considered hazardous to worker health. It is important that exposure to chemicals which are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and sensitisers be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable as stated in legislation (Health & Safety Executive (HSE), 2013a).

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess the effects of traffic-related pollutants on lung function in children with asthma. The study highlights the association between elevated MDA levels and decreased lung function, indicating that exhalation of MDA can reflect oxidative stress due to environmental exposures. This suggests a significant relationship between MDA and exhalation as a means of monitoring respiratory health in susceptible populations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between malondialdehyde and exhalation, as MDA is specifically measured in exhaled breath to evaluate its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress related to air pollution, supported by evidence of its association with lung function.",
        "score": 4
