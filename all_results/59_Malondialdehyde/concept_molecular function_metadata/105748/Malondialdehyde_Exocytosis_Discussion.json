    "context": "respectively). Because our study population was recruited from an allergy clinic, the rate of atopy was high. Our results therefore can only be extrapolated to a similar population. In summary, the data from the current study have shown that malondialdehyde levels in EBC can be used as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related pollutants and that increased malondialdehyde levels are associated with lower lung function and increased secretion of IL-8 in the nose. To our knowledge, our study is the first that evaluates the use of malondialdehyde in exhaled breath as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related air pollutants in a free living population of children with asthma. This marker of oxidative stress might be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies of air pollution conducted in susceptible children such as patients with asthma. In Great Britain (GB), many activities/occupations can involve the use of chemicals considered hazardous to worker health. ",

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker of oxidative stress associated with traffic-related pollutants, particularly in children with asthma. While the study highlights the role of MDA in lung function and inflammation (e.g., IL-8 secretion), it does not explicitly connect MDA to exocytosis. Exocytosis, a cellular process for releasing substances, may be indirectly related to the inflammatory response but is not directly discussed in relation to MDA in this study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both malondialdehyde and exocytosis are involved in cellular responses to oxidative stress and inflammation, but their specific relationship is not detailed in the context provided.",
