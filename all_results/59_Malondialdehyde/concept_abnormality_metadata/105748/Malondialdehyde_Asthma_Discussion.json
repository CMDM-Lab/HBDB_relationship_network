    "context": "Because our study population was recruited from an allergy clinic, the rate of atopy was high. Our results therefore can only be extrapolated to a similar population. In summary, the data from the current study have shown that malondialdehyde levels in EBC can be used as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related pollutants and that increased malondialdehyde levels are associated with lower lung function and increased secretion of IL-8 in the nose. To our knowledge, our study is the first that evaluates the use of malondialdehyde in exhaled breath as a biomarker of effect of traffic-related air pollutants in a free living population of children with asthma. This marker of oxidative stress might be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies of air pollution conducted in susceptible children such as patients with asthma. In Great Britain (GB), many activities/occupations can involve the use of chemicals considered hazardous to worker health. It is important that exposure to chemicals which are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and sensitisers be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable as stated in legislation (Health & Safety Executive (HSE), 2013a).

        "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker of oxidative stress associated with traffic-related pollutants, particularly in children with asthma. The study highlights that increased MDA levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) correlate with lower lung function and elevated IL-8 secretion, suggesting that MDA may serve as a useful tool for assessing the impact of air pollution on asthma patients. This indicates a significant relationship between MDA and asthma, particularly in the context of environmental exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between malondialdehyde and asthma, supported by evidence that MDA levels correlate with lung function and inflammatory markers in asthmatic children. The study emphasizes MDA's potential as a biomarker for assessing the effects of air pollution on asthma, indicating a significant relationship.",
