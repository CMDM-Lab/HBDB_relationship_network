    "context": "[2] Symptoms, lung function abnormalities and average lung function values differed by exposure. [3] These differences could not be explained by age, smoking status or employment at another flavouring plant, suggesting that they reflect outcomes of occupational exposures at the facility. [4] These findings are most consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis in this workforce and indicate that further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Objectives: Four diacetyl workers were found to have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. [2] Exposures, respiratory symptoms, lung function and exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationships were investigated. [1] Methods: 175 workers from a plant producing diacetyl between 1960 and 2003 were investigated. [2] Exposure data were used to model diacetyl exposure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is directly linked to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans among workers exposed to this flavoring chemical. The study indicates that symptoms and lung function abnormalities observed in the workforce are consistent with undiagnosed bronchiolitis obliterans, highlighting the need for reduced exposure to diacetyl and its substitutes to prevent respiratory diseases.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and bronchiolitis obliterans, as the context explicitly connects occupational exposure to diacetyl with the onset of this serious lung condition, supported by evidence from the study.",
        "score": 5
