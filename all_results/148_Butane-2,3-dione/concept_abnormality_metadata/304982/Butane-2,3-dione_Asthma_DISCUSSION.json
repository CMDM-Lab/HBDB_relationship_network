    "context": "[2] We did not correct for socio-economic status and educational level, which were around the average for the Dutch workforce. [3] Theoretically there could be a cohort effect but practically this is expected to be marginal for a period of less than 15 years. [1] Persistence of symptoms despite plant closure that differ among groups is consistent with permanent injury. [2] The marginally significant finding of work-related wheezing in the last year in operators is compatible with asthma, and many have high adjusted prevalence ratios despite low power to detect differences. [3] With asthma as a possible outcome, as shown in a NIOSH health hazard evaluation report of a popcorn plant, one would not necessarily expect pulmonary function abnormalities. [1] Three robust results support the previous finding that diacetyl is an occupational hazard: (1) the highest exposed group, the process operators, had significantly more respiratory symptoms than other occupational groups, and the plant population as a whole had excess symptoms compared to the general population; (2) a previously published spirometric analysis internal to the cohort showed that process operators had a job title-related decrement in FEV1 (\u00e2\u02c6\u2019292 ml); and (3) all severe BOS cases occurred in process operators. [2] In addition to these robust findings, our analyses confirm (marginally) significant excesses of respiratory symptoms in diacetyl workers (from table 2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to respiratory symptoms, including asthma, among workers exposed to it in a popcorn plant. The study indicates that process operators exposed to diacetyl exhibited significantly more respiratory symptoms and a decrease in pulmonary function, suggesting a potential occupational hazard related to asthma. The findings highlight a concerning relationship between diacetyl exposure and respiratory health outcomes, including asthma-like symptoms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and asthma, supported by evidence of increased respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function in exposed workers. The context provides robust findings indicating that diacetyl exposure is associated with asthma, although further details on the mechanisms are not provided.",
