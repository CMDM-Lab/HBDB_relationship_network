    "context": "[3] Lung function and questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms were compared to a general population sample and respiratory symptoms to an internal reference group. [1] Results: Workers were potentially exposed to acetoin, diacetyl, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. [2] Historic diacetyl exposure ranged from 1.8 to 351 mg/m3, and from 3 to 396 mg/m3 for specific tasks. [3] Diacetyl workers reported significantly more respiratory symptoms compared to the general population sample (continuous trouble with breathing (prevalence ratio (PR)\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1), daily cough (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1), asthma attack (ever) (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4), doctor diagnosed asthma (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) and asthma attack in the last year (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01604.7; 95% CI 1.9 to 11.4)) and to a minimally exposed internal reference group (ever trouble with breathing (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 7.0) and work-related shortness of breath in the last year (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01607.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 52.9)). [4] Lung function did not differ between groups. [5] A positive relationship between exposure and FEV1 was found. [1] Conclusion: The excess of respiratory symptoms in this retrospective cohort suggests that diacetyl production poses an occupational hazard. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to respiratory symptoms among workers exposed to it. The study reports a significant increase in the prevalence of asthma attacks among diacetyl workers compared to both the general population and minimally exposed internal reference groups. This suggests a direct association between diacetyl exposure and the incidence of asthma attacks, highlighting its potential as an occupational hazard.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between Butane-2,3-dione and asthma attacks, supported by statistical data showing increased prevalence ratios for respiratory symptoms, including asthma attacks, among exposed workers. This indicates a significant health risk associated with diacetyl exposure.",
