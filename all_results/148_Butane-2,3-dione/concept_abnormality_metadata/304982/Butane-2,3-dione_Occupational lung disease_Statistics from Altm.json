[2] Diacetyl, a predominant chemical in butter flavouring, is suggested to play a prominent role.\u00e2\u20ac\u201c [1] In the index plant, an exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship was reported between cumulative exposure to diacetyl (using quartiles of increasing exposure) and the proportion of workers with abnormal spirometric lung function results including airway obstruction. [2] Analyses of aggregated data of current workforces in the microwave popcorn industry indicated a widespread risk for occupational lung disease from exposure to butter-flavouring chemicals. [3] Workers mixing oil and butter flavourings had medical findings consistent with BOS and workers with more than 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mixing experience had a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction and lower mean per cent predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) compared with workers who had less than 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience, indicating a relationship with exposure. [1] We performed a cross-sectional study in 2005 in a cohort of former workers in a chemical plant producing diacetyl in The Netherlands in the period 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2003.

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is directly linked to occupational lung disease, specifically bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), commonly referred to as 'popcorn worker's lung.' The text discusses the exposure-response relationship between cumulative diacetyl exposure and abnormal lung function among workers in the microwave popcorn industry, indicating a significant health risk associated with inhalation of this chemical. The findings highlight the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction in workers exposed to diacetyl, establishing a clear connection between the chemical and occupational lung disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and occupational lung disease, supported by evidence of exposure-response relationships and specific health outcomes in affected workers. The context emphasizes the significant health risks posed by diacetyl exposure in the workplace.",
        "score": 5
