    "context": "[2] Limited historical exposure data did not support a quantitative individual diacetyl exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship, but our findings suggest that preventive measures are prudent. [1] Fixed airway obstruction consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popcorn worker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lung\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) was first reported among workers in the microwave popcorn production industry in relation to inhalatory exposure to airborne butter-flavouring chemicals. [2] Diacetyl, a predominant chemical in butter flavouring, is suggested to play a prominent role.\u00e2\u20ac\u201c [1] In the index plant, an exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship was reported between cumulative exposure to diacetyl (using quartiles of increasing exposure) and the proportion of workers with abnormal spirometric lung function results including airway obstruction. [2] Analyses of aggregated data of current workforces in the microwave popcorn industry indicated a widespread risk for occupational lung disease from exposure to butter-flavouring chemicals. [3] Workers mixing oil and butter flavourings had medical findings consistent with BOS and workers with more than 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mixing experience had a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction and lower mean per cent predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) compared with workers who had less than 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience, indicating a relationship with exposure. [1] We performed a cross-sectional study in 2005 in a cohort of former workers in a chemical plant producing diacetyl in The Netherlands in the period 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2003. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to airway obstruction through its role as a predominant chemical in butter flavoring, which has been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in workers exposed to it. The study indicates a clear exposure-response relationship, where higher cumulative exposure to diacetyl correlates with increased prevalence of abnormal lung function and respiratory symptoms, including airway obstruction. This suggests that diacetyl exposure is a significant risk factor for developing airway obstruction in affected workers.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and airway obstruction, supported by evidence of an exposure-response relationship and specific health outcomes in workers exposed to diacetyl. The context clearly establishes diacetyl's role in occupational lung disease.",
