        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly mentioned in relation to chronic bronchitis. The study discusses participants' diagnoses of chronic bronchitis and other respiratory conditions, but there is no specific mention of Butane-2,3-dione's role or impact on bronchitis. The connection between the two terms is absent, indicating a lack of direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that Butane-2,3-dione and chronic bronchitis are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion or evidence of a relationship between them. They appear coincidentally without any direct relevance.",
