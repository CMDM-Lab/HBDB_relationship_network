    "context": "[1] Among current flavouring manufacturing workers, some symptoms and diagnoses were more common than expected, while spirometric abnormalities were not in excess. [2] Symptoms, lung function abnormalities and average lung function values differed by exposure. [3] These differences could not be explained by age, smoking status or employment at another flavouring plant, suggesting that they reflect outcomes of occupational exposures at the facility. [4] These findings are most consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis in this workforce and indicate that further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Objectives: Four diacetyl workers were found to have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. [2] Exposures, respiratory symptoms, lung function and exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationships were investigated. [1] Methods: 175 workers from a plant producing diacetyl between 1960 and 2003 were investigated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is directly linked to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans among workers in a flavoring manufacturing facility. The study indicates that exposure to diacetyl is associated with respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, with specific cases of bronchiolitis obliterans identified among workers. This suggests a significant occupational health risk related to diacetyl exposure, warranting further investigation and preventive measures.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and bronchiolitis obliterans, as the context explicitly connects diacetyl exposure to the diagnosis of this serious respiratory condition in workers, highlighting a critical occupational health concern.",
        "score": 5
