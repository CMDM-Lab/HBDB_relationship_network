    "context": "[6] Our measurements, although limited, highlight what appears to be an ongoing shift in the flavouring manufacturing industry away from diacetyl and towards chemically related substitutes that may have comparable toxicity. [7] , , Until the safety of diacetyl substitutes has been established, these flavouring chemicals should be considered to be respiratory toxins and handled using the same controls in place for diacetyl. [1] Little is known about the respiratory toxicity of the many flavouring chemicals other than diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione used at the facility. [2] It is certainly possible that we detected not only a spectrum of physiological findings of one flavouring-related disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, but also a spectrum of flavouring-related lung diseases. [3] In addition to obliterative bronchiolitis, our findings could indicate risk of emphysema (obstruction and low diffusing capacity) and/or interstitial lung disease (restriction and low diffusing capacity). [4] Despite predominantly fixed obstruction, the reported work-related pattern of some symptoms also raises the possibility of occupational or work-exacerbated asthma. [5] , , Ultimately, distinguishing among these diagnoses would require additional evaluation, including chest imaging, bronchoprovocation testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and lung biopsy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned as a chemically related substitute to diacetyl, which is known to be a respiratory toxin linked to obliterative bronchiolitis. The text suggests that flavoring chemicals, including Butane-2,3-dione, should be treated with caution due to potential respiratory toxicity, indicating a possible association with bronchiolitis obliterans and other lung diseases. However, the specific relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and bronchiolitis obliterans is not explicitly detailed, leaving the connection somewhat implied rather than directly established.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is associated with respiratory toxicity and mentioned in the context of obliterative bronchiolitis. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and the connection remains somewhat indirect.",
