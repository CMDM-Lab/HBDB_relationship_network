    "context": "[6] Our measurements, although limited, highlight what appears to be an ongoing shift in the flavouring manufacturing industry away from diacetyl and towards chemically related substitutes that may have comparable toxicity. [7] , , Until the safety of diacetyl substitutes has been established, these flavouring chemicals should be considered to be respiratory toxins and handled using the same controls in place for diacetyl. [1] Little is known about the respiratory toxicity of the many flavouring chemicals other than diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione used at the facility. [2] It is certainly possible that we detected not only a spectrum of physiological findings of one flavouring-related disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, but also a spectrum of flavouring-related lung diseases. [3] In addition to obliterative bronchiolitis, our findings could indicate risk of emphysema (obstruction and low diffusing capacity) and/or interstitial lung disease (restriction and low diffusing capacity). [4] Despite predominantly fixed obstruction, the reported work-related pattern of some symptoms also raises the possibility of occupational or work-exacerbated asthma. [5] , , Ultimately, distinguishing among these diagnoses would require additional evaluation, including chest imaging, bronchoprovocation testing, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and lung biopsy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is indirectly related to lung diseases through its classification as a flavoring chemical that may pose respiratory toxicity risks similar to diacetyl. The text discusses potential respiratory diseases, including obliterative bronchiolitis and emphysema, associated with exposure to flavoring agents, suggesting that Butane-2,3-dione could contribute to similar lung health issues. However, the specific impact of Butane-2,3-dione on lung diseases is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned in the context of respiratory toxicity and potential lung diseases, but the relationship is not deeply explored or quantified.",
