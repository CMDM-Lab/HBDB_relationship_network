    "context": "[1] Far less is known about the respiratory toxicity of other diacetyl substitutes or the multitude of other flavouring chemicals currently in use. [2] Two cases of obliterative bronchiolitis in California flavouring manufacturing workers prompted industry-wide state surveillance that identified other probable cases and abnormal declines in the forced expiratory volume in 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2026s (FEV1) on longitudinal spirometry. [3] , An investigation at an Indiana flavouring manufacturing facility found an excess of spirometric restriction cross-sectionally and flavouring-related abnormal declines in FEV1 longitudinally. [4] The finding of spirometric restriction could be consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis from diacetyl or it could represent distinct pathological effects of other exposures. [1] To better understand the spectrum of respiratory health in flavouring manufacturing workers, we conducted a cross-sectional study at a large flavouring manufacturing facility where obliterative bronchiolitis reportedly had been diagnosed in two former workers. [2] Since the facility opened in 1998, the use of diacetyl reportedly had declined and the use of substitutes had increased. [3] Neither air sampling conducted by consultants to the facility in 2008 nor our own air sampling in 2011 detected diacetyl, although we did detect 2,3-pentanedione. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned as a substitute for diacetyl, a compound linked to respiratory toxicity, specifically obliterative bronchiolitis in flavoring manufacturing workers. The study highlights cases of bronchiolitis obliterans associated with flavoring chemicals, suggesting a potential relationship between exposure to Butane-2,3-dione and respiratory health issues, although the direct impact of Butane-2,3-dione on bronchiolitis obliterans is not explicitly established.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is implicated in the context of respiratory toxicity related to bronchiolitis obliterans, but the specific effects of Butane-2,3-dione on this condition are not thoroughly detailed.",
