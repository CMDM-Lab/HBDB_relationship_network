    "context": "The concentration of Pseudomonas spp. remained below 6logCFU/g (Fig. 1e) and concentration of Enterobacteriaceae below 5logCFU/g in the four bulk samples of pork (Fig. 1d). To our surprise, Loin P, Collar P, Loin W and Collar W contained microbes which formed bioluminescent colonies on L&H agar. The microbial cells in the bioluminescent colonies were large, 2 to 4\u03bcm in diameter, and resembled P. phosphoreum. P. phosphoreum-like cells were also detected by direct microscopy of meat homogenates at the time of sensory spoilage. According to microscopic counting, they composed from 4% to 18% of the total number of microbial cells (mainly rods and cocci). Thus, P. phosphoreum-like bacteria were part of the predominating microbiota in the four bulk pork samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly mentioned or linked to bioluminescence. The focus is on the presence of bioluminescent colonies formed by Pseudomonas phosphoreum-like bacteria in pork samples. While Butane-2,3-dione may be relevant in other biochemical contexts, its relationship to bioluminescence in this specific study is not established or discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and bioluminescence in the provided context. They are mentioned separately without any connection.",
