    "context": "The following are the supplementary data related to this article. Supplementary Table 1 Instructions for sensory evaluation of fresh modified-atmosphere packaged meat. Supplementary Fig. 1 Phylogenetic tree based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of five pork isolates from this study and type and reference sequences obtained from the ribosomal data base project database (1). The evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA method (2). The optimal tree with the sum of branch length=0.21308821 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method (3) and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly related to the concept of evolution. The mention of evolutionary history pertains to the phylogenetic analysis of pork isolates based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, which does not involve Butane-2,3-dione. The focus is on evolutionary distances and tree construction rather than any biochemical or metabolic implications of Butane-2,3-dione.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and evolution, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct interaction or relevance.",
