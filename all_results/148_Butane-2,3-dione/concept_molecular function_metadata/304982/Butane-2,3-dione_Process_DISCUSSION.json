    "context": "[2] Potentially, there may have been some confounding by exposure to other agents. [3] Most workers have at some point in time been exposed to several other chemicals including irritants such as ammonia and chlorine. [4] Confounding exposures were not considered relevant for the four cases of BOS which we described earlier. [1] In conclusion, this epidemiological study supports the finding that the production of diacetyl presents a respiratory hazard in the plant where four cases of severe BOS were found and indicates a process associated risk. [2] A cumulative diacetyl exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship could not be demonstrated or did not exist. [3] The job title-related risk suggests that further attention should be given to peak exposures and to host factors among the susceptible in high-risk jobs. [4] The research on diacetyl-exposed populations to date suggests that preventive measures should be taken. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to a specific process associated with respiratory hazards in a workplace setting. The study highlights the risks of diacetyl exposure, particularly in relation to the production process that may lead to severe cases of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The mention of a process indicates that the handling or production of diacetyl is critical to understanding the associated health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and the process of its production, as the context discusses the respiratory hazards linked to diacetyl exposure in a specific occupational setting, supported by epidemiological findings.",
        "score": 4
