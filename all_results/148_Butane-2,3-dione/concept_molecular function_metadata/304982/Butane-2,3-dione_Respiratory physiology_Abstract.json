    "context": "[3] These differences could not be explained by age, smoking status or employment at another flavouring plant, suggesting that they reflect outcomes of occupational exposures at the facility. [4] These findings are most consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis in this workforce and indicate that further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Objectives: Four diacetyl workers were found to have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. [2] Exposures, respiratory symptoms, lung function and exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationships were investigated. [1] Methods: 175 workers from a plant producing diacetyl between 1960 and 2003 were investigated. [2] Exposure data were used to model diacetyl exposure. [3] Lung function and questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms were compared to a general population sample and respiratory symptoms to an internal reference group. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to respiratory physiology through its association with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome observed in workers exposed to this flavoring chemical. The study investigates the respiratory symptoms and lung function of workers, indicating that diacetyl exposure may lead to significant respiratory health issues, highlighting the need for reduced exposure to such chemicals in occupational settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and respiratory physiology, as the context discusses the health impacts of diacetyl exposure on lung function and respiratory symptoms, supported by evidence from the study of affected workers.",
        "score": 4
