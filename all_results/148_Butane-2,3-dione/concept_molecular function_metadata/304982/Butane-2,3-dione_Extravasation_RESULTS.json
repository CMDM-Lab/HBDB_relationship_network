    "context": "[5] Laboratory workers were potentially exposed but no further qualitative or quantitative information was available. [6] Workers in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d (transport, health and safety, management, and research and development) had low exposure potential for diacetyl and, if they were exposed, it was always for a short time. [1] Exposure incidents (ever) were reported by 74/95 operators (78%), 11/18 technical service workers (61%), 6/11 quality laboratory workers (35%) and 15/28 of the internal reference group (54%). [2] Operators reported significantly more exposure incidents (mostly spills and leakages) compared with the minimally exposed internal reference group (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601.5; 95% CI 1.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.1). [3] The occurrence of these exposure incidents was borderline significantly (p\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.06) associated with cough symptoms but not with any other respiratory symptom. [4] The association with cough disappeared after adjusting for smoking and age. [1] There was no clear association between FEV1 (% predicted) and exposure to diacetyl (fig 1). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to exposure incidents among laboratory workers, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with extravasation. The text primarily focuses on exposure incidents and respiratory symptoms without linking diacetyl to extravasation or detailing any physiological mechanisms that would connect the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and extravasation, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
