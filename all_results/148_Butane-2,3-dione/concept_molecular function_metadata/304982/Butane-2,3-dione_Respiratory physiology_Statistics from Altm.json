    "context": "[2] Limited historical exposure data did not support a quantitative individual diacetyl exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship, but our findings suggest that preventive measures are prudent. [1] Fixed airway obstruction consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popcorn worker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lung\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) was first reported among workers in the microwave popcorn production industry in relation to inhalatory exposure to airborne butter-flavouring chemicals. [2] Diacetyl, a predominant chemical in butter flavouring, is suggested to play a prominent role.\u00e2\u20ac\u201c [1] In the index plant, an exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship was reported between cumulative exposure to diacetyl (using quartiles of increasing exposure) and the proportion of workers with abnormal spirometric lung function results including airway obstruction. [2] Analyses of aggregated data of current workforces in the microwave popcorn industry indicated a widespread risk for occupational lung disease from exposure to butter-flavouring chemicals. [3] Workers mixing oil and butter flavourings had medical findings consistent with BOS and workers with more than 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mixing experience had a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction and lower mean per cent predicted FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) compared with workers who had less than 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience, indicating a relationship with exposure. [1] We performed a cross-sectional study in 2005 in a cohort of former workers in a chemical plant producing diacetyl in The Netherlands in the period 1960\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2003. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to respiratory physiology through its association with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), also known as 'popcorn worker's lung.' The study highlights the adverse effects of diacetyl exposure on lung function, particularly in workers exposed to butter-flavouring chemicals, indicating a clear relationship between diacetyl inhalation and respiratory health outcomes, including airway obstruction and reduced forced expiratory volume (FEV1).",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as diacetyl exposure is directly associated with significant respiratory health issues, supported by evidence of abnormal lung function and symptoms in affected workers. This establishes a critical link between Butane-2,3-dione and respiratory physiology.",
