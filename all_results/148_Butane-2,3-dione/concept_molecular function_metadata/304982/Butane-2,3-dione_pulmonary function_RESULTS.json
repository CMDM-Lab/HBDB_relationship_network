    "context": "[3] The occurrence of these exposure incidents was borderline significantly (p\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01600.06) associated with cough symptoms but not with any other respiratory symptom. [4] The association with cough disappeared after adjusting for smoking and age. [1] There was no clear association between FEV1 (% predicted) and exposure to diacetyl (fig 1). [2] Multiple linear regression analysis of pulmonary function variables on exposure in process operators (table 4) showed a significant increase in actual FEV1 of 28 ml per year for those working in the diacetyl plant before 1995 (95% CI 3 to 53) and a significant increase in FEV1 of 2 ml per cumulative weighted number of years worked in the diacetyl plant (95% CI 0 to 4). [1] During production of diacetyl, process operators were potentially exposed to acetoin, diacetyl, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. [2] Diacetyl levels ranged from 1.8 to 351 mg/m3 and acetaldehyde levels from 0.4 to 29 mg/m3. [3] Diacetyl exposure levels could not be evaluated in relation to an occupational standard as no Dutch occupational exposure limit (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153MAC value\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) or international equivalent is available.

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to pulmonary function, specifically regarding its exposure among process operators in a diacetyl plant. While there was a borderline significant association with cough symptoms, the analysis did not find a clear link between diacetyl exposure and forced expiratory volume (FEV1). The study indicates some increase in FEV1 among workers, but the relationship with diacetyl exposure remains inconclusive, suggesting that other factors may influence pulmonary function.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is linked to pulmonary function through exposure analysis, but the lack of a clear association with FEV1 limits the strength of their relationship.",
        "score": 3
