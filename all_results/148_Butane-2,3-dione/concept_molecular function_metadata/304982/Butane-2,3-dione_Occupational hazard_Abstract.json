    "context": "[3] Diacetyl workers reported significantly more respiratory symptoms compared to the general population sample (continuous trouble with breathing (prevalence ratio (PR)\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1), daily cough (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1), asthma attack (ever) (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4), doctor diagnosed asthma (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) and asthma attack in the last year (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01604.7; 95% CI 1.9 to 11.4)) and to a minimally exposed internal reference group (ever trouble with breathing (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 7.0) and work-related shortness of breath in the last year (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01607.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 52.9)). [4] Lung function did not differ between groups. [5] A positive relationship between exposure and FEV1 was found. [1] Conclusion: The excess of respiratory symptoms in this retrospective cohort suggests that diacetyl production poses an occupational hazard. [2] Limited historical exposure data did not support a quantitative individual diacetyl exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationship, but our findings suggest that preventive measures are prudent.

[2] Diacetyl, a predominant chemical in butter flavouring, is suggested to play a prominent role.\u00e2\u20ac\u201c ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is identified as a significant occupational hazard for workers exposed to it, particularly in the production of microwave popcorn. The study highlights a marked increase in respiratory symptoms among diacetyl workers compared to the general population, indicating a direct link between diacetyl exposure and adverse respiratory health outcomes, including asthma and chronic breathing issues. This establishes diacetyl as a critical occupational health risk.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and occupational hazards, as the context provides substantial evidence of respiratory health risks associated with diacetyl exposure in the workplace.",
        "score": 5
