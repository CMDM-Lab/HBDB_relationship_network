    "context": "[5] There were no associations between symptoms and history of work at another flavouring plant. [6] Furthermore, there were no significant associations between lung function abnormalities or mean lung function parameters and other exposure variables. [1] Associations between categorical health outcomes and exposure variables seen in simple analyses were evident in adjusted regression models (table 4). [2] Participants who spent \u00e2\u2030\u00a51\u00e2\u20ac\u2026h daily in production areas had significantly higher odds of work-related breathing trouble, usual phlegm and any spirometric abnormality. [3] These participants also had higher odds of asthma-like symptoms, usual cough and low diffusing capacity, although these associations did not reach statistical significance. [4] Participants with tenure \u00e2\u2030\u00a57\u00e2\u20ac\u2026years had significantly higher odds of shortness of breath. [5] Use of flavouring ingredients was significantly associated with work-related nasal symptoms, work-related breathing trouble and work-related usual cough. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is indirectly related to respiration through its association with work-related breathing troubles and respiratory symptoms among participants exposed to flavoring ingredients. While the study highlights respiratory issues linked to occupational exposure, it does not specifically detail the effects of Butane-2,3-dione on respiratory function or health outcomes, leaving the relationship somewhat vague.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned in the context of exposure to flavoring ingredients associated with respiratory symptoms, but there is no direct evidence or detailed discussion of its specific impact on respiration.",
