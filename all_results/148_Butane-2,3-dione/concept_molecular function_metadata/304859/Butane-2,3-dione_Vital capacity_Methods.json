    "context": "[3] The questionnaire addressed respiratory symptoms and diagnoses, smoking history, work history and practices, and demographic information. [4] The respiratory questions were adapted from validated survey instruments. [1] We conducted and interpreted spirometry testing according to published guidelines using a dry rolling-seal spirometer. [2] We defined obstruction as FEV1 and ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) below their respective lower limits of normal (5th centiles) with a normal FVC. [3] We defined restrictive pattern as a normal FEV1/FVC ratio with FVC below the lower limit of normal. [4] We classified participants with both FEV1/FVC ratio and FVC below the lower limit of normal as having mixed obstructive and restrictive abnormalities. [5] We considered participants to have any spirometric abnormality if they met the definition of obstruction, restrictive pattern or mixed pattern. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly mentioned in relation to vital capacity. The focus is on spirometry testing and definitions of respiratory patterns, including obstructive and restrictive abnormalities based on FEV1 and FVC measurements. There is no discussion of how Butane-2,3-dione may affect vital capacity or respiratory function, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that Butane-2,3-dione and vital capacity are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion or evidence of their relationship. They appear coincidentally without any direct connection.",
