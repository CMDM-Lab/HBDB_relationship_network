    "context": "[3] Indeed, earlier reports of obliterative bronchiolitis in flavouring-exposed workers that emphasised fixed obstruction on spirometry and normal diffusing capacity , , have given way to a more nuanced picture that includes a range of spirometric and diffusing capacity results. [4] , In one recent case series of biopsy-proven obliterative bronchiolitis unrelated to flavourings, a minority (5%) had obstruction and 60% had diffusing capacity defects.  [1] There are several limitations to address.  [2] First, because our evaluation was cross-sectional, it was not possible to demonstrate patterns of lung function change over time.  [3] To estimate exposure, we used exposure surrogates rather than quantitative measurements, which may have allowed us to make more definitive conclusions about particular flavouring chemicals and cleaning products.  [4] It is possible that differences between participants and non-participants introduced bias, but the high participation rate (93%) suggests our findings are representative.  [5] As we relied on participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reports for exposure surrogates and some health outcomes, our results could be affected by reporting biases. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is indirectly related to respiratory physiology through its association with lung function changes observed in workers exposed to flavoring agents. The discussion focuses on the effects of exposure on spirometry and diffusing capacity, indicating that certain chemicals, potentially including Butane-2,3-dione, may contribute to respiratory issues like obliterative bronchiolitis. However, the specific role of Butane-2,3-dione in respiratory physiology is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Butane-2,3-dione and respiratory physiology, as they are mentioned in the context of lung function changes due to chemical exposure, but without a direct or detailed relationship established.",
