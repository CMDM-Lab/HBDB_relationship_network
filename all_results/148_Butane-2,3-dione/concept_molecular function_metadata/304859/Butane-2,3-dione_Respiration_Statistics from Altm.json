    "context": "[1] Conclusions Symptoms and lung function findings were consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis and associated with workplace exposures. [2] Further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Efforts to address adverse respiratory effects of flavouring manufacture that focus solely on diacetyl exposure reduction are unlikely to be successful. [2] Until the safety of other flavouring chemicals is established, exposure reduction (such as through enhanced ventilation and use of respiratory protection) and medical surveillance are prudent. [1] Occupational exposure to the butter flavouring chemical diacetyl has been associated with obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as bronchiolitis obliterans) in the microwave popcorn, diacetyl manufacture and coffee processing industries. [2] Laboratory animal models have confirmed the respiratory toxicity of diacetyl and its substitute, 2,3-pentanedione. [3] A decade of investigation led to the formal proposal in 2011 of recommended exposure limits for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in the USA. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is linked to respiratory health, particularly concerning its association with obliterative bronchiolitis due to occupational exposure in industries like popcorn and coffee processing. The respiratory toxicity of diacetyl has been confirmed in laboratory models, indicating its harmful effects on lung function and the necessity for exposure reduction measures to protect respiratory health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and respiration, as the context discusses the respiratory toxicity of diacetyl and its implications for lung health, supported by evidence from both occupational studies and laboratory models.",
        "score": 4
