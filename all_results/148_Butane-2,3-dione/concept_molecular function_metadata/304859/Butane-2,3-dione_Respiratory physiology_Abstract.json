    "context": "[2] Although carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most important components present in SHS, few studies to date have aimed at quantifying the reduction of CO exposure after smoking-ban laws. [1] We were able to describe significant environment and individual reductions in CO concentrations. [2] The effect of the smoke-ban law was detectable in all environments of visited venues and, most importantly, in both non-smoking and smoking employees. [1] Methods We offered a questionnaire and lung function testing to the current workforce of a flavouring manufacturing facility that had transitioned away from diacetyl and towards substitutes in recent years. [2] We examined symptoms, spirometric parameters and diffusing capacity measurements by exposure variables, including facility tenure and time spent daily in production areas. [3] We used linear and logistic regression to develop final models adjusted for age and smoking status. [1] Results A total of 367 (93%) current workers participated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is indirectly related to respiratory physiology through its mention in the study of lung function and exposure in a flavoring manufacturing facility. The study focuses on the effects of transitioning away from diacetyl towards substitutes, highlighting concerns about respiratory health among workers. While the relationship is relevant, it is not deeply explored in terms of specific physiological impacts or mechanisms related to Butane-2,3-dione.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is linked to respiratory physiology through its association with lung function testing in workers exposed to it. However, the context does not provide detailed insights into the specific physiological effects of Butane-2,3-dione.",
