    "context": "[7] Given that decline in lung function can occur rapidly and early in employment in flavouring-related obliterative bronchiolitis, , frequent medical surveillance of exposed workers that includes high-quality spirometry and close attention to declines (even within the normal range) is warranted. [8] Furthermore, in the absence of additional toxicological information, an emphasis on exposure reduction through enhanced ventilation and use of respiratory protection is prudent. [1] Among current flavouring manufacturing workers, some symptoms and diagnoses were more common than expected, while spirometric abnormalities were not in excess. [2] Symptoms, lung function abnormalities and average lung function values differed by exposure. [3] These differences could not be explained by age, smoking status or employment at another flavouring plant, suggesting that they reflect outcomes of occupational exposures at the facility. [4] These findings are most consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis in this workforce and indicate that further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Objectives: Four diacetyl workers were found to have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is implicated in respiratory physiology due to its association with occupational lung diseases, particularly obliterative bronchiolitis among workers exposed to flavoring agents. The study highlights the need for medical surveillance and exposure reduction to mitigate respiratory health risks linked to diacetyl exposure, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and respiratory function outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and respiratory physiology, as the context discusses the health impacts of diacetyl exposure on lung function and the necessity for monitoring respiratory health in affected workers, supported by evidence of specific respiratory conditions.",
