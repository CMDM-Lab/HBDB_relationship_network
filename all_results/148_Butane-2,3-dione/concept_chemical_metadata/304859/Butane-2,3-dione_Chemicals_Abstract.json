    "context": "[6] Mean diffusing capacity parameters were significantly lower in those with tenure \u00e2\u2030\u00a57\u00e2\u20ac\u2026years. [7] Differences in symptoms and lung function could not be explained by age, smoking status or employment at another flavouring plant. [1] Conclusions Symptoms and lung function findings were consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis and associated with workplace exposures. [2] Further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Efforts to address adverse respiratory effects of flavouring manufacture that focus solely on diacetyl exposure reduction are unlikely to be successful. [2] Until the safety of other flavouring chemicals is established, exposure reduction (such as through enhanced ventilation and use of respiratory protection) and medical surveillance are prudent. [1] Occupational exposure to the butter flavouring chemical diacetyl has been associated with obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as bronchiolitis obliterans) in the microwave popcorn, diacetyl manufacture and coffee processing industries.

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is identified as a specific flavoring chemical associated with adverse respiratory effects, particularly obliterative bronchiolitis, in occupational settings. The discussion emphasizes the need for exposure reduction to flavoring chemicals, indicating that Butane-2,3-dione is a representative example of the broader category of chemicals that pose health risks in the workplace. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the specific health implications of Butane-2,3-dione rather than a detailed exploration of its interactions with other chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is a specific example of a chemical linked to health risks, while the context discusses the broader category of flavoring chemicals. The relationship is significant but not deeply explored beyond the implications of Butane-2,3-dione.",
