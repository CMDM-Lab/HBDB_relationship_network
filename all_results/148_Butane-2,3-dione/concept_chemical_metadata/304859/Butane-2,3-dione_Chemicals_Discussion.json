    "context": "[5] Similarly, a longer-term sample that resulted in a concentration of 26\u00e2\u20ac\u2026ppb is concerning as the proposed time-weighted average exposure limit for 2,3-pentanedione is 9.3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026ppb. [6] Our measurements, although limited, highlight what appears to be an ongoing shift in the flavouring manufacturing industry away from diacetyl and towards chemically related substitutes that may have comparable toxicity. [7] , , Until the safety of diacetyl substitutes has been established, these flavouring chemicals should be considered to be respiratory toxins and handled using the same controls in place for diacetyl. [1] Little is known about the respiratory toxicity of the many flavouring chemicals other than diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione used at the facility. [2] It is certainly possible that we detected not only a spectrum of physiological findings of one flavouring-related disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, but also a spectrum of flavouring-related lung diseases. [3] In addition to obliterative bronchiolitis, our findings could indicate risk of emphysema (obstruction and low diffusing capacity) and/or interstitial lung disease (restriction and low diffusing capacity). [4] Despite predominantly fixed obstruction, the reported work-related pattern of some symptoms also raises the possibility of occupational or work-exacerbated asthma. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned as a flavoring chemical that is part of a broader discussion on respiratory toxicity associated with flavoring chemicals, including diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione. The text emphasizes the need for caution in handling these chemicals due to their potential respiratory hazards, indicating that Butane-2,3-dione is included in the category of chemicals that may pose similar risks. However, the specific relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and the broader category of chemicals is not deeply explored beyond its classification as a flavoring agent.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is identified as a flavoring chemical within a discussion about respiratory toxicity, indicating its significance in the context of chemical safety. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration.",
