    "context": "[1] Occupational exposure to the butter flavouring chemical diacetyl has been associated with obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as bronchiolitis obliterans) in the microwave popcorn, diacetyl manufacture and coffee processing industries. [2] Laboratory animal models have confirmed the respiratory toxicity of diacetyl and its substitute, 2,3-pentanedione. [3] A decade of investigation led to the formal proposal in 2011 of recommended exposure limits for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in the USA. [1] Far less is known about the respiratory toxicity of other diacetyl substitutes or the multitude of other flavouring chemicals currently in use. [2] Two cases of obliterative bronchiolitis in California flavouring manufacturing workers prompted industry-wide state surveillance that identified other probable cases and abnormal declines in the forced expiratory volume in 1\u00e2\u20ac\u2026s (FEV1) on longitudinal spirometry. [3] , An investigation at an Indiana flavouring manufacturing facility found an excess of spirometric restriction cross-sectionally and flavouring-related abnormal declines in FEV1 longitudinally. [4] The finding of spirometric restriction could be consistent with obliterative bronchiolitis from diacetyl or it could represent distinct pathological effects of other exposures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is discussed as a chemical associated with respiratory toxicity, particularly in occupational settings involving flavoring agents. The text highlights the health risks linked to diacetyl and its substitutes, indicating that it is part of a broader category of flavoring chemicals that may pose similar health hazards. However, the relationship is primarily focused on diacetyl rather than a detailed exploration of Butane-2,3-dione's interactions with other chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is specifically mentioned in relation to its health effects among a broader category of chemicals. While there is a connection to other flavoring chemicals, the focus remains on diacetyl's toxicity rather than a comprehensive analysis of its relationship with all chemicals.",
