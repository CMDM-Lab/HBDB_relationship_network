    "context": "[5] Similarly, a longer-term sample that resulted in a concentration of 26\u00e2\u20ac\u2026ppb is concerning as the proposed time-weighted average exposure limit for 2,3-pentanedione is 9.3\u00e2\u20ac\u2026ppb. [6] Our measurements, although limited, highlight what appears to be an ongoing shift in the flavouring manufacturing industry away from diacetyl and towards chemically related substitutes that may have comparable toxicity. [7] , , Until the safety of diacetyl substitutes has been established, these flavouring chemicals should be considered to be respiratory toxins and handled using the same controls in place for diacetyl. [1] Little is known about the respiratory toxicity of the many flavouring chemicals other than diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione used at the facility. [2] It is certainly possible that we detected not only a spectrum of physiological findings of one flavouring-related disease, obliterative bronchiolitis, but also a spectrum of flavouring-related lung diseases. [3] In addition to obliterative bronchiolitis, our findings could indicate risk of emphysema (obstruction and low diffusing capacity) and/or interstitial lung disease (restriction and low diffusing capacity). [4] Despite predominantly fixed obstruction, the reported work-related pattern of some symptoms also raises the possibility of occupational or work-exacerbated asthma. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and Pentanedione are both mentioned as flavoring chemicals that may pose respiratory toxicity risks similar to diacetyl. The discussion highlights a shift in the flavoring manufacturing industry towards these substitutes, indicating that they may have comparable toxicological profiles. However, the specific relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and Pentanedione is not elaborated upon beyond their shared classification as potentially harmful flavoring agents.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in the context of respiratory toxicity and their use as substitutes for diacetyl. However, their direct interaction or specific comparative toxicity is not detailed, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
