    "context": "[1] Conclusions Symptoms and lung function findings were consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis and associated with workplace exposures. [2] Further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Efforts to address adverse respiratory effects of flavouring manufacture that focus solely on diacetyl exposure reduction are unlikely to be successful. [2] Until the safety of other flavouring chemicals is established, exposure reduction (such as through enhanced ventilation and use of respiratory protection) and medical surveillance are prudent. [1] Occupational exposure to the butter flavouring chemical diacetyl has been associated with obliterative bronchiolitis (also known as bronchiolitis obliterans) in the microwave popcorn, diacetyl manufacture and coffee processing industries. [2] Laboratory animal models have confirmed the respiratory toxicity of diacetyl and its substitute, 2,3-pentanedione. [3] A decade of investigation led to the formal proposal in 2011 of recommended exposure limits for diacetyl and 2,3-pentanedione in the USA. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned as a flavoring chemical related to workplace exposures that may lead to respiratory issues, similar to diacetyl. The discussion emphasizes the need for safety evaluations of flavoring chemicals, indicating that Butane-2,3-dione is part of a broader category of chemicals that pose health risks in occupational settings. However, the specific relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and the general term 'chemicals' is not deeply explored beyond its classification as a flavoring agent.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione is identified as a flavoring chemical associated with health risks, linking it to the broader category of chemicals. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific implications of Butane-2,3-dione beyond its mention as a chemical of concern.",
