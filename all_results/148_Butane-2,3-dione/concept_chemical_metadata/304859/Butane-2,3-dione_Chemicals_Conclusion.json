    "context": "[1] Among current flavouring manufacturing workers, some symptoms and diagnoses were more common than expected, while spirometric abnormalities were not in excess. [2] Symptoms, lung function abnormalities and average lung function values differed by exposure. [3] These differences could not be explained by age, smoking status or employment at another flavouring plant, suggesting that they reflect outcomes of occupational exposures at the facility. [4] These findings are most consistent with undiagnosed or subclinical obliterative bronchiolitis in this workforce and indicate that further efforts to lower exposures to flavouring chemicals, including diacetyl substitutes, are warranted. [1] Objectives: Four diacetyl workers were found to have bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. [2] Exposures, respiratory symptoms, lung function and exposure\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse relationships were investigated. [1] Methods: 175 workers from a plant producing diacetyl between 1960 and 2003 were investigated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is identified as a specific chemical associated with occupational exposure among flavoring manufacturing workers. The study highlights health issues, particularly respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, linked to exposure to flavoring chemicals, including diacetyl. This indicates a direct relevance of Butane-2,3-dione as a chemical of concern in the workplace, emphasizing the need for reduced exposure to such chemicals to protect worker health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and chemicals in the context of occupational health. The study provides evidence of health risks associated with exposure to diacetyl, indicating its relevance as a harmful chemical in the flavoring industry.",
