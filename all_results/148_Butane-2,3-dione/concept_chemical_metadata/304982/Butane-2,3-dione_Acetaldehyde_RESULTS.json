    "context": "[1] Limited routine exposure monitoring was carried out by company representatives using cartridges containing silica gel coated with dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH cartridges), and each sample was analysed externally for both diacetyl and acetaldehyde using gas chromatography. [2] Twenty six area samples (mean sampling duration 120 min; range 82\u00e2\u20ac\u201c219 min) and four personal task-based samples (mean 65 min; range 33\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90 min) for the period 1995\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2003 could be traced (table 1). [3] All area samples had been taken in locations in the plant where operator activities were performed. [4] Control measures taken in 2001 to enclose the process led to a reduced exposure for both diacetyl (geometric mean (GM) change from 10.0 to 5.8 mg/m3) and acetaldehyde (GM change from 7.6 to 0.7 mg/m3). [1] During production, process operators were potentially exposed to diacetyl while quality checking, discharging to a buffer vessel, checking process parameters in the plant, charging batch columns, discharging into 50 kg and 2.5 l containers, and cleaning activities. [2] According to the company representatives, discharge of diacetyl into containers had the highest exposure potential, and for this reason, task based samples were available for this specific activity. [3] Although exposure to diacetyl was mainly relevant for process operators, workers with several other occupational titles were also potentially exposed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and acetaldehyde are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored for exposure in a production environment. The study highlights that control measures implemented in 2001 significantly reduced exposure levels for both compounds. However, the relationship between them is primarily based on their co-occurrence in the workplace and the shared context of exposure monitoring rather than any direct chemical interaction or metabolic relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both Butane-2,3-dione and acetaldehyde are mentioned in the context of exposure monitoring, but their relationship is not deeply explored beyond their presence in the same occupational setting.",
        "score": 2
