    "context": "[1] The questionnaire had several detailed items on work history and work-related symptoms, both in the diacetyl plant (job title, duration and number of days/week) and other plants at the production site (type of plant, type of exposure, duration and number of days/week). [2] In addition, workers were asked if they had experienced exposure incidents, for example during maintenance and/or process disturbances. [1] Experienced technicians obtained spirometric lung function variables in all participants according to European Respiratory Society standards using a pneumotachograph with specific software (Pneumotachograph with 4.66 software; Jaeger, Wurzburg, Germany). [2] Age- and standing height-adjusted spirometric reference values of the European Community for Steel and Coal were used. [1] To compare symptom prevalence between the two groups, we used data from male subjects aged between 30 and 70 (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u0160159 diacetyl production workers and n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601125 subjects from the EHRCS population). [2] For analysis of lung function data, we only used data from Caucasian males aged 30\u00e2\u20ac\u201c70 (n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u0160149 diacetyl production workers and n\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601084 subjects from the EHRCS population) as there were too few non-Caucasian workers in the diacetyl population. [1] The working schedule varied considerably among workers as some worked in the diacetyl plant for five successive days, whereas others were scheduled to work in the diacetyl plant for only 1 day per week.

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to workers in a diacetyl production plant, while coal is referenced in the context of using spirometric reference values from the European Community for Steel and Coal. However, there is no direct discussion of a relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and coal, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any indication of interaction or relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and coal, as they are mentioned in different contexts without any direct or indirect connection or relevance to each other.",
