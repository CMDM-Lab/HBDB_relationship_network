    "context": "[1] Methods: 175 workers from a plant producing diacetyl between 1960 and 2003 were investigated. [2] Exposure data were used to model diacetyl exposure. [3] Lung function and questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms were compared to a general population sample and respiratory symptoms to an internal reference group. [1] Results: Workers were potentially exposed to acetoin, diacetyl, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. [2] Historic diacetyl exposure ranged from 1.8 to 351 mg/m3, and from 3 to 396 mg/m3 for specific tasks. [3] Diacetyl workers reported significantly more respiratory symptoms compared to the general population sample (continuous trouble with breathing (prevalence ratio (PR)\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.6; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.1), daily cough (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01601.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1), asthma attack (ever) (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.0; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4), doctor diagnosed asthma (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) and asthma attack in the last year (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01604.7; 95% CI 1.9 to 11.4)) and to a minimally exposed internal reference group (ever trouble with breathing (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01602.8; 95% CI 1.1 to 7.0) and work-related shortness of breath in the last year (PR\u00e2\u20ac\u0160=\u00e2\u20ac\u01607.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 52.9)).

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as chemicals to which workers were potentially exposed in a plant producing diacetyl. However, the context does not provide specific details about their interactions or shared effects on health. Both compounds are part of the exposure profile, but their relationship is not elaborated upon beyond their presence in the same occupational setting.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Butane-2,3-dione and acetaldehyde are listed together in the context of worker exposure, indicating they belong to the same category of chemicals, but without any direct interaction or significant relationship discussed.",
