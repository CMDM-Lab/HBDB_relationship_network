    "context": "[3] Mean age was 51 years and ranged from 25 to 78 years. [4] There were 27% current smokers and 41% former smokers, and 33% had never smoked. [5] Overall, 102 participants had ever worked at the diacetyl plant as a process operator for an average of 10.4 years with a range of 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c29 years. [1] Limited routine exposure monitoring was carried out by company representatives using cartridges containing silica gel coated with dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH cartridges), and each sample was analysed externally for both diacetyl and acetaldehyde using gas chromatography. [2] Twenty six area samples (mean sampling duration 120 min; range 82\u00e2\u20ac\u201c219 min) and four personal task-based samples (mean 65 min; range 33\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90 min) for the period 1995\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2003 could be traced (table 1). [3] All area samples had been taken in locations in the plant where operator activities were performed. [4] Control measures taken in 2001 to enclose the process led to a reduced exposure for both diacetyl (geometric mean (GM) change from 10.0 to 5.8 mg/m3) and acetaldehyde (GM change from 7.6 to 0.7 mg/m3).

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is analyzed using dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridges for exposure monitoring in a diacetyl plant. DNPH is employed to capture and quantify carbonyl compounds like diacetyl and acetaldehyde through gas chromatography. This indicates a direct analytical relationship where DNPH serves as a reagent for detecting Butane-2,3-dione in occupational exposure assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butane-2,3-dione and dinitrophenylhydrazine, as DNPH is specifically used to monitor diacetyl levels in the workplace, demonstrating a clear functional relationship supported by the context of exposure analysis.",
