    "context": "The following GC running program was applied: 40\u00b0C for 1min, heating 4\u00b0C/min to 175\u00b0C, heating 20\u00b0C/min to 240\u00b0C which was held for 7min. VOCs were identified and quantified by HP 5973 mass selective detector used in scanning (m/z 30\u2013350) mode. The following reference compounds were used in identification: diacetyl (>97%, Aldrich), 3-methylbutanaldehyd (>97%, Aldrich), 2-pentanone (>98%, Fluka), 3-methyl-1-butanol (>99%, Fluka), acetoin (>99.9%, Supelco), 1-octen-3-ol (>98%, Aldrich), hexanal (>98%, Aldrich), 1-hexanol (>99%, Fluka), 2-methyl-1-butanol (>99%, Aldrich), 1-pentanol (>99%, Aldrich). For quantification purposes, 4-methyl-1-pentanol (>97%, Aldrich) was added to each 10-g powdered meat sample as internal standard. Peak areas of compounds detected in meat were normalized against the peak area of the internal standard to calculate the relative concentrations expressed as arbitrary units (AU)/g.HPLC analysis of acetic acid Acetic acid was analyzed by HPLC from the bulk samples of pork in the beginning of the experiment and at the time of sensory spoilage or after 19days of storage for sterilized samples as described before (Dalgaard and J\u00f8rgensen, 2000). External standard was used for identification and quantification.Partial least squares regression VOC data were used to predict the percentage of sensory spoiled samples (% class 3) by using partial least squares regression (PLSR) as previously described by J\u00f8rgensen et al. (2001). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and n-hexanal are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified and quantified during the gas chromatography (GC) analysis of meat samples. However, the context does not provide any specific information about their interactions, functional relationships, or comparative significance in the study, indicating they are merely part of a broader analysis of VOCs in food spoilage.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are mentioned in the same context of VOC analysis but without any direct interaction or detailed relationship discussed between them.",
