    "context": "To predict class 3 sensory assessments using VOC data, we did a PLSR analysis including relative concentrations of all the 48 VOCs detected in the pork samples. Thirty-three bulk and retail samples of pork were included. The lowest root mean squared error of prediction (0.205) was obtained using two latent variables. The VOCs with the highest loadings on the two latent variables were diacetyl, 3-methylbutanal, 2-methyl-1-butanol, acetoin, hexanal and 1-hexanol. The cross-validated predictions obtained by the model incorporating the two latent variables explained only 62% of the Y-variance, indicating that accurate prediction of sensory spoilage with the VOC data was not achieved. Relationships between levels of VOC (log AU/g) and levels of bacteria (log CFU/g) were also determined by linear correlation of the dataset containing bulk, retail and sterilized samples of pork (n =43). Of the VOCs detected, the levels of diacetyl showed the strongest correlation with levels of aerobic bacteria (R 2 0.65), lactic acid bacteria (R 2 0.65) and B. thermosphacta (R 2 0.65). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and n-hexanal are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in pork samples analyzed for sensory spoilage. While both compounds are included in the analysis of VOCs, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between them. Instead, they are part of a broader study examining the correlation of various VOCs with bacterial levels in pork, with diacetyl showing a stronger correlation with aerobic bacteria than n-hexanal.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Butane-2,3-dione and n-hexanal are mentioned as VOCs in the same study, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
