    "context": "The cross-validated predictions obtained by the model incorporating the two latent variables explained only 62% of the Y-variance, indicating that accurate prediction of sensory spoilage with the VOC data was not achieved. Relationships between levels of VOC (log AU/g) and levels of bacteria (log CFU/g) were also determined by linear correlation of the dataset containing bulk, retail and sterilized samples of pork (n =43). Of the VOCs detected, the levels of diacetyl showed the strongest correlation with levels of aerobic bacteria (R 2 0.65), lactic acid bacteria (R 2 0.65) and B. thermosphacta (R 2 0.65). The corresponding R 2 values for acetoin were 0.45 to 0.54 and for 3-methyl-1-butanol 0.50 to 0.65. By selecting only MAP loin (n =19) or only MAP collar (n =18) samples from the combined dataset, stronger correlations were obtained: R 2 values for correlations of diacetyl and the levels of the three groups of bacteria (aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, B. thermosphacta) ranged from 0.72 to 0.87 for loin and 0.68 to 0.74 for collar samples. Acetic acid was detected in Loin W and Collar W but not in Loin P or Collar P at the time of sensory spoilage. The concentrations\u00b1standard deviations were 228\u00b172 and 678\u00b1202mg/kg meat (wet weight) for Loin W and Collar W, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and isopentyl alcohol are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in pork samples, with diacetyl showing a strong correlation with levels of various bacteria. However, the relationship between these two specific compounds is not directly discussed, and their individual roles in sensory spoilage are highlighted without a clear interaction between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are mentioned in the context of VOCs related to spoilage in pork, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
