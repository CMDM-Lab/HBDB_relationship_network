    "context": "High concentrations of P. phosphoreum is likely to produce biogenic amines in pork meat and it seems interesting to evaluate if profiles of biogenic amine can be used as a multiple compound quality index for this product as determined for cold-smoked salmon (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2000a, 2000b). Concentrations of 1-octen-3-ol, 1-pentanol, hexanal and 2-pentanone increased in both sterilized and non-sterilized samples of pork during storage. These VOCs are associated with oxidation of lipids that is facilitated by the high oxygen concentration in the storage atmosphere used in this study. The levels of 1-octen-3-ol, 1-pentanol, hexanal and 2-pentanone measured in non-sterilized samples of pork at the time of spoilage did not cause spoilage of sterilized pork indicating that chemical lipid oxidation most likely did not cause spoilage of the non-sterilized samples. It is possible, however, that lipid oxidation products contributed to the overall odor of spoiled pork, especially in Collar W that had higher concentrations of hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol and 1-pentanol than any of the other pork samples at the time of spoilage. Interestingly, in a study by Argyri et al. (2015) hexanal was associated with fresh rather than spoiled meat which was not the case in our study. Although all samples contained hexanal, the related 1-hexanol was exclusively observed in pork collar which had a higher pH than pork loin (Table 2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and 2-pentanone are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with the storage and spoilage of pork meat. While 2-pentanone is specifically noted to increase during storage, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly discussed in relation to spoilage or oxidation processes. Their relationship is implied through their shared context as VOCs in food quality assessment, but no direct interaction or comparative analysis is provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Butane-2,3-dione and 2-pentanone, as both are VOCs relevant to the study of pork spoilage. However, their specific relationship is not detailed, limiting the strength of their connection.",
