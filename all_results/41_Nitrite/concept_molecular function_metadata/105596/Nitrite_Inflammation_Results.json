    "context": "When patients were analyzed with regard to the extent of lung injury (AECC definition), regression lines were shifted up and somewhat steeper in the presence of ARDS, or shifted down and less steep in the absence of lung injury (ARDS, y = 1.12x \u2212 1.21, r = 0.90, p < 0.0001; ALI, y = 0.90x \u2212 1.24, r = 0.74, p < 0.004; no lung injury, y = 0.78x \u2212 1.27, r = 0.96, p < 0.0008). EBC NO2 \u2212 and Inflammation Correlation coefficients and p values for the relations between EBC NO2 \u2212 and pulmonary or systemic markers of inflammation are depicted in Table 3 . No significant correlation between the chosen markers of inflammation and EBC NO2 \u2212 were observed. A correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 with pulmonary or systemic inflammation is therefore not supported by our results. EBC NO2 \u2212 Normalized to Vt If EBC NO2 \u2212 truly reflects pulmonary distension, and if distension is greater in more severe lung injury due to derecruitment, the relation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and Vt (ie, EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt [milliliters per kilogram of BW] ratio) should be directly correlated to the extent of lung injury. In support of this assumption, Figure 3 indeed demonstrates significant correlations of the continuous-parameter LISS with EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt ratio (Fig 3, right; r = 0.84, p < 0.0001) as well as of the Pao 2/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2) ratio (the continuous parameter of the AECC classification) with EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt (Fig 3, left; r = 0.66, p < 0.0001). In contrast, no correlation of Vt alone with either LISS or Pao 2/Fio 2 was observed (LISS, r = 0.05, p = 0.77; Pao 2/Fio 2, r = 0.17, p = 0.32). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 \u2212) is analyzed in relation to markers of inflammation in patients with varying degrees of lung injury. The study found no significant correlation between EBC NO2 \u2212 and pulmonary or systemic markers of inflammation, suggesting that nitrite levels do not reflect inflammatory processes in the studied conditions. Although there are correlations with lung injury parameters, the lack of a direct relationship with inflammation indicates a complex interaction that does not support a straightforward link between nitrite and inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as nitrite is mentioned in the context of inflammation but lacks significant correlation with inflammatory markers. The relationship is not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction.",
