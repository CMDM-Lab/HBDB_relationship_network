    "context": "EBC NO2 \u2212 and Inflammation Correlation coefficients and p values for the relations between EBC NO2 \u2212 and pulmonary or systemic markers of inflammation are depicted in Table 3 . No significant correlation between the chosen markers of inflammation and EBC NO2 \u2212 were observed. A correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 with pulmonary or systemic inflammation is therefore not supported by our results. EBC NO2 \u2212 Normalized to Vt If EBC NO2 \u2212 truly reflects pulmonary distension, and if distension is greater in more severe lung injury due to derecruitment, the relation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and Vt (ie, EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt [milliliters per kilogram of BW] ratio) should be directly correlated to the extent of lung injury. In support of this assumption, Figure 3 indeed demonstrates significant correlations of the continuous-parameter LISS with EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt ratio (Fig 3, right; r = 0.84, p < 0.0001) as well as of the Pao 2/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2) ratio (the continuous parameter of the AECC classification) with EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt (Fig 3, left; r = 0.66, p < 0.0001). In contrast, no correlation of Vt alone with either LISS or Pao 2/Fio 2 was observed (LISS, r = 0.05, p = 0.77; Pao 2/Fio 2, r = 0.17, p = 0.32). Correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and BAL NO2 \u2212 In 10 patients in whom a BAL was indicated for microbiologic diagnosis, BAL NO2 \u2212 was determined and compared to EBC NO2 \u2212. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 \u2212) is investigated for its potential correlation with pulmonary distension and lung injury. The study suggests that while EBC NO2 \u2212 may reflect aspects of lung injury, no significant correlation was found between EBC NO2 \u2212 and markers of inflammation. The relationship between nitrite and pathological dilatation is implied through the exploration of lung injury severity, but direct evidence linking nitrite levels to pathological dilatation is not established.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is examined in relation to lung injury and distension, indicating some connection to pathological dilatation. However, the lack of significant correlation with inflammation markers limits the strength of this relationship.",
