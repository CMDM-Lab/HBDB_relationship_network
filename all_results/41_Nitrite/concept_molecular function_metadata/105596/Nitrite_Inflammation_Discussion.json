    "context": "We have previously reported that the amount of breath condensate collected depends almost exclusively on the expired volume. 39 We therefore suggest a mechanism linking alveolar distension to the production of nitric oxide and subsequently to the generation of nitrite in the ELF. This is likely a mechanism located in the periphery of the lung, since EBC is thought to be generated in the lower respiratory tract and the alveoli. 40 The results of our investigation suggest a close relation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and pulmonary distension but no correlation with parameters of pulmonary or systemic inflammation. EBC NO2 \u2212 normalized to Vt can indicate inappropriate distension (ie, NO2 \u2212 release) at a given Vt, and exhibited close correlation with clinical scores of lung injury in this study. This inappropriate distension may be the consequence of increasing derecruitment with increasing lung injury. Further evaluation of this marker may reveal its clinical usefulness as a practical marker to monitor patients receiving mechanical ventilation for increased mechanical stress. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is linked to inflammation through its production as a byproduct of nitric oxide in the lungs, particularly in relation to alveolar distension. However, the study indicates that there is no direct correlation between nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and systemic or pulmonary inflammation parameters. Instead, nitrite levels may serve as a marker for lung injury rather than inflammation itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is associated with lung injury and its production is linked to inflammation mechanisms, but the lack of correlation with inflammation parameters limits the strength of their relationship.",
