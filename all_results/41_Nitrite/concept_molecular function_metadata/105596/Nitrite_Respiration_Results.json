Results EBC NO2 \u2212 and Clinical Scores EBC NO2 \u2212 was significantly different in the three patient groups: EBC NO2 \u2212 was increased in patients with ARDS compared to patients with ALI criteria or patients without signs of lung injury according to both AECC (ARDS, 6.28 \u00b1 1.94 \u03bcmol/L; ALI, 4.56 \u00b1 1.32 \u03bcmol/L; no lung injury, 3.58 \u00b1 1.52 \u03bcmol/L) as well as LISS criteria (ARDS, 6.26 \u00b1 1.71 \u03bcmol/L; ALI, 4.61 \u00b1 1.70 \u03bcmol/L; no lung injury, 3.23 \u00b1 2.07 \u03bcmol/L) [Fig 1 ]. EBC NO2 \u2212 and Ventilatory Parameters Table 2 summarizes the correlations between EBC NO2 \u2212 and ventilatory parameters. EBC NO2 \u2212 was closely correlated both to Vt and expiratory minute volume EMV) [in each case normalized to ideal BW] but not to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), or breathing frequency (BF). There was a weak correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and mean inspiratory airway pressure (Pmean; correlation coefficient < 0.5). The linear type of relationship of EBC NO2 \u2212 to Vt (y = 1.06x \u2212 1.80, r = 0.79, n = 35, p < 0.0001) is depicted in Figure 2 . The strong relationship of the two parameters seems to confirm our hypothesis that EBC NO2 \u2212 is related to pulmonary distension. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 \u2212) is analyzed in relation to respiratory parameters in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). The study finds a significant correlation between EBC NO2 \u2212 levels and ventilatory parameters such as tidal volume (Vt) and expiratory minute volume (EMV), suggesting that nitrite levels may reflect pulmonary function and respiratory status. This indicates a direct relationship between nitrite and respiration, particularly in the context of lung injury.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and respiration, supported by statistical correlations and evidence from the study. The relationship is particularly relevant in the context of lung injury, where nitrite levels may serve as indicators of respiratory function.",
