    "context": "No significant correlation between the chosen markers of inflammation and EBC NO2 \u2212 were observed. A correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 with pulmonary or systemic inflammation is therefore not supported by our results. EBC NO2 \u2212 Normalized to Vt If EBC NO2 \u2212 truly reflects pulmonary distension, and if distension is greater in more severe lung injury due to derecruitment, the relation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and Vt (ie, EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt [milliliters per kilogram of BW] ratio) should be directly correlated to the extent of lung injury. In support of this assumption, Figure 3 indeed demonstrates significant correlations of the continuous-parameter LISS with EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt ratio (Fig 3, right; r = 0.84, p < 0.0001) as well as of the Pao 2/fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio 2) ratio (the continuous parameter of the AECC classification) with EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt (Fig 3, left; r = 0.66, p < 0.0001). In contrast, no correlation of Vt alone with either LISS or Pao 2/Fio 2 was observed (LISS, r = 0.05, p = 0.77; Pao 2/Fio 2, r = 0.17, p = 0.32). Correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and BAL NO2 \u2212 In 10 patients in whom a BAL was indicated for microbiologic diagnosis, BAL NO2 \u2212 was determined and compared to EBC NO2 \u2212. A significant correlation between both values was found (r = 0.79, p = 0.012). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2\u2212) is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential marker for pulmonary function and inflammation. The study explores the correlation between EBC NO2\u2212 and various parameters related to lung injury, including tidal volume (Vt). While significant correlations were found between EBC NO2\u2212 normalized to Vt and lung injury severity, the direct relationship between nitrite and inspiration function is not explicitly established, indicating a more complex interaction rather than a straightforward correlation.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is involved in assessing lung function and injury, but the relationship with inspiration function is not directly detailed, focusing instead on correlations with other parameters.",
