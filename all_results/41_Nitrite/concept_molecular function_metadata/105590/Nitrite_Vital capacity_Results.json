    "context": "EBC nitrite and pulmonary function tests Lung function characteristics of the different patient groups are shown in Table 1 (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, RV, TLC, and ITGV). Table 2 summarizes the correlations between EBC nitrite concentration and pulmonary function tests for COPD stage 1\u20134 and all COPD patients. EBC nitrite was closely correlated with residual volume (RV [L]), total lung capacity (TLC [L]), intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV [L]), and the RV/TLC ratio. EBC nitrite concentration was not correlated to forced vital capacity (FVC [L]) or the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver (FEV1 [L]) in the COPD patient group. A subgroup analysis of HS and VOL individuals revealed no correlation with respect to all of the pulmonary function tests investigated in this study. Patients with COPD stages 2, 3, and 4 exhibited a significant logarithmic correlation of EBC nitrite with RV, TLC, and ITGV (Table 2). Patients of COPD stage 4 exclusively exhibited a weak correlation with FVC in addition to the indicators of pulmonary hyperinflation (Table 2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are analyzed in relation to pulmonary function tests in COPD patients. While EBC nitrite shows significant correlations with residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC), and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV), it does not correlate with forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). This indicates that nitrite may be more relevant to certain aspects of lung function, particularly those associated with hyperinflation, rather than overall vital capacity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is correlated with specific pulmonary function metrics in COPD patients, but not with vital capacity measures like FVC and FEV1, indicating a nuanced relationship.",
