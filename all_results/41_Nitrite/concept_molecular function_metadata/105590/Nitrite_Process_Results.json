    "context": "IL-12p70: r=0.03, p=0.74; TNF-\u03b1: r=0.01, p=0.89). This was also true when EBC nitrite was correlated to EBC cytokines normalized to protein concentration in EBC (data not shown). Considering, that EBC cytokines likely represent pulmonary or airway inflammation, EBC nitrite did not appear to be an indicator of that same process. Correlation of EBC cytokines with pulmonary function tests No significant correlation was observed between any of the pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, RV, TLC, ITGV) and the levels of cytokines in EBC in the entire patient group, the same was true for COPD or healthy subgroups (data not shown). Discussion Our study was aimed at investigating the relationship of EBC nitrite and pulmonary hyperinflation. For that purpose, EBC nitrite was analyzed in healthy individuals, smokers without any sign of lung disease, and stable COPD in GOLD-stages 0\u20134 and was correlated with pulmonary function tests and with inflammatory cytokines in breath condensate.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to investigate its potential role as an indicator of pulmonary inflammation or hyperinflation processes. However, the study found no significant correlation between EBC nitrite levels and pulmonary function tests or inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that nitrite may not effectively represent the underlying inflammatory processes in the lungs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between nitrite and the process of pulmonary inflammation, as nitrite is examined in relation to inflammatory cytokines and pulmonary function. However, the lack of significant correlation indicates that their relationship is not well-defined or supported by strong evidence.",
