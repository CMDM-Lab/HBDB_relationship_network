    "context": "Correlation of EBC cytokines with pulmonary function tests No significant correlation was observed between any of the pulmonary function tests (FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, RV, TLC, ITGV) and the levels of cytokines in EBC in the entire patient group, the same was true for COPD or healthy subgroups (data not shown). Discussion Our study was aimed at investigating the relationship of EBC nitrite and pulmonary hyperinflation. For that purpose, EBC nitrite was analyzed in healthy individuals, smokers without any sign of lung disease, and stable COPD in GOLD-stages 0\u20134 and was correlated with pulmonary function tests and with inflammatory cytokines in breath condensate. We chose to measure nitrite and cytokine profiles in exhaled breath condensate because this material is collected non-invasively and in addition was thought to correlate best if the process of generation of cytokines and EBC nitrite were identical. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation due to airway inflammation, constriction and collapse in the presence of emphysema. The extent of limitation is usually monitored by pulmonary function tests such as FEV1, FVC, RV, or TLC. However, these parameters require patient cooperation and exhibit considerable variability. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to investigate its relationship with pulmonary function tests and inflammatory cytokines. The study aims to understand the process of nitrite generation in EBC and its potential correlation with airway inflammation in COPD. The choice of measuring nitrite alongside cytokines suggests a shared process in their generation, although no significant correlations were found with pulmonary function tests.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is part of the process of analyzing EBC for understanding pulmonary function and inflammation. The study indicates a potential link between nitrite and the processes involved in airway inflammation, but lacks strong evidence of direct correlation.",
