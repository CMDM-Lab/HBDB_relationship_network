    "context": "This limit is for the counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria. In our case, this limit was reached at around days 25 to 35, this result was similar to that from TVB-N content. Different countries have set their maximum limits for the RN content in salted meat. Under the Chinese standard (GB 2760, 2011), in commercially sterile and vacuum packaged Yao-meat, the maximum nitrite permitted is 30mg/kg. In the study, the range of RN content in Yao-meat was 14\u201320mg/kg during the 35days. This result was below to the limit set. In the first fifth days, the nitrite concentrations may decrease dramatically in Yao-meat. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its permissible levels in commercially sterile and vacuum-packaged Yao-meat. The study indicates that the nitrite concentration in the meat remained below the maximum limit set by Chinese standards, which is crucial for ensuring sterility and safety in food products. While nitrite is a preservative that can inhibit bacterial growth, the relationship to sterility is implied through regulatory limits rather than a direct discussion of their interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is linked to the concept of sterility through its regulatory limits in food safety. However, the context does not provide detailed evidence of how nitrite directly affects sterility beyond its permissible levels.",
        "score": 3
