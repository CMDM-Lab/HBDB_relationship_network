    "context": "The consecutive disruption of intracellular redox balance and inflammation both contribute to skeletal muscle mobilization. Hypoxia disrupts the efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inducing leakage of electrons to molecular oxygen and thereby generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often upregulated during expeditions at high altitude, and mechanisms linked to skeletal muscle wasting include activation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB catabolic pathways and inhibition of the anabolic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [27\u201329]. Nitric oxide (NO) metabolism is also influenced by oxygen availability as demonstrated by raised levels of nitrite and nitrate (markers of NO production) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a biomarker of NO activity) during acclimatization to high altitude. Therefore, physiological data and plasma samples from the 2007 Caudwell Xtreme Everest (CXE) expedition could provide valuable mechanistic insights into the relationship between hypoxia and FFM loss whereby the extended duration at high altitude serves as a pathogenic model of sarcopenia. We first assess body composition changes (FM and FFM) and fluid shifts [total body water (TBW), intracellular (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW)] that occurred during the expedition. We then evaluate the association between changes in FM and FFM with a comprehensive panel of biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, NO bioavailability, appetite control and intermediary metabolism to identify significant predictors of changes in FM and FFM during prolonged exposure to hypoxia.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is presented as a marker of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, particularly in relation to hypoxia and its effects on skeletal muscle. The study indicates that during high-altitude acclimatization, levels of nitrite and nitrate increase, reflecting enhanced NO production. This relationship is crucial for understanding how NO metabolism is influenced by oxygen availability and its implications for muscle health and metabolism under stress conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and nitric oxide metabolism, as the context discusses how nitrite levels serve as indicators of NO production during hypoxia, highlighting their relevance in physiological responses and potential implications for muscle health.",
