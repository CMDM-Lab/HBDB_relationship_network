    "context": "Secondly, plasma osmolality during the expedition did not change, which rules out the potential interference of changes in hydration status on BIA measurements (Table S2 of the Online Supplementary Material). Skinfold thickness was also measured during the expedition to assess body composition changes, but the results obtained using this method were unreliable and have therefore not been included in this report. Finally, the generalizability of these results to the general population is limited and therefore results should be interpreted with caution. However, the primary aim of the study was to provide clues as to the effects of prolonged hypoxia on loss of FFM and identify potential mechanisms involved in the development of sarcopenia.Implications for future research Changes in GLP-1 and nitrite concentrations are significantly correlated (Fig. S3 of the Online Supplementary Material), and both are significant predictors of FFM loss. These changes are likely to represent integrated compensatory responses to increase blood flow, delivery of nutrients and overall tissue metabolic capacity. The effects of these pathways on skeletal muscle structure and performance could be tested in future animal and human studies with exposure to normoxia and hypoxia and supplementation with, for example, incretins (or DPP-IV inhibitors) and dietary nitrate. Specifically we offer candidate mechanisms that can be further evaluated in patient groups where sarcopenia is common including older patients and critically ill patients, or in those susceptible to hypoxia as a result of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite and Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) are discussed as significantly correlated changes that predict loss of fat-free mass (FFM) during prolonged hypoxia. Both are suggested to represent compensatory responses aimed at enhancing blood flow and nutrient delivery, indicating a potential integrated role in metabolic adaptations related to muscle health and sarcopenia. Future research is encouraged to explore these mechanisms further, particularly in populations at risk for muscle loss.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and GLP-1, supported by evidence of their correlation and predictive value regarding FFM loss. Their roles in metabolic responses during hypoxia suggest a meaningful interaction, although further exploration is needed to fully elucidate their relationship.",
