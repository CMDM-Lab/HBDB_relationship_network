    "context": "This limit is for the counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria. In our case, this limit was reached at around days 25 to 35, this result was similar to that from TVB-N content. Different countries have set their maximum limits for the RN content in salted meat. Under the Chinese standard (GB 2760, 2011), in commercially sterile and vacuum packaged Yao-meat, the maximum nitrite permitted is 30mg/kg. In the study, the range of RN content in Yao-meat was 14\u201320mg/kg during the 35days. This result was below to the limit set. In the first fifth days, the nitrite concentrations may decrease dramatically in Yao-meat. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its permissible limits in salted meat, specifically Yao-meat. The text mentions that the maximum allowed nitrite concentration is 30 mg/kg according to Chinese standards, and the observed nitrite levels in the meat ranged from 14 to 20 mg/kg over a 35-day period. The relationship is focused on regulatory limits and the observed concentrations of nitrite in the product, indicating a concern for food safety and quality.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is mentioned in the context of its regulatory limits and actual concentrations in Yao-meat. While there is a clear connection regarding safety standards, the discussion does not delve into the biochemical implications or interactions of nitrite beyond its concentration levels.",
        "score": 3
