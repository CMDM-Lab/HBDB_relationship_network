    "context": "In the first fifth days, the nitrite concentrations may decrease dramatically in Yao-meat. At the early stage during refrigerated storage, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were the predominant spoilage bacteria in Yao-meat (Xiang, Ying, Ying, Min, & Lili, 2013). Some previous studies reported that the number and strains of LAB may affect the nitrite concentration. Under natural anaerobic conditions, nitrate may be converted to nitrite and further to nitrogen gas by some bacteria. LAB significantly reduced the nitrite concentration of salted meat (Dodds & Collins-Thompson, 1984; Liu, Han, & Zhou, 2011; Mares, Neyts, & Debevere, 1994; Wolf, Arendt, Pf\u00e4hler, & Hammes, 1990). After fifteen days, the nitrite concentrations may increase dramatically, as a greater proportion of the nitrate is converted to nitrite as a result of bacterial contamination and endogenous nitrate reductase action (Rinc\u00f3n, Mart\u0131\u0301nez, & Delgado, 2003). Under refrigerated storage, however, nitrite accumulation tends to be inhibited but may still occur, so continuous monitoring of residual nitrite content changes in Yao-meat is important to ensure that the dietary intake of nitrite is kept to below the limit set by Chinese standard.Colorimetric sensor array measurements Common pH indicator dyes change color in response to changes in the proton (Br\u00f8nsted) acidity or basicity of their environment (Suslick & Neal A. Rakow, 2004). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrogen gas are related through the biochemical processes involving lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the spoilage of Yao-meat. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is converted to nitrite and subsequently to nitrogen gas by certain bacteria. This indicates a metabolic pathway where nitrite serves as an intermediate in the reduction process to nitrogen gas, highlighting their interconnected roles in food spoilage and preservation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and nitrogen gas, as the context discusses their transformation through bacterial action, supported by references to studies on LAB's impact on nitrite levels. This relationship is crucial in understanding spoilage mechanisms in refrigerated meat.",
