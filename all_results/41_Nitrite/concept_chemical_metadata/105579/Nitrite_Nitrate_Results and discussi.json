    "context": "Although the VOCs changes of Yao-meat are a slow process so that it is difficultly differentiated by human nose, they can indirectly reflect the freshness of pork meat. During storage, the concentration of nitrite may vary in a wide range. At the early storage period, LAB significantly reduced the nitrite concentrations. In the later storage stage, nitrite concentrations can increase in salted Yao-meat as a greater proportion of the nitrate is converted to nitrite as a result of bacterial contamination and endogenous nitrate reductase action. The content change of TVB-N and RN are intimately associated with the bacterial load. So, colorimetric responses did in fact correlate well with those of TVB-N content, TVC and RN content, a better correlation was demonstrated between sensor array measurements and TVC of Yao-meat. In order to highlight the superiority of GA-PLS algorithm, it was compared with the classical partial least squares (PLS) in this work. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrate are related through their roles in the storage and preservation of Yao-meat. Initially, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) reduce nitrite concentrations, but as storage progresses, nitrite levels can rise due to the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, facilitated by bacterial contamination and the action of nitrate reductase. This indicates a dynamic relationship where nitrate serves as a precursor to nitrite during meat storage, influenced by microbial activity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and nitrate, as the context discusses their conversion process and the impact of bacterial action on their concentrations in Yao-meat. This relationship is supported by the context's focus on meat preservation and microbial interactions.",
        "score": 4
