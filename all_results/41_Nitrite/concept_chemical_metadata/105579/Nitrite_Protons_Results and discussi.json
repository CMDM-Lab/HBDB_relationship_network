    "context": "Under natural anaerobic conditions, nitrate may be converted to nitrite and further to nitrogen gas by some bacteria. LAB significantly reduced the nitrite concentration of salted meat (Dodds & Collins-Thompson, 1984; Liu, Han, & Zhou, 2011; Mares, Neyts, & Debevere, 1994; Wolf, Arendt, Pf\u00e4hler, & Hammes, 1990). After fifteen days, the nitrite concentrations may increase dramatically, as a greater proportion of the nitrate is converted to nitrite as a result of bacterial contamination and endogenous nitrate reductase action (Rinc\u00f3n, Mart\u0131\u0301nez, & Delgado, 2003). Under refrigerated storage, however, nitrite accumulation tends to be inhibited but may still occur, so continuous monitoring of residual nitrite content changes in Yao-meat is important to ensure that the dietary intake of nitrite is kept to below the limit set by Chinese standard.Colorimetric sensor array measurements Common pH indicator dyes change color in response to changes in the proton (Br\u00f8nsted) acidity or basicity of their environment (Suslick & Neal A. Rakow, 2004). Porphyrins and their metal complexes were used for recognition of analytes with Lewis acid/base capabilities (Sutarlie & Yang, 2008). Metalloporphyrins were nearly ideal for the detection of metal-ligating vapors because of their open coordination sites for axial ligation, their large spectral shifts upon ligand binding, and their intense coloration (Suslick et al., 2010). The sensor array was then exposed to the odor streams in the reaction chamber, and color changes were observed in the array. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its formation from nitrate under anaerobic conditions, while protons are mentioned in the context of pH indicators that respond to changes in acidity. The relationship between nitrite and protons is indirect, as nitrite concentration can influence the acidity of the environment, which in turn affects the behavior of pH indicators. However, the specific interaction between nitrite and protons is not elaborated upon, making their connection more general than direct.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect relationship, as nitrite and protons are connected through the concept of acidity and pH changes, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interaction or significance in the context provided.",
