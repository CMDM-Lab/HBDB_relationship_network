    "context": "Fig. 4 , trace A, shows an example of a simultaneous separation of anions and cations in EBC sample from a healthy volunteer with no record of any respiratory disease. Consequently, the levels of all ions fall within the ranges measured in the screening study. The trace B shows an electropherogram of the same person during an acute infection of upper respiratory tract with serious cough, elevated temperature and other symptoms of common cold. The traces A and B look very similar, except that significantly elevated level of nitrite can be found in trace B. This is also shown in the insert of figure, with zoomed portion of the electropherogram, showing the separation of chloride, nitrite, sulphate and formate (IS). The concentration of nitrite in the trace B has been determined using spiking with IS and the concentration was 7.3\u00b10.5\u03bcM, which is significantly higher than the level of nitrite before the acute respiratory tract inflammation, where nitrite was not detected and is about twice as high as the average nitrite concentration determined during the initial screening study. The trace C in the same figure, shows an electropherogram of a person with a diagnosed mild form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite and chlorides are both analyzed as anions in the electropherogram of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. While nitrite levels significantly increase during an acute upper respiratory infection, chlorides are also present but not highlighted as having a notable change. The relationship is primarily through their simultaneous measurement in the context of respiratory health, indicating their relevance in assessing respiratory conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both nitrite and chlorides are measured together in the context of respiratory health, but their specific interactions or functional relationships are not deeply explored beyond their presence in the same analysis.",
        "score": 3
