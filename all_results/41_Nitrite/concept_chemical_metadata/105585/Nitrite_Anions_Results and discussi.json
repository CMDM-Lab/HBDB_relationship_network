    "context": "BGE for CE measurements was prepared daily by diluting 100mM stock solutions of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), l-histidine (HIS, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and 18-crown-6 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) to the required concentration. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) was prepared as 10mM stock solution in 5% acetonitrile and was added to the BGE. The optimized BGE composition used in this work was 20mM MES, 20mM HIS, 30\u03bcM CTAB and 2mM 18-crown-6 at pH 6. Optimization of the BGE for simultaneous separation of anions and cations in EBC Initial CE screening of the ionic content of the EBC using a previously described BGE (20mM MES, 20mM HIS, 20\u03bcM CTAB and 1mM 18-crown-6) has shown that it contains measurable concentrations of seven anions (inorganic anions: Cl\u2212, NO2 \u2212, NO3 \u2212, SO4 2\u2212, H2PO4 \u2212, organic anions: acetate, lactate) and five inorganic cations (NH4 +, K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+). A slightly modified BGE consisting of 20mM MES, 20mM HIS, 30\u03bcM CTAB and 2mM 18-crown-6 at pH 6 was found suitable for simultaneous separation of selected anions and cations in EBC using the DOEI principle. The modification consisted of increasing the concentration of 18-crown-6 to 2mM to allow separation of large concentrations of NH4 + from K+ in the analyzed samples. Further, by employing a slightly higher concentration of CTAB (30\u03bcM) as BGE additive, the analysis time for simultaneous analysis of selected ions was decreased below 3min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is identified as one of the measurable inorganic anions present in the ionic content of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The study focuses on optimizing a background electrolyte (BGE) for the simultaneous separation of various anions, including nitrite, and cations. This indicates that nitrite is categorized as an anion within the analytical framework, but no specific interactions or functional relationships between nitrite and other anions are discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as nitrite is classified as an anion in the context of the study. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance relative to other anions.",
