    "context": "The consecutive disruption of intracellular redox balance and inflammation both contribute to skeletal muscle mobilization. Hypoxia disrupts the efficiency of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inducing leakage of electrons to molecular oxygen and thereby generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often upregulated during expeditions at high altitude, and mechanisms linked to skeletal muscle wasting include activation of HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB catabolic pathways and inhibition of the anabolic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway [27\u201329]. Nitric oxide (NO) metabolism is also influenced by oxygen availability as demonstrated by raised levels of nitrite and nitrate (markers of NO production) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a biomarker of NO activity) during acclimatization to high altitude. Therefore, physiological data and plasma samples from the 2007 Caudwell Xtreme Everest (CXE) expedition could provide valuable mechanistic insights into the relationship between hypoxia and FFM loss whereby the extended duration at high altitude serves as a pathogenic model of sarcopenia. We first assess body composition changes (FM and FFM) and fluid shifts [total body water (TBW), intracellular (ICW) and extracellular water (ECW)] that occurred during the expedition. We then evaluate the association between changes in FM and FFM with a comprehensive panel of biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, NO bioavailability, appetite control and intermediary metabolism to identify significant predictors of changes in FM and FFM during prolonged exposure to hypoxia.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrate are discussed as markers of nitric oxide (NO) production, which is influenced by oxygen availability during high-altitude expeditions. The elevation of both nitrite and nitrate levels indicates increased NO metabolism, suggesting a physiological response to hypoxia that may relate to skeletal muscle mobilization and metabolic changes. Their relationship is significant as they both serve as indicators of NO activity and its effects on the body under stress conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between nitrite and nitrate, as both are markers of nitric oxide metabolism and are discussed in the context of physiological responses to hypoxia. Their roles in indicating NO production during high-altitude exposure provide substantial evidence of their interrelatedness.",
