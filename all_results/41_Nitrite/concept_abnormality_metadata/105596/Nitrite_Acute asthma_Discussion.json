    "context": "The strong relationship of EBC NO2 \u2212 and Vt mentioned before suggests that this may result from a greater extent of pulmonary distension (at similar Vt) due to a reduction of functional lung volume in ALI/ARDS known as the \u201cbaby lung\u201d effect. This interpretation assumes a mechanism coupling nitric oxide production and lung distension. Preliminary data from our laboratory support this assumption. 9 Alternatively the increased EBC NO2 \u2212 may be caused independently by pulmonary/airway inflammation as has been demonstrated in acute asthma 11 , 26 , 27 and cystic fibrosis. 10 Pulmonary or systemic inflammation, however, does not seem to be the primary determinant of EBC NO2 \u2212 in our study for several reasons: (1) EBC NO2 \u2212 does not significantly correlate with proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 (measured in EBC and serum) or with procalcitonin; (2) the strong relation of EBC NO2 \u2212 and Vt observed in all patient subgroups independent of severity of disease may not be explained by a direct relation between inflammation and EBC NO2 \u2212; and (3) mechanical distension may influence the extent of inflammation 28 , 29 and indirectly stimulate nitric oxide production. However, inflammation is influenced by a variety of factors, and a simple strong correlation of EBC NO2 \u2212 with Vt such as the one observed here would hardly be expected. If EBC NO2 \u2212 is related to pulmonary distension, and if the available lung volume is reduced in more severe lung injury, the increase in the EBC NO2 \u2212/Vt ratio may reflect the increased alveolar distension in the remaining open units of the injured lung.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2\u2212) is discussed in relation to exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and its potential increase due to pulmonary inflammation, particularly in conditions like acute asthma. The study suggests that while EBC NO2\u2212 may rise due to airway inflammation, it is not solely determined by inflammatory markers, indicating a complex relationship where mechanical factors may also play a role in nitrite production during acute asthma episodes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and acute asthma, as the context discusses how increased EBC NO2\u2212 can be associated with pulmonary inflammation in acute asthma. However, the relationship is nuanced, involving mechanical factors, which prevents a perfect score.",
