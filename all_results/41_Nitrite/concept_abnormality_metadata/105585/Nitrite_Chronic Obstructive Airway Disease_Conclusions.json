    "context": "In this contribution it has been demonstrated that capillary electrophoresis with C4D using DOEI can be used to rapidly analyze both inorganic cations and inorganic and organic anions present in EBC. The EBC sampling relies on a simple, inexpensive in-house made device that can be constructed in any analytical laboratory. The collection time is significantly reduced; typically 1\u20132min is sufficient to collect 100\u2013200\u03bcL of EBC sample for CE analysis. It has been shown that changes of nitrite could be observed during acute inflammation of upper airways and in EBC of a person with diagnosed mild COPD, while the changes of other ions were also observed. Whether this method could possibly be used as a simple, non-invasive, point of care screening tool would however require deeper clinical study. In non-critical applications, for instance in monitoring of lactate in athletes during and after exhaustive exercise, the developed method can be used as a substitute for invasive blood sampling and testing. Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation due to chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema with lung hyperinflation which is progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung. 1 These abnormalities can be estimated by pulmonary function tests such as forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), total lung capacity (TLC), or residual volume (RV).

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is mentioned as a measurable component in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of a person diagnosed with mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study indicates that changes in nitrite levels can be observed during acute inflammation of the upper airways and in COPD, suggesting a potential link between nitrite levels and the inflammatory processes associated with this disease. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its presence in EBC samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrite is associated with COPD through its measurement in EBC, indicating a potential role in monitoring inflammation. However, the context does not provide extensive details on the specific implications of nitrite changes in COPD pathology.",
