    "context": "SCN\u2212 anion may thus serve as a simple indicator of whether the salivary contamination should be suspected. Contrary to a commonly adopted procedure, in which salivary \u03b1-amylase assay kits are used to check for salivary contamination, by using our developed method, no additional measurement is required.Analysis of EBC using DOEI CE with C4D The initial study, in which we have analyzed 75 samples of healthy, non-smoker, population for the ionic content of EBC (Table 2) may provide a starting base for an investigation of using EBC-CE\u2013C4D analysis as a possible screening method to recognize and monitor respiratory tract inflammation or other (chronic) respiratory disease. It has been shown in several studies that increased levels of nitrogen-reactive species can be found in EBC of persons with serious lung condition. For instance, elevated levels of nitrite were found in individuals with severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, and in acute lung injury. The developed CE\u2013C4D method could evolve into an alternative point of care analytical method and device, giving an extended information through simultaneous determination of anionic and cationic EBC content. A detailed study performed in a hospital facility including a statistically significant group of patients with diagnosed respiratory tract disease and the same large control group would be required to validate the usefulness our developed method. In here, we present some first promising results. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is identified as a biomarker that may indicate respiratory tract inflammation, with elevated levels found in individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis, among other severe lung conditions. The study suggests that measuring nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) could serve as a potential screening method for monitoring cystic fibrosis and related respiratory diseases, highlighting a significant relationship between nitrite and cystic fibrosis in the context of lung health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between nitrite and cystic fibrosis, as elevated nitrite levels are specifically noted in cystic fibrosis patients, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for respiratory inflammation. The context provides evidence supporting this relationship.",
