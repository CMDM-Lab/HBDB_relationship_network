The observation of increasing EBC nitrite levels with increasing extent of static hyperinflation became more evident in more advanced stages of COPD (Table 2). Inflammatory cytokines in EBC and EBC nitrite Levels of cytokines in EBC were different among the three patient groups (VOL, HS, COPD). The highest levels of all cytokines, except for IL-10, were found in the HS group and were all significantly higher compared to the stable COPD group as well as the healthy volunteers (for all cytokines: p<0.05; Fig. 4 ). IL-1\u03b2 was the only cytokine that differed significantly between stable COPD patients and healthy volunteers (p<0.004; ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are analyzed in relation to Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). The study indicates that EBC nitrite levels increase with the severity of static hyperinflation in COPD patients, suggesting a potential biomarker role for nitrite in assessing disease progression. Additionally, inflammatory cytokine levels in EBC differ among patient groups, with COPD patients showing distinct profiles compared to healthy individuals, highlighting the inflammatory aspect of the disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrite and COPD, supported by quantitative data showing increased nitrite levels correlating with disease severity. This suggests that nitrite may serve as a relevant biomarker in COPD, although further exploration of its exact role is needed.",
