    "context": "6 In this group of mechanically ventilated patients, we reported a strong correlation of tidal volume (adapted to ideal body weight) and EBC nitrite. Similar findings have also been reported by other authors demonstrating a relation between pulmonary nitric oxide release and mechanical stimuli resulting from e.g. pulmonary artery or venous pressure elevation or from high frequency oscillatory ventilation. 20,21 Finally, we have demonstrated increased levels of nitrite in BAL fluid of isolated rabbit lungs ventilated with increased tidal volumes 7 and a direct release of nitrite from mechanically stretched rat alveolar type II cells in primary culture when compared to cells under static conditions. 8 Apoptosis of structural cells in the lung has recently been recognized to be an important aspect in the pathogenesis of COPD. 22 Particularly in end-stage emphysema, a significant increase in apoptotic alveolar epithelial cells without a concomitant increase in proliferation was observed by Calabrese et al. 23 Mechanical overdistension of alveolar cells might be one reason for the observed increase in apoptosis. Several lines of investigations therefore lead to the conclusion of increased mechanical distension of the lung resulting in increased release of NO being converted to nitrite in an aqueous environment.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its release from mechanically ventilated lungs and its correlation with tidal volume. While spastic syndrome is not directly mentioned, the implications of increased nitrite levels may relate to lung function and potential respiratory complications. However, there is no explicit connection made between nitrite and spastic syndrome, limiting the relevance of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as nitrite is involved in pulmonary responses that could affect respiratory conditions, but there is no detailed discussion linking it specifically to spastic syndrome.",
