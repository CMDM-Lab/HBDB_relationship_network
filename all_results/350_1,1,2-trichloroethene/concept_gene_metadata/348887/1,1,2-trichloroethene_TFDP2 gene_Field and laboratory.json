    "context": "Concentrations were quantified using calibration curves generated from seven standards, prepared by injecting methanolic stock solutions into water and then extracting with pentane using the same pentane to water ratio and extraction time used for the samples. Dilutions of samples into deionized water were performed if required based on initial analysis of the undiluted sample. Duplicates, lab blanks and standard checks were routinely analyzed. MDLs were 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L for TCE and PCE and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L for the DCE isomers; VC was not quantified.Hydrogeochemical evaluation Hydrogeochemical sampling was conducted at selected locations along the plume flowpath in October 1999 (Phase 1) to assess the potential for reductive dechlorination: ML-10 (Transect 1), DP-2 (between Transects 1 and 2), ML-16 (Transect 2), DP-5 (between Transects 2 and 3) and ML-17 (Transect 3). Field measurements of pH, redox potential and conductivity were performed using electrodes and flow-through cells downstream of a peristaltic pump. Alkalinity was measured using a HACH\u2122 test kit. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured using CHEMetrics\u2122 test kits (0\u20132\u00a0mg/L range, detection limit 0.05\u00a0mg/L; 0\u201315\u00a0mg/L range, detection limit 0.4\u00a0mg/L) and a VVR multi-analyte photometer, with samples collected by slowly pumping into a 125\u00a0mL flask allowing overflow at the top and using self-filling ampoules.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to hydrogeochemical sampling and analysis, while the TFDP2 gene is not directly referenced or linked to TCE. The context focuses on environmental monitoring and chemical quantification without discussing any biological implications or interactions involving the TFDP2 gene. Therefore, there is no evident relationship between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and the TFDP2 gene, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct relevance or interaction.",
