    "context": "The same group later reported the introduction of a rabbit cytochrome P450 in transgenic hairy root cultures of Atropa belladonna, which also exhibited a faster metabolism of TCE. In the current study, Doty et al. described the genetic transformation of hybrid poplar plants (Populus tremula \u00d7 Populus alba) overexpressing mammalian cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The engineered trees were capable of the enhanced metabolism of five volatile toxic compounds: TCE, vinyl chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and benzene. Among the different transgenic clones tested, the most efficient one, line 78, expressed CYP2E1 at a 3.7- to 4.6-fold higher level and exhibited the highest level of TCE metabolism (>100-fold higher than in non-transgenic controls). When cultivated in hydroponic solution spiked with toxic compounds, line 78 was capable of extracting \u223c90% of TCE (compared with <3% extracted by non-transgenic controls), 99% of chloroform (compared with 20% by controls) and 92\u201394% of carbon tetrachloride (compared with 20% by controls). Enhanced metabolism of organic pollutants in transgenic plants is associated with a faster uptake, which can be explained by a steeper concentration gradient inside plant tissues. Transgenic plants were also shown to remove volatile compounds from contaminated air at a higher rate than non-transgenic controls: 79% of TCE (none removed by controls), 49% of vinyl chloride (compared with 29% by controls) and \u223c40% of benzene (compared with 13% by controls).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is metabolized by the CYP2E1 gene, which is overexpressed in genetically modified hybrid poplar plants. The study highlights that these transgenic plants exhibit significantly enhanced metabolism of TCE, with a 100-fold increase compared to non-transgenic controls. This indicates a direct and critical relationship between TCE and the CYP2E1 gene, as the gene's expression is essential for the enhanced degradation of this volatile toxic compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the CYP2E1 gene is directly responsible for the metabolism of TCE in the engineered plants, demonstrating a clear and significant relationship supported by quantitative data on metabolic efficiency.",
        "score": 5
