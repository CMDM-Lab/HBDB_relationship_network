    "context": "Their transgenic line was designed to treat chloroacetanilide herbicides by the overexpression of a gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, an enzyme involved in glutathione synthesis. Poplar trees overexpressing a mammalian cytochrome P450 Cytochrome P450s constitute a large enzyme superfamily commonly involved in the metabolism of toxic compounds. In 2000, Doty et al. described the development of transgenic tobacco plants expressing a human cytochrome P450 and capable of metabolizing trichloroethylene (TCE) 640-fold faster than wild type plants. The same group later reported the introduction of a rabbit cytochrome P450 in transgenic hairy root cultures of Atropa belladonna, which also exhibited a faster metabolism of TCE. In the current study, Doty et al. described the genetic transformation of hybrid poplar plants (Populus tremula \u00d7 Populus alba) overexpressing mammalian cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The engineered trees were capable of the enhanced metabolism of five volatile toxic compounds: TCE, vinyl chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and benzene. Among the different transgenic clones tested, the most efficient one, line 78, expressed CYP2E1 at a 3.7- to 4.6-fold higher level and exhibited the highest level of TCE metabolism (>100-fold higher than in non-transgenic controls).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile toxic compound that is metabolized by transgenic plants overexpressing the mammalian cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). However, the FASTK gene is not directly discussed or linked to the metabolism of TCE or the transgenic modifications described. The focus is primarily on the CYP2E1 enzyme's role in enhancing TCE metabolism, with no clear connection to the FASTK gene.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and the FASTK gene, as the context does not provide any discussion or evidence linking the two terms. They are mentioned in the same context but without any direct relevance.",
