CompFlow Bio is a multi-phase multi-component compositional model that considers three mobile phases, namely, the aqueous (q), non-aqueous (n) and gas (g) phases. Components are summarized as water (w), air (a) and TCE (c TCE). Assuming equilibrium partitioning of components p ={w, q, c TCE} between phases l ={q, n, g} under isothermal conditions, the conservation of moles for each component p is written as: (1) \u2202 \u2202 t \u2211 l \u03d5 S l M l X pl + \u03c1 r K dp M q X pq = \u2212 \u2211 l \u2207 \u2219 M l X pl V l + \u2211 l \u2207 \u2219 \u03d5 S l D l M l \u2207 X pl + Q p where the Darcy flux of each phase is given by: (2) V l = \u2212 K \u2219 k rl \u03bc l \u2207 P l + \u03c1 l g \u2207 z . The hydrodynamic dispersion tensor D l includes both mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion in porous medium and is given by: (3) \u03d5 S l D l = \u03b1 T l V l I + \u03b1 L l \u2212 \u03b1 T l V l V l V l + \u03d5 S l \u03c4 d l I . The four terms in Eq.\u00a0(1) each have a physically simple interpretation in the context of this work. The first term represents the accumulation of moles of a single component (i.e. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and the HOXA10 gene are mentioned in a discussion about a multi-phase compositional model, but there is no direct relationship or interaction between them. TCE is referenced as a component in a model concerning environmental factors, while HOXA10 gene is not discussed in relation to TCE or its effects. Thus, their connection is purely coincidental without any biological or chemical relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and the HOXA10 gene, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
