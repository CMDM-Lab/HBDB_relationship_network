    "context": "Along this transect, two new wells (MW5 and MW6) were installed to supplement three existing wells (MW241, MW218, and MW219). Inter-well spacing along the plume transect is \u223c10\u00a0m (Fig. 1). The deployment and retrieval of the PFMs and analyses of the silver-impregnated granular activated carbon (SI-GAC) sorbent were done following the protocol outlined in Annable et al. (2005) and Basu et al. (2006). The samples were shipped to Purdue University for GC-FID (tracers) and GC-ECD (TCE) analyses to quantify the concentrations of the five \u201cresident\u201d tracers [methanol; ethanol; isopropyl alcohol; tert-butyl alcohol; and 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol] as well as TCE and its dechlorinated by-products, cis- and trans-dichloroethylene (DCE). The cumulative, time-averaged groundwater flux, q (L3/L2/T), and contaminant flux, J (M/L2/T), are given by Eqs. (1) and (2) [see Hatfield et al., 2004; Klammler et al., 2007 for details]: (1) q = q d \u03b1 =( 1 \u2212 \u03a9 R ) r \u03b8 R d \u03b1 t (2) J = J d \u03b1 =m c \u03c0 r \u03b1 b t where q d and J d are the uncorrected groundwater and contaminant fluxes through the PFM, q and J are the corrected groundwater and contaminant fluxes through the PFM, r is the radius of the PFM cylinder, \u03b8 is the water content in the PFM, R d is the retardation of the resident tracer on the sorbent, t is the sampling duration, \u03a9 R is the relative mass of the resident tracer remaining in the PFM sorbent at the particular well depth, m c is the mass of contaminant sorbed by the PFM, b is the length of the sorbent matrix, and \u03b1 is a correction factor to account for flow convergence towards or divergence around the PFM. Note that whether there is flow convergence or divergence (the former being the preferred) is determined by the permeability contrast between the well (screen and packing), the PFM sorbent pack, and the surrounding aquifer.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant analyzed in groundwater samples, while the SHFM1 gene is not referenced or discussed. There is no indication of any relationship between TCE and the SHFM1 gene, as the context focuses solely on groundwater analysis and does not address genetic factors or their potential interactions with TCE exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and the SHFM1 gene, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
