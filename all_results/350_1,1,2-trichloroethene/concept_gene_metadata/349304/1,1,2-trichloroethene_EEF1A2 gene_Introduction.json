    "context": "Bioremediation of TCE has been thoroughly investigated in field studies after first being demonstrated in soil columns by Wilson and Wilson (1985). It has been studied under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereby microbes can achieve remediation of TCE via reductive dechlorination (e.g. Freedman and Gossett, 1989; Hopkins and McCarty, 1995; McCarty et al., 1998). The transformation of TCE to ethene proceeds via the sequential dechlorination to dichloroethylene (DCE), which has three possible isomers, then vinyl chloride (VC), before ethene (K\u00e4stner, 1991). The presence of any of these daughter products is likely on sites undergoing bioremediation via co-metabolism of TCE. Incomplete dechlorination of TCE is unhelpful or even harmful to cleanup efforts, since the daughter products dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) are also regulated toxic compounds. Due to their ubiquitous nature, microbes capable of mediating the reductive dechlorination of TCE are already present within the microbial community at most sites. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its bioremediation through microbial processes, specifically reductive dechlorination. However, there is no mention or connection to the EEF1A2 gene, which is typically associated with protein synthesis and cellular functions. The two terms appear in the same context but lack any direct or indirect relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 1,1,2-trichloroethene and EEF1A2 gene are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their relationship. They are unrelated in terms of function or interaction.",
