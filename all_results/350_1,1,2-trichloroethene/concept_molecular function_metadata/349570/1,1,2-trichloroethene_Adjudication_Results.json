    "context": "The fractional contribution of solid-phase sorption is relatively constant, as would be expected given that the phase-extent parameter of which it is a function (i.e., \u03c1b) is a constant. The contribution of accumulation at the air\u2013water interface was significant for the experiments, averaging approximately 24%. The fractional contribution for this process is a function of the magnitude of air-water interfacial area, which in turn is a function of water content. Values for AIA and \u03b8w calculated from the tracer data are used, along with other independently determined parameter values presented in Table\u00a02, to predict the retardation factors for TCE (Eq. (1)). The results are presented in Table\u00a05. Comparison of predicted and measured values results in relative errors ranging from 3 to 24%. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its behavior in solid-phase sorption and air-water interface interactions during experiments. However, there is no mention or connection to 'Adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. Thus, the two terms appear unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect connection.",
