    "context": "Data from the two matrices were used to generate CE maps that suggest similar contaminant distributions (Fig.\u00a03). Overall, contaminants from the two potential sources, the DNAPL phase and the settling basin, followed the groundwater flow direction (Fig.\u00a03, blue arrows), which caused the migration of dissolved phase products in the soil vapor and groundwater towards the pumping wells. The highest CE concentrations in tree and soil cores were found in the vicinity of the pumping wells, which induce a hydraulic containment of DNAPL. In our case study, tree cores appeared more informative than soil cores, particularly in the case of highly volatile compounds such as TCE, as the CE concentrations were higher in tree cores than in soil cores. This is mostly due to TCE concentrations that appeared to be under the quantification limit in many soil cores (Table\u00a02). Low TCE concentrations in soil cores may results from a loss of TCE by volatilization in the upper 25\u00a0cm layer of soil, due to its highly volatile properties from soil water (Dilling et\u00a0al., 1975). These results confirmed that trees are able to take up, transfer and store contaminants such as CE through their large root systems, integrating both temporal and spatial dimensions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a highly volatile compound that migrates through soil and groundwater, affecting contaminant distributions. The study highlights the ability of trees to uptake and store TCE, indicating its classification as a volatile substance. The relationship is primarily based on TCE's volatility and its behavior in environmental matrices, particularly in relation to soil and tree cores.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and volatile substances, as TCE is explicitly described as a highly volatile compound with implications for environmental contamination and uptake by trees. The context provides evidence of TCE's volatility and its impact on contaminant distribution.",
