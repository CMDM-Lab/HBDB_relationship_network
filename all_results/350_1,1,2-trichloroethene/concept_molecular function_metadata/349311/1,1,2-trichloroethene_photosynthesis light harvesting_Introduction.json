    "context": "Batch and column experiments were conducted to confirm F-NZVI stability and mobility in unsaturated porous media. The ability of F-NZVI to generate heat under an applied LF-EMF was also examined. TCE volatilization kinetics, both with and without LF-EMF, were compared to quantify the benefits of using LF-EMF together with F-NZVI. The feasibility of this combined remediation concept is discussed based on enhanced TCE evaporation and theoretical analysis of operational conditions between RFH without F-NZVI and MIH with F-NZVI to obtain similar energy dissipation. Chemicals and NZVI TCE (>99.5%) was obtained from Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). SLES was used as a foam stabilizer in this study. NZVI was procured as Nanofer 25 (NF25) (Nanoiron, Czech Republic). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to experiments involving its volatilization kinetics and remediation techniques using F-NZVI and LF-EMF. However, there is no discussion or connection to photosynthesis light harvesting, which pertains to a completely different biological process. The two terms appear in the same context but are unrelated in function or significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and photosynthesis light harvesting, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any interaction or connection.",
