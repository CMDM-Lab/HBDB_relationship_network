    "context": "This injection method substantially reduced the number of systematic errors associated with liquid injections and enhanced reproducibility. Spectroscopic analyses of the species present in the plasma during the destruction of VOCs allowed the byproducts to be detected and new pathways for the loss of chlorine and carbon to be identified. A Jobin-Yvon THR1000 monochromator with a diffraction grating of 1200grooves/mm was employed, and the output of the monochromator was connected to a LAVISION iCCD Flamestar2 intensified camera. Destruction of trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride The trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride destruction process in the air plasma was studied as a function of the applied microwave power, gas flow rate, inner diameter of the coupler tip and VOC concentration. 3.1.1 Effect of applied microwave power The principal mechanism for the decomposition of residual molecules in non-thermal plasmas is electron collision. The influence of electron collisions increase as the amount of energy released to the electrons in the plasma increases. ",
