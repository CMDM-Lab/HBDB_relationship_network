    "context": "(5a) and (5b) to estimate the dissolution (k d ) rate coefficient of the two VOCs. Fig. 6 shows plots of ln[( C max w \u2212 C w )/ C max w ] vs. time for both TCE and toluene dissolution into water, consistent with Eq. (5b). Results confirm that dissolution followed a first-order rate process. Values of the coefficient of determination (R 2) of the semi-log regressions obtained for TCE and toluene were in most or all cases equal to 0.98 or higher. The corresponding dissolution rate constants (k d ) are given in Table 2 . Results indicate that the dissolution rate constant (k d ) for TCE was slightly larger as compared to the value for toluene. The results in Fig. 6 were obtained using the approximate decoupled analytical solutions neglecting the effect of withdrawal of fluid due to sampling. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its dissolution rate into water, alongside toluene. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears without any direct connection to TCE or its dissolution process. There is no indication of how adjudication relates to the chemical properties or behaviors of TCE, making their relationship unclear and coincidental.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
