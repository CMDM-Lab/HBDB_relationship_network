    "context": "In subsequent sampling events, TCE was detected along the entire length of the column. An apparent stabilization of TCE concentrations corresponds with the observed drop in the rate of gas production. In the treatment zone the concentration of TCE remained high throughout the course of the experiment, ranging from 1066 to 1165mg/L, close to the solubility limit of TCE (1280mg/L). This was attributed to (1) incomplete oxidation of the TCE resulting in sufficient TCE remaining in the treatment zone to maintain a dissolved concentration near solubility, and (2) spatial heterogeneities in the contamination spread resulting in untreated zones of TCE. Headspace concentrations of TCE are shown in Fig. 8 . TCE vapours were detected in the headspace in the first sampling event following the permanganate injection, and continued to increase in concentration for the first six weeks of the experiment. After this point, TCE vapour concentrations remained relatively steady (around 300ppm) throughout the remainder of the experiment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its incomplete oxidation during a treatment process. The high concentrations of TCE observed suggest that the oxidation process was not fully effective, leading to significant amounts of TCE remaining in the treatment zone. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and oxidation, as the latter is crucial for reducing TCE levels in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and oxidation, as the context discusses the incomplete oxidation of TCE and its implications for treatment effectiveness. The relationship is supported by observations of TCE concentrations and the role of oxidation in its degradation.",
