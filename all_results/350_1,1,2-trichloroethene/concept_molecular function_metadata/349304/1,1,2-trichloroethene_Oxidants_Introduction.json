    "context": "Conventional pump-and-treat systems, the most widely used strategy for groundwater remediation, can be difficult to apply to TCE-contaminated aquifers (Hoffman, 1993; Mackay and Cherry, 1989). As an alternative, in-situ remediation of TCE and other dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) refers to treatment strategies that are applied in the subsurface, such as in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) and enhanced bioremediation. During ISCO remediation, an oxidant solution is released into the zone of NAPL contamination, whereby carbon-based contaminants are oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2). For TCE, the most commonly used oxidant is permanganate, which has the advantage of being effective over a wide pH range, and is relatively stable in the subsurface (Yin and Allen, 1999). The oxidation of TCE proceeds as follows: C 2 Cl 3 H + 2 MnO 4 \u2212 \u2794 2 CO 2 + 2 MnO 2 s + 3 Cl \u2212 + H + In experimental studies and applications at TCE-contaminated sites, permanganate oxidation has been found to be successful at effectively treating TCE contamination (Schnarr et al., 1998; West et al., 1997; Yan and Schwartz, 1999). In particular, permanganate oxidation can be very effective at treating source-zone contamination. However, ISCO also tends to generate CO2 gas as a result of contaminant destruction and the oxidation of soil organic matter. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is treated using in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) methods, where oxidants like permanganate are employed to remediate TCE contamination in groundwater. The oxidants facilitate the conversion of TCE into carbon dioxide and other byproducts, demonstrating a direct and critical relationship between TCE and oxidants in the remediation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly details how oxidants are used to chemically oxidize TCE, highlighting their essential role in the remediation process. This relationship is fundamental to the effectiveness of the treatment strategy.",
        "score": 5
