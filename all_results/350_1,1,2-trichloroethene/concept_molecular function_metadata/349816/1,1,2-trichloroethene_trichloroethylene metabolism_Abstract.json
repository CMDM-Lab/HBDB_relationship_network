    "context": " [7] The apparent Km and Vmax were 2.0 microM and 1.9 nmol/mg protein/10 min for substrate concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 34 microM in the 10,000g fraction.  [8] The apparent Km and Vmax for the microsomal fraction were 4.17 microM and 8.0 nmol/mg protein/10 min, respectively.  [9] Linoleic acid concentrations of 10 microM and higher reduced TCE metabolism by the 10,000g fraction, whereas oleic acid concentrations of 50 microM and higher were required to inhibit TCE metabolism. [10] Isooctane and dimethylsulfoxide caused a significant decrease in TCE metabolism. [11] The vial equilibrium technique, as described herein, is relatively simple, rapid, and reliable, and may be applicable as a standard procedure for quantifying volatile organic chemical metabolism by different tissues of different species, including humans. Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOC) have a high dissolving capacity for non-polar substances and some substantial technical advantages (simple recovery by means of distillation, high safety of burning and explosive accidents, low volatilisation temperature) and therefore open up a huge variety of uses. The most important fields of application are in metal surface degreasing, textile cleansing and food extraction. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is indirectly related to trichloroethylene (TCE) metabolism through the discussion of metabolic rates and factors affecting TCE metabolism in various tissue fractions. The study highlights how different substrates and conditions can influence the metabolism of TCE, suggesting that 1,1,2-trichloroethene may share metabolic pathways or effects with TCE, although the specific relationship is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned in the context of TCE metabolism, indicating a potential connection in metabolic pathways, but lacks detailed exploration of their direct relationship.",
