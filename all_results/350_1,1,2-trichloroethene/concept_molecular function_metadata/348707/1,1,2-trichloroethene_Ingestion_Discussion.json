    "context": "[1] It would appear that presystemic elimination is an efficient but not a perfect means of preventing exposure of extrahepatic organs of humans upon ingestion of environmentally relevant levels of well metabolized VOCs. [2] Saturation of first-pass metabolism will occur at moderate to high dosage levels, but not with the very low quantities at issue here, because their uptake is perfusion limited. [3] By use of a PBPK model,  estimated that a 10-fold increase in CYP2E1 activity in humans inhaling 10 ppm TCE for 4 h would result in only a 2% increase in TCE metabolism. [4] PBPK model simulations of an 8-h inhalation exposure to 50 ppm TCE and ingestion of 2 liters of water containing 5 ppb TCE predicted that the amount oxidized in the liver differed by only 2% in persons whose CYP2E1 content varied 10-fold . [5] Vmax used in PBPK models for TCE in humans  and rats  varied just 4- to 5-fold. [6] This result suggests that the efficiency (i.e., \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc85\u00e2\u20ac\u201c88%) of presystemic elimination of trace levels of TCE observed in the current study may not exhibit significant interindividual or interspecies differences. [7] A study is underway in our laboratory to determine whether pronounced CYP2E1 induction significantly enhances oxidation of very low TCE doses in rats. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its presystemic elimination upon ingestion. The text highlights that while ingestion of TCE at low levels leads to minimal metabolism changes, the efficiency of presystemic elimination remains high. The study emphasizes the limited impact of ingestion on TCE metabolism compared to inhalation, suggesting that ingestion does not significantly alter the metabolic processing of TCE in the liver.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between TCE and ingestion is discussed in terms of presystemic elimination and metabolism, indicating some interaction. However, the details are not extensive enough to warrant a higher score.",
