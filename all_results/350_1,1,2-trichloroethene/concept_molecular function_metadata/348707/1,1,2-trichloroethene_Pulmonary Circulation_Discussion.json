[9] Multizonal livers have been included in several PBPK models (; ; ). [10] The latter researchers incorporated a deep liver compartment into their PBPK model to account for slower than anticipated systemic TCE clearance in male S-D rats.  [1] It seems unlikely that the GI tract would contribute significantly to first-pass extraction of TCE, although the VOC is exhaled to some extent during each pass through the pulmonary circulation.  [2] The bioavailability of some drugs is limited by the presence of transporters and CYP450s in both enterocytes and hepatocytes .  [3] However, TCE and other VOCs are small, uncharged, lipophilic molecules that do not depend on transporters but readily diffuse across membranes.  [4] CYP2E1, the isoform primarily responsible for oxidation of low doses of TCE in rats and humans, has not been found in the small intestines of either species (; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its exhalation during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. The text discusses the hepatic clearance models for TCE and notes that while the gastrointestinal tract has minimal impact on TCE extraction, the compound is exhaled to some extent during its circulation through the lungs. This indicates a connection between TCE and pulmonary circulation, as the lungs play a role in the elimination of this volatile organic compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between TCE and pulmonary circulation is acknowledged through the mention of TCE being exhaled during its passage through the lungs, indicating some level of interaction, but lacking detailed exploration of the physiological implications.",
