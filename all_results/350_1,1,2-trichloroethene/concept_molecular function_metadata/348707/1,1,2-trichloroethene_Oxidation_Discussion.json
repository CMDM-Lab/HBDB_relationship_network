    "context": " [4] CYP2E1, the isoform primarily responsible for oxidation of low doses of TCE in rats and humans, has not been found in the small intestines of either species (; ).  [5] Pulmonary first-pass effect, determined primarily by a VOC's blood/air partition coefficient, is considered to be blood level-independent .  [6] reported that lung first-pass elimination accounted for \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc5 to 8% of oral doses of 0.7 to 16.0 mg TCE/kg in rats.  [7] , ) measured efficient oxidation of TCE to chloral by CYP2E1, CYP2F2, and CYP2B1 in Clara cells in mouse airways.  [8] Clara cell numbers and TCE metabolic activation are much lower in rats and largely undetectable in human lung microsomes.  [9] TCE storage in the lungs should be negligible. [10] Thus, it can be concluded that exhalation contributes modestly to presystemic elimination of TCE, but that saturable first-pass hepatic uptake is the predominant process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its oxidation by the enzyme CYP2E1, which is responsible for metabolizing TCE in both rats and humans. The text highlights the role of CYP2E1 in the efficient oxidation of TCE to chloral, indicating a significant biochemical interaction where TCE undergoes oxidation as part of its metabolic pathway. This relationship is crucial for understanding TCE's pharmacokinetics and its elimination from the body.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and oxidation, as the context provides evidence of CYP2E1's role in TCE's metabolic oxidation. The discussion includes specific details about the enzymatic process, indicating a clear biochemical relationship.",
