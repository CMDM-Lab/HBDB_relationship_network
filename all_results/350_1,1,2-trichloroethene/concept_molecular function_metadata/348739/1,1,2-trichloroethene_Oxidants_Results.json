    "context": "There appears to be a negative correlation between q d and C f values, i.e., high C f corresponds to low q d values (Fig. 4A). This behavior is typical of old sites where a portion of the DNAPL mass residing in the high-flow zones would have been depleted, with some recalcitrant mass left behind in the relatively low-flow zones, thus modifying the source-zone architecture (e.g., Parker et al., 2003). Release of residual TCE mass from the low-permeability zones into the more-permeable zones is diffusion-controlled, leading to persistence of dissolved plumes (e.g., Mackay, 1998; Chapman and Parker, 2005). In such cases, aggressive remediation involving in-situ flushing techniques (for delivery of cosolvents, surfactants, oxidants, etc.) is inefficient due to limited hydrodynamic accessibility of the residual TCE located within the low-flow zones (EPA, 2003). The nature of TCE flux and mass distribution in the lower aquifer zone (Q3 aquifer) was a major unknown in all previous site characterization efforts. Initially the contamination was assumed to be limited to the Q2 sub-aquifer (13\u201320\u00a0m bgs). However, more recent groundwater monitoring and PFM data (Fig. 3A) indicated that TCE has reached the lower aquifer zone (up to \u223c31\u00a0m bgs), but the residual TCE mass, and thus, TCE fluxes, are now generally small except at a few locations.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its persistence in groundwater and the challenges of remediation. While oxidants are mentioned as part of the remediation strategy, there is no direct discussion of how oxidants specifically interact with TCE. The focus is more on the behavior of TCE in low-flow zones rather than its chemical relationship with oxidants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both TCE and oxidants are part of the remediation discussion, but their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed in the context provided.",
