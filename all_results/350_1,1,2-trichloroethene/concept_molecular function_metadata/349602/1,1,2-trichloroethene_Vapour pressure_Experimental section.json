    "context": "2.2.4 Sequential dosing isotherm method Isotherms were obtained for uncoated and coated materials using an automated sequential dosing method. Equilibrium sorption isotherms for LHA were collected in an associated study (Bell and LeBoeuf, in press). In order to evaluate equilibrium behavior of TCE onto these model soils, a sequential dosing method with the Micromeretics ASAP 2010 was used. The ASAP 2010 is equipped with a hydrocarbon manifold so liquids that possess a vapor pressure of at least 1mm Hg at room temperature and <10\u03bcm Hg at liquid nitrogen temperature could be used as sorbates in obtaining equilibrium isotherms (TCE meets this requirement). Vapor phase equilibrium isotherms were collected at experimental temperatures of 15\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C, 75\u00b0C, 95\u00b0C, and 115\u00b0C corresponding to three temperatures above and three temperatures below the glass transition temperature of LHA (Tg =74\u00b13\u00b0C (DeLapp et al., 2004)). Samples were degassed on one of two degas ports. Degas temperatures were 105\u00b0C for all samples with the exception of the highest temperature isotherms at 115\u00b0C in which case the degas temperature was 115\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is evaluated for its equilibrium sorption behavior on model soils using a sequential dosing method. The study highlights that TCE possesses a vapor pressure of at least 1 mm Hg at room temperature, which is a critical property for its use as a sorbate in obtaining vapor phase equilibrium isotherms. The relationship between TCE and vapor pressure is significant as it determines the conditions under which TCE can be effectively studied in sorption experiments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between TCE and vapor pressure, as the vapor pressure is a key property that enables the use of TCE in the experimental setup for sorption isotherms. The context provides specific details about the vapor pressure requirement for TCE, indicating its relevance in the study.",
