    "context": "This study focuses particularly on the stream zone at the border of the contaminant plume, where degradation reactions are able to control the evolution of the plume, as observed by Wilson et al. (2004). Each microbial community has different characteristics and is formed through the interaction between other microorganisms according to the surrounding environment (Watson et al., 2008). For this reason, it is more important to gain an understanding of microbial communities rather than each type of microorganism. In recent years, analysis of 16S rRNA genes has been used to understand the presence and activity of key organisms such as Dehalococcoides, and to confirm the presence of microorganisms responsible for dechlorination processes at TCE- or PCE-contaminated sites (Fennell and Gossett, 1998; Miller et al., 2007; Nijenhuis et al., 2007; Imfeld et al., 2008a, 2008b; Abe et al., 2009; Maphosa et al., 2010; Imfeld et al., 2011; Tiehm and Schmidt, 2011; Kotik et al., 2013). In relation to evaluating the natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes, the possibility of biodegradation based on geochemical data (groundwater concentration and isotopic ratio of chlorinated contaminants) around the downgradient in the study area has previously been suggested (Kaown et al., 2014a). However, although the potential of biodegradation has been proposed, further investigation is required to obtain more detailed evidence of biodegradation, such as the presence and distribution of dechlorinating bacteria. In addition, where there is a contaminated site adjacent to the stream (such as at the study site), it is important for water resource management to assess whether the stream water has been affected by the contaminant plume.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to microbial communities and their role in the biodegradation processes of chlorinated contaminants. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding these microbial processes rather than focusing solely on individual microorganisms. However, the specific relationship between TCE and the broader concept of 'Process' is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on microbial interactions and degradation mechanisms rather than a defined process involving TCE.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and the concept of 'Process.' While TCE is involved in degradation processes, the context does not provide a detailed discussion of how TCE specifically relates to or influences these processes.",
