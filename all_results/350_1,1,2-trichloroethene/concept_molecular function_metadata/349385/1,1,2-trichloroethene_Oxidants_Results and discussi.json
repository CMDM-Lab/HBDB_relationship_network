    "context": "In addition, concentrations of TCE accounted for between 97.2% and 99.2% of the molar fraction of total VOCs. These results meant that the strong oxidants O2 and NO3 \u2212 have not been fully consumed as electron acceptors in the upgradient area. Furthermore, anaerobic condition with high concentrations of Fe2+ and Mn2+ and low concentrations of DO and NO3 \u2212 was found in the streamside zone of the downgradient area, within which the TCE molar fraction accounted for 0.2 to 8.2% of the total VOCs found around the stream, as presented in Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3. The change of geochemical parameters in the downgradient area indicates that TCE started to serve as electron acceptor following consumption of the oxidants O2 and NO3 \u2212. The trend of the redox condition and the distribution of the VOC's molar fraction from the main source zone to the stream indicated that reductive dechlorination was occurring in the downgradient area, especially around the stream.Compound-specific carbon stable isotope analysis The measured \u03b413C values of TCE and cis-DCE are shown in Table 2. Most of the measured \u03b413C values of TCE ranged from \u221224.7\u2030 to \u221217.7\u2030 (mean value, \u221222.4\u2030). The observed \u03b413C of cis-DCE values ranged from \u221229.1\u2030 to \u221223.8\u2030 (mean value, \u221227.1\u2030). It was apparent that the values of \u03b413C were affected by whether or not degradation of TCE had occurred, and it appeared that generally the \u03b413C values of TCE were depleted in the upgradient area (Fig. 4a).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to oxidants, specifically oxygen (O2) and nitrate (NO3\u2212), which are electron acceptors in the environment. The study indicates that as these oxidants are consumed, TCE begins to act as an electron acceptor, suggesting a shift in redox conditions that facilitates reductive dechlorination processes. This highlights a significant interaction where TCE's role is influenced by the presence and consumption of oxidants in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between TCE and oxidants, as the context provides evidence of TCE's role as an electron acceptor following the consumption of oxidants, indicating a clear relationship in the biochemical processes occurring in the downgradient area.",
        "score": 4
