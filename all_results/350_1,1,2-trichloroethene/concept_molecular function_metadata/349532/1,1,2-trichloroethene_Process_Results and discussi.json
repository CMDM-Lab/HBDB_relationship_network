    "context": "This indicates that the heating of the sand layers was primarily due to steam convection and heat conduction, while the injected hot air lost its heat and decreased to room temperature quickly. While the steam and air injection was in progress the evaporation of TCE was enhanced due to the increasing temperature, and the vapor TCE was swept by the air and moved forward; however, the vapor TCE condensed at the steam front due to the temperature drop, while the air with the remaining TCE vapor, which was at saturation concentration under the local temperature, kept moving forward and eventually left the sandbox from the outflow pipe. At the same time, evaporation of the pore water was also enhanced by heating and experienced the same movement, followed in the same way by condensation at the steam front due to the drop in temperature. The same processes of heating, evaporating, and condensing were then repeated in the residual TCE behind (upstream of) the steam front, and in the condensed TCE at the steam front as well. The result was that as the steam front moved, part of the TCE was continuously removed with the air flow, and part remained in the NAPL phase or in aqueous phase dissolved in the water, and moved forward with the steam front. Sudan IV is not volatile and could only move with the liquid phase TCE. When vapor TCE condensed, it dissolved the Sudan IV nearby; therefore part of the Sudan IV also accumulated at the steam front, causing the condensed TCE to look darker, while at the same time some residual Sudan IV remained at the original locations.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a thermal process where it undergoes evaporation and condensation due to temperature changes during steam injection. The heating of sand layers enhances TCE evaporation, and the vapor is carried away by air, while some TCE condenses at the steam front. This illustrates TCE's role in a specific environmental remediation process, highlighting its behavior under thermal conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and the described process, as the context provides detailed mechanisms of TCE's evaporation and condensation during thermal treatment, indicating its relevance in environmental processes.",
