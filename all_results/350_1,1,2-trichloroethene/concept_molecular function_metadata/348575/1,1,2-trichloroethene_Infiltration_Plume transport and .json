    "context": "The groundwater impact of radial TCE vapour migration from the shallow, emplaced covered TCE DNAPL source of Conant et al. (1996) at the Borden site was observed by Rivett (1995). The development of a laterally extensive near water table groundwater plume was attributed to dissolution of vapours into pore waters and water table rise. The combined Borden data of Rivett (1995) and Conant et al. (1996) could be further simulated to examine unsaturated zone \u2014 groundwater zone VOC exchange processes and provide some field-scale validation of available modelling approaches (Jang and Aral, 2007; Thomson et al., 1997). Thomson et al. (1997) simulated shallow NAPL TCE source cases with and without water/gas partitioning and with variable \u03bb H values. Similar to other modelling studies they confirmed the dominant pathway for VOC incorporation to groundwater was via NAPL volatilisation and subsequent dissolution into infiltrating pore water (Jang and Aral, 2007; Mendoza and Frind, 1990b; Mendoza and McAlary, 1990; Thomson et al., 1997). Thomson et al. concluded that the water and gas phases concentrations in the NAPL source vicinity and plumes developed in the unsaturated zone as well as fluxes ultimately discharged at ground surface or to groundwater were most sensitive to the water/gas partition rate, \u03bbH, rather than NAPL volatilisation and dissolution rates. Although the analytical modelling approaches of Troldborg et al. (2009) do not permit the flexibility of numerical codes, they likewise endorsed the influence of water/gas partitioning. Troldborg et al. simulated lower concentration source/plume scenarios (Fig.\u00a02) and determined that degradation and horizontal spreading, ascribed to partitioning to and diffusion in the gas phase, were the most important attenuating mechanisms.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its migration and dissolution processes affecting groundwater. The infiltration of TCE vapors into pore waters is highlighted as a significant pathway for VOC incorporation into groundwater, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and the infiltration process. The modeling studies referenced confirm that TCE's behavior in the unsaturated zone and its subsequent impact on groundwater are influenced by its volatilization and dissolution characteristics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and infiltration, as the context discusses how TCE vapors migrate and dissolve into groundwater, supported by modeling studies that emphasize the importance of these processes.",
        "score": 4
