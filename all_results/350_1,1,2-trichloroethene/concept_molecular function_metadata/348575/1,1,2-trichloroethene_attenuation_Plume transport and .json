    "context": "Aerobic cometabolism may be easily overlooked, but potentially occurs in multi-contaminant CAH plumes. Frascari et al. (2006) demonstrated fairly recalcitrant CAHs such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane may degrade aerobically via methane- and propane-utilizing biomasses. They also showed VC may serve as a growth substrate in CAH mixtures. Freedman et al. (2001) likewise studied VC in microcosms based upon observations at a Californian TCE/1,1,1-TCA site where VC attenuation was found in aerobic down-gradient groundwater with methane and ethane present, potentially a common site scenario. Microcosms confirmed methane and ethene were primary substrates for VC aerobic degradation with rates fastest with ethene alone (methane inhibited rates). Freedman et al. also ran VC-only microcosms and demonstrated VC after a lag period served as a primary growth substrate with enriched cultures able to cometabolically biodegrade additions of cis-/trans-DCE. Hence VC as a sole substrate may play an active role in aerobic attenuation of DCEs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is indirectly related to the concept of attenuation through the study of volatile compounds like vinyl chloride (VC) in multi-contaminant plumes. The research highlights how VC can serve as a growth substrate for microbial communities that facilitate the aerobic degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), including TCE. While TCE itself is not directly mentioned in relation to attenuation, the findings suggest that its degradation may be influenced by the presence of other substrates and microbial activity, indicating a potential pathway for attenuation in contaminated environments.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is part of a broader discussion on the attenuation of chlorinated compounds through microbial processes, but its specific relationship to attenuation is not explicitly detailed.",
