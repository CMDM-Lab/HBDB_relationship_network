    "context": "On the other hand, the photodegradation pathways of chlorohydrocarbons could mainly contributed to a direct photolysis and Cl radical initiated/sensitized oxidation reactions. This implied that CCl bond in chlorohydrocarbon molecules might be cleaved upon adsorption of UV light irradiation, and the generated Cl free radial may subsequently offence the molecule to accelerate the degradation rate. In order to have a kinetic comparison of the photolytic and photocatalytic degradation of these vapors, the apparent zero-order reaction rate constants were calculated and presented in Table 1 . It can be seen that the photodegradation rate for the VOCs studied through photolysis followed an order: TCE>chloroform>dichloromethane>toluene>benzene>carbon tetrachloride, and through photocatalysis followed an order: TCE>chloroform>toluene>dichloromethane>benzene>carbon tetrachloride.Photocatalytic degradation of benzene over several catalysts It has been experimentally testified that benzene could not be degraded through photolysis but could be done, despite slowly, through photocatalysis under irradiation of germicidal lamp. Thus, photocatalytic degradation of benzene as a typical compound was performed to evaluate the prepared catalysts. An apparent zero-order kinetic equation was applied to extract the reaction rate constants. As shown in Fig. 3 , one could observe that the activity P25 TiO2 was enhanced by depositing 0.5wt% of Ag, but Pt deposited catalyst was not superior to P25 TiO2. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) undergoing photodegradation, with comparisons made to other chlorohydrocarbons. The term 'catalyst' is referenced in relation to photocatalytic degradation processes, indicating that catalysts are used to enhance the degradation of compounds like benzene. However, there is no direct discussion of how TCE specifically interacts with or is affected by any catalysts in the degradation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both terms are related to the degradation of VOCs, but there is no direct interaction or specific relationship established between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and catalysts in the context provided.",
