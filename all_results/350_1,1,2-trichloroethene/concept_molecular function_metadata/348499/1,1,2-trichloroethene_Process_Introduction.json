    "context": "Since the density of TCE is greater than that of water, TCE seeps down below the water table and causes widespread contamination of soils and underground aquifers. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane is widely used as a landfill liner or vertical wall for the purpose of containment of hazardous waste and contaminated groundwater. HDPE geomembrane mitigates the mass transfer of aqueous and inorganic contaminants effectively. However, volatile organic compounds such as CVOCs (e.g., TCE) can readily permeate through HDPE geomembrane by the partition\u2013diffusion process [6\u20139]. Several researches have been conducted to mitigate the mass transfer of CVOCs through geomembrane. The research of Sangam and Rowe demonstrated that surface fluorination of HDPE geomembrane reduced permeation coefficients 1.5\u20134.5 times less than those of non-treated geomembrane. However, a guideline concerning the thickness required to prevent the mass transfer of certain CVOC was not provided. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its environmental impact, particularly its ability to permeate through high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes used for containing hazardous waste. The process of partition-diffusion is highlighted as a mechanism by which TCE contaminates groundwater, prompting research into methods to mitigate this mass transfer. The relationship emphasizes the need for effective processes to prevent TCE contamination in environmental management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and the process of mass transfer through geomembranes, supported by research findings on mitigation strategies. The context provides evidence of TCE's environmental impact and the importance of understanding the processes involved in its containment.",
