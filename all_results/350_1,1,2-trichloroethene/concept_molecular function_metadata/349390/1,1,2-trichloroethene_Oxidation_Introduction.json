    "context": "However, VPRBs are not suitable for the unsaturated zone because of generally limited horizontal flow in the unsaturated zone. Horizontal permeable reactive barriers (HPRBs), on the other hand, can be employed in the unsaturated zone to prevent or limit the vertical leaching of contaminants (Siegrist et\u00a0al., 1998; Mackova et\u00a0al., 2006; Leal et\u00a0al., 2013) or the upward migration of contaminant vapors. The potential of dry solid potassium permanganate granules for oxidizing various VOCs has been reported in the literature (Mahmoodlu et\u00a0al., 2013, 2014b). The oxidation of TCE, toluene, and ethanol is described by the following overall reaction equations: (1) C 2 H C l 3 ( g ) + 2 K M n O 4 ( s ) \u2192 2 K + + 2 M n O 2 ( s ) + 3 C l \u2212 + 2 C O 2 ( g ) + H + (2) C 6 H 5 C H 3 ( g ) + 12 KMn O 4 ( s ) + 2 H 2 O \u2192 12 K + + 12 O H \u2212 + 12 Mn O 2 ( s ) + 7 C O 2 ( g ) (3) C 2 H 5 O H ( g ) + 4 KMn O 4 ( s ) \u2192 4 K + + 4 O H \u2212 + 4 Mn O 2 ( s ) + 2 C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 O Our recent study of VOC vapor diffusion through a partially-saturated permeable reactive barrier showed that water saturation has a considerable effect on the removal capacity of a HPRB (Mahmoodlu et\u00a0al., 2014b). The study also found that changes in pH values generated during the VOC oxidations according to their stoichiometric reactions (Eqs. (1)\u2013(3)) are responsible for reducing the oxidation rates of the VOCs. Although that study showed that the prevailing chemical processes and water saturation strongly affected the reactivity and longevity of a HPRB, it remained unclear how HPRB thickness, its location relative to the water table, and water availability in general would affect the oxidation process, and consequently the reactivity and longevity of the HPRB in the unsaturated zone.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can undergo oxidation using potassium permanganate in a permeable reactive barrier (HPRB) system. The oxidation process is part of a broader discussion on the effectiveness of HPRBs in treating VOCs in the unsaturated zone. However, the specific oxidation reaction for TCE is not detailed, and the focus is more on the general oxidation capabilities of the reactive barrier rather than a direct relationship with TCE itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is included in a discussion about oxidation processes for VOCs, but there is no detailed exploration of its specific oxidation mechanism or significance in the context.",
