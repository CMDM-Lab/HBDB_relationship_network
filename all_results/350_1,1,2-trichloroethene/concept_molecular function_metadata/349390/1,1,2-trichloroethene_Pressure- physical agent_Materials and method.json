    "context": "For the second experiment we used 80\u00a0g of each, so that the layer thickness was 8.0\u00a0cm. We also carried out a series of control experiments without potassium permanganate for all target compounds. All experiments were conducted in duplicate in a fume cabinet at room temperature (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C). We assumed that the temperature and pressure inside the columns remained constant and were equal to room temperature and atmospheric pressure, respectively.VOC transport experiments The VOC transport experiments started by switching the column inflow from DI water to one of the stock solutions containing dissolved concentrations of 130\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121, 50\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121, and 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121 for TCE, toluene, and ethanol, respectively. We measured the concentration of dissolved VOC in the stock solutions and also at the inlet and outlet ports during the experiments. Aqueous samples of 1.5\u00a0ml were taken periodically for this purpose using 2.5-ml gas-tight syringes. Gas samples of 1.5\u00a0ml were taken systematically from the headspace of both the reactive columns (containing HPRB) and the control columns using gas-tight syringes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to VOC transport experiments, where the conditions, including pressure, are assumed to be constant at atmospheric levels. However, the relationship between TCE and pressure is not explicitly discussed, and pressure is treated as a physical condition rather than a factor influencing TCE behavior or properties. Thus, while both terms are present, their connection lacks depth and specificity.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 1,1,2-trichloroethene and pressure are mentioned in the context of VOC transport experiments. However, there is no detailed discussion of how pressure specifically affects TCE or its transport, limiting the relevance of their relationship.",
