    "context": "Indeed, preliminary simulations based on our two alternative hypotheses (e.g., assuming manganese dioxide and consequent coating of the reactive surface of potassium permanganate, or depletion of potassium permanganate mass and consequently reduction of its concentration in the water phase) could not describe the experimental data. The model in this case accurately described the observed breakthrough curves of TCE and toluene vapors in the headspace. Modeling results confirmed the controlling effect of pH on the oxidation rate of TCE and toluene by potassium permanganate (Fig.\u00a02). While the oxidation rate was negligible at relatively long times, with the concentrations of TCE and toluene in the headspace reaching the corresponding concentrations of the control experiments, the oxidation rate for the ethanol experiment decreased only slightly and remained constant during the experiment due to produced water (Fig.\u00a02). 4.2.3 Distribution of VOC concentrations for the HPRB placed 7.0\u00a0cm above the water table Fig.\u00a03 compares the simulated VOC concentrations in the headspace with our experimental data when the partially-saturated HPRB (S w \u00a0=\u00a00.2) was placed 7.0\u00a0cm above the water table, while again also including the control experiments. The lower plots in this figure provide close-ups of the reactive transport data in the upper plots. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its oxidation by potassium permanganate, with the study modeling the oxidation rate of TCE and toluene. The results indicate that pH significantly influences the oxidation rate of TCE, suggesting a direct relationship between TCE and the oxidation process. However, the details of the oxidation mechanism or the specific outcomes of TCE oxidation are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and oxidation, as the study provides evidence of how pH affects the oxidation rate of TCE by potassium permanganate. This indicates a clear relationship, although the exact mechanisms are not fully detailed.",
        "score": 4
