    "context": "The build-up of VOC concentrations in the headspace was much slower for the columns with a thicker HPRB. The increased exposure time to more potassium permanganate within the thicker HPRB, and also the non-uniform change in pH during upward diffusion of the VOCs, clearly did lead to higher efficiency and longevity of the HPRB. A reactive transport model that included diffusion of VOCs in the gas and water phases, dissolution of VOCs from gas into the soil water, and oxidation of dissolved VOCs by dissolved potassium permanganate could satisfactorily simulate the experimental data. For the TCE and toluene experiments with the HPRB placed 12.0\u00a0cm above the water table, we needed to include the effect of pH changes on the oxidation rate in order accurately describe the data. However, the simulations for ethanol vapor transport were conducted without the effect of pH since the production of water due to the oxidation process prevented major change in pH. Simulations of all cases when the HPRB was placed 7.0\u00a0cm above the water table did not require us to account for any changes in pH. This could be explained by diffusion of protons or/and hydroxide ions away from the HPRB, especially downwards to the higher water saturation area. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a reactive transport model where its oxidation is facilitated by potassium permanganate in the presence of varying pH levels. The study highlights the importance of oxidation in the degradation of TCE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during their transport through soil and water phases, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and the oxidation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and oxidation, as the context discusses the role of oxidation in the degradation of TCE, supported by experimental data and modeling. The relationship is clear and relevant to the chemical processes involved.",
