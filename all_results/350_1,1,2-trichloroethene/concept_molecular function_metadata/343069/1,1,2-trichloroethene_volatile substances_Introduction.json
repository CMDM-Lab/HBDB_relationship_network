    "context": "It was shown that this technique is appropriate for a wide polarity range of organic compounds since high selectivity can be achieved due to applying different organic solvents as acceptor phase; such as cyclohexane for more unpolar compounds like PCBs, and ethyl acetate for more polar compounds like phenols and chlorophenols [18\u201322]. In LVI the solvent is removed through the open split valve and the analytes are trapped in the liner. If the boiling points of the analytes and the solvent are similar, losses of the analytes occur, since they are removed with the solvent through the open split valve. For volatile compound such as chloroform (boiling point: 61\u00b0C), trichloroethylene (boiling point: 74\u00b0C) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (boiling point: 87\u00b0C) large volume injection is not suitable in combination with an organic solvent compatible with MASE and also with GC\u2013MS (like cyclopentane or cyclohexane). The aim of the work was to develop a new model of MASE combined with a conventional split/splitless injector in order to analyze VOCs in aqueous samples. Therefore, smaller membrane bags (2cm long, wall thickness: 0.03mm, internal diameter: 6mm) were produced and filled with 100\u03bcl of an organic solvent. One microlitre of the organic extract were then injected into a conventional split/splitless injector of a GC-ECD system. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a volatile compound among others like chloroform and trichloroethylene, which are discussed in relation to their boiling points and the challenges of analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using large volume injection techniques. The focus is on the suitability of different solvents for extracting and analyzing these volatile substances, indicating that 1,1,2-trichloroethene is part of a broader category of volatile substances but lacks a specific interaction or detailed relationship with them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is categorized with other volatile substances in the context of analytical techniques, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific properties or interactions with the other compounds mentioned.",
