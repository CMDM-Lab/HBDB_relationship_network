    "context": "[6] Kinetic constants were analyzed using a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model and the computer software SimuSolv. [7] Statistical optimization using the maximum-likelihood method produced apparent in vitro Vmax and KM values of 0.55 nmol/mg protein/min and 0.9 microM, respectively. [8] In addition, this newly developed methodology has a number of advantages over those reported in the literature, including the potential utility of determining tissue partition coefficients of VOCs for physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling. [9] We conclude that this gas-liquid system is suitable for determination of kinetic constants near realistic environmental concentrations of VOCs including TCE.  [1] A study was undertaken, using 1,1,2-trichloroethylene (TCE), to: a) evaluate and improve the efficiency of the vial equilibration method, as first reported by Sato and Nakajima (Toxicol.  [2] Appl.  [3] Pharmacol. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to a study evaluating its kinetic constants and the efficiency of a vial equilibration method for pharmacokinetic modeling. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding 'adjudication' in relation to TCE, making their relationship unclear and coincidental at best.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
