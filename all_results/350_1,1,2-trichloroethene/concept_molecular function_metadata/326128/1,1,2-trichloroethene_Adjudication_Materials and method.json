    "context": "TCE was added to the ampules in the form of a TCE\u2013methanol solution to yield an aqueous phase TCE concentration of 60ppm. The ampules were immediately sealed and incubated for 48h. The MSB in the ampules was sampled and analyzed for TCE. Ampules containing no inoculum served as controls.Determination of the TCE-degradation ability of the hexadecane-degrading microorganism Prior to the start of experiments to determine the ability of the HDM to increase the bioavailability of TCE by degrading hexadecane, information was needed about its ability to degrade TCE. This experiment was conducted in 10ml ampules containing 2.5ml of MSB, hexadecane (100\u03bcl) and 5ppm TCE. A 100\u03bcl of the resuspended cells was used as an inoculum. The TCE was added in the form of a TCE\u2013methanol solution. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a chemical compound used in experiments to assess its degradation by microorganisms. However, the term 'Adjudication' does not appear to have any direct relevance or connection to TCE or its degradation processes. The context focuses solely on the experimental setup involving TCE without discussing any adjudicative processes or decisions related to it.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
