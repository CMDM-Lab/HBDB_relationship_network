    "context": "G4 utilized nearly all of the TCE for samples treated initially with 60, 120, 240, 480 and 600ppm phenol. Statistical analyses of these data proved that the reduction in TCE by G4 was highly significant. Even with no initial phenol, G4 utilized 60% of the total TCE (corrected using Henry\u2019s constant), thus indicating that G4 remained induced for TOM for a substantial period of time. There was no significant reduction in TCE concentration when the initial phenol concentration was 1200ppm indicating that this phenol concentration was inhibitory.The effects of PM-100 clay on TCE degradation by G4 The effects of PM-100 clay on TCE utilization by G4 conducted in the ampules are shown in Fig. 5 . The statistical analysis of the data showed a highly significant difference between the controls and the treatment with G4 for initial TCE concentrations of 10, 20 and 30ppm. A possible explanation is that G4 significantly lowered the aqueous TCE concentration so that the equilibrium driving force was in favor of the MSB.Determination of the TCE-degrading ability of the HDM TCE degradation by the HDM was assessed by measuring the loss of TCE and an increase in the chloride ion concentration. The results of the TCE and chloride ion analyses did not show a significant difference at the 0.05 level of significance between the treatments with the HDM and the control without the HDM. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by a microbial strain (G4) and the impact of phenol as an inhibitor. The study indicates that at higher concentrations of phenol (1200ppm), TCE degradation is significantly inhibited, suggesting that phenol acts as an inhibitor to the microbial degradation process of TCE. However, the relationship between TCE and inhibitors is primarily focused on phenol's inhibitory effects rather than a broader discussion of inhibitors in general.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the inhibitory effects of phenol on the degradation of TCE, indicating a specific interaction. However, the term 'inhibitors' is not elaborated upon beyond this specific example, limiting the depth of the relationship.",
