    "context": "Subsequently, the trap was heated to 180\u00b0C for 5min. The organics volatilized from the trap were introduced into a gas chomatograph (GC) via 1/4in. stainless steel tubing. TCE was quantitated using a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II GC equipped with an OI analytical photon ionization detector (PID). The detector temperature was maintained at 180\u00b0C. The injector temperature was 275\u00b0C. The GC was equipped with a 30m Restek RTX-5 0.53 diameter capillary column. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a photon ionization detector (PID). The ionization process is crucial for quantifying TCE as it volatilizes from the trap and is introduced into the GC. However, the relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the method of detection rather than a deeper chemical or biological interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as TCE is analyzed through a method that involves ionization, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship beyond the technical procedure.",
        "score": 2
