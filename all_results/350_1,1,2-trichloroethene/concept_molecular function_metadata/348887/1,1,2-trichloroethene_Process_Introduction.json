    "context": "The transect approach was applied with intensive monitoring of contaminant distribution in the aquifer using depth-discrete techniques along cross-sections orthogonal to groundwater flow for reliable assessment of maximum concentrations in the plume, and to be used with groundwater flux estimates for estimating changes in plume mass discharge along the plume flow path. A shallow pond and small tributary streams occur within the plume area upgradient of the river. The goal was to determine the trends in TCE and degradation products along the subsurface flow paths and also in the pond and streams at many locations to identify the mechanisms causing plume attenuation. The fate of the VOC mass in the various components of the hydrogeologic system was examined to determine why so little of the subsurface TCE mass emanating from the DNAPL source makes its way via the aquifer to the river (i.e. to document processes causing apparent strong plume attenuation). This is the first well-documented field study where the TCE mass originating at a subsurface DNAPL source has been tracked through a complex hydrologic system involving an aquifer connected to a pond, small streams and a river, each receiving a component of the plume mass discharge. The site, located in Connecticut, was used for manufacturing of metal products from 1952 to 2001. TCE was the primary solvent used for degreasing until the early 1970s, and was stored in underground tanks at the east side of the facility (Fig. 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to the processes involved in its degradation and attenuation within a hydrogeologic system. The study aims to understand the mechanisms affecting TCE mass discharge from a subsurface source through an aquifer to a river, highlighting the processes that influence the fate of TCE and its degradation products in the environment. However, the term 'Process' is used broadly without specific details on the exact processes being examined.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TCE is central to the study of environmental processes affecting its degradation and transport. While the relationship is significant, the term 'Process' lacks specificity, preventing a higher score.",
