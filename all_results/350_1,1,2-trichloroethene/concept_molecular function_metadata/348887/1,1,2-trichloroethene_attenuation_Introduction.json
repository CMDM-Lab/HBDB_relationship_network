    "context": "The transect approach was applied with intensive monitoring of contaminant distribution in the aquifer using depth-discrete techniques along cross-sections orthogonal to groundwater flow for reliable assessment of maximum concentrations in the plume, and to be used with groundwater flux estimates for estimating changes in plume mass discharge along the plume flow path. A shallow pond and small tributary streams occur within the plume area upgradient of the river. The goal was to determine the trends in TCE and degradation products along the subsurface flow paths and also in the pond and streams at many locations to identify the mechanisms causing plume attenuation. The fate of the VOC mass in the various components of the hydrogeologic system was examined to determine why so little of the subsurface TCE mass emanating from the DNAPL source makes its way via the aquifer to the river (i.e. to document processes causing apparent strong plume attenuation). This is the first well-documented field study where the TCE mass originating at a subsurface DNAPL source has been tracked through a complex hydrologic system involving an aquifer connected to a pond, small streams and a river, each receiving a component of the plume mass discharge. The site, located in Connecticut, was used for manufacturing of metal products from 1952 to 2001. TCE was the primary solvent used for degreasing until the early 1970s, and was stored in underground tanks at the east side of the facility (Fig. 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its behavior in an aquifer system, particularly focusing on the mechanisms causing plume attenuation. The study aims to understand how TCE and its degradation products are distributed and how various hydrologic components contribute to the reduction of TCE mass as it moves through the subsurface environment. The emphasis is on identifying the processes that lead to the observed attenuation of TCE concentrations in the plume.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and attenuation, as the study investigates the specific mechanisms causing the reduction of TCE mass in the aquifer system, supported by detailed monitoring and analysis.",
