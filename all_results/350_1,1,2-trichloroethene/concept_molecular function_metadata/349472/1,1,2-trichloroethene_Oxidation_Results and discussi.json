    "context": "The increase in the reactivity of the permeable reactive layer due to added water is attributed to a reduction in the proton concentrations. This allows the reaction to continue until protons accumulated again to previous levels. Similar to the TCE oxidation experiment, the reactivity of the permeable reactive layer towards toluene and ethanol decreased during the experiments. However, in contrast to the TCE oxidation experiment, and in accordance with Eqs. (2) and (3), the produced hydroxide ion increased the pH in the water phase (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014). Oxidation rate of aromatic rings have been shown to decrease with increasing basicity of the water phase (Forsey, 2004; Lobachev et al., 1997; Rudakov and Loachev, 1994). We hence expected the oxidation rate of toluene to decrease during the toluene experiments (as basicity increased). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to oxidation processes occurring in a permeable reactive layer. The text indicates that the oxidation rate of TCE is influenced by the pH and basicity of the water phase, suggesting that the reactivity of TCE during oxidation experiments is affected by changes in proton concentrations. However, the focus is primarily on the oxidation of aromatic compounds like toluene, with TCE serving as a comparative example rather than the main subject of oxidation discussion.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TCE is mentioned in the context of oxidation processes, indicating some interaction. However, the primary focus is on toluene, and TCE's role is more illustrative than central, limiting the depth of the relationship.",
