    "context": "We were not able to monitor these processes in our current setup. Moreover, the effect of the accumulated by-products and possible interactions with each other on the oxidation rate of ethanol should be considered. Simulation results revealed that the total oxidized mass of ethanol vapor was higher than TCE and toluene for identical water saturations, despite a larger oxidation rate constant for TCE than for ethanol and toluene (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014; Waldemer and Tratnyek, 2006). This is due to the fact that TCE and toluene oxidation is more affected by a change in pH of the water phase during their oxidation than ethanol. A rough estimate of the field scale longevity of a permeable reactive layer suggests that horizontal permeable reactive barriers can provide a viable option for preventing VOC vapors from reaching the land surface. However, the performance of such a methodology can be affected by various environmental factors such as pH, soil organic matter, minerals, temperature, soil type, heterogeneity, and particularly the presence of soil water. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) is increasingly applied at contaminated sites to link the concentration decrease of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater to microbial activity [1\u20133], to distinguish biodegradation mechanisms for a variety of common VOCs [4\u20136], or to differentiate several on-site sources of contaminant [7\u20139].

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its oxidation process compared to ethanol and toluene. The oxidation rate constant for TCE is noted to be larger than that for ethanol and toluene, indicating that TCE undergoes oxidation more readily under certain conditions. However, the overall oxidized mass of ethanol vapor is higher than that of TCE and toluene, suggesting that while TCE may oxidize faster, the total amount oxidized is influenced by other factors such as pH and environmental conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and oxidation, as the context provides quantitative comparisons of oxidation rates and discusses the factors affecting these processes, indicating a clear relationship.",
