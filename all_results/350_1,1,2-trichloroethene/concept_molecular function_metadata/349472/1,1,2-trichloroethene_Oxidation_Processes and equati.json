    "context": "Our results suggested that this was due to a decrease in the pH during the TCE experiment, and an increase in the pH during the toluene and ethanol experiments, as expressed by their stoichiometric reaction equations (Eqs. (1) to (3)). In order to model this effect, we allowed for a dependency of kA on pH, according to the following equations: (11) k TCE = \u03ba TCE pH \u2212 \u03c9 TCE \u03b2 TCE (12) \u2202 H + \u2202 t = \u03b6 TCE r TCE oxid in which \u03ba TCE denotes the reaction rate constant in water [N\u22121T\u22121] as determined with batch experiments (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014), \u03c9 TCE and \u03b2 TCE are fitting parameters obtained as part of the simulation results, and H+ denotes the proton concentration [NL-3]. The parameter \u03b6 TCE in Eq.\u00a0(12) is the number of moles of protons produced during oxidation of TCE. According to Eq.\u00a0(1), its value is equal to unity. Similar relationships were employed for the reaction rate coefficients of toluene and ethanol as follows: (13) k A = \u03ba A \u03c9 A \u2212 pH \u03b2 A ; A = toluene , ethanol (14) \u2202 OH \u2212 \u2202 t = \u03b6 A r A oxid where \u03baA denotes the reaction rate constant in water [N\u22121T\u22121] as determined previously (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014), \u03c9A and \u03b2A are fitting parameters, OH- denotes the molar concentration of hydroxide ions, and \u03b6A is the number of moles of hydroxide ions consistent with the stoichiometric reaction (\u03b6toluene =12 and \u03b6ethanol =4)). The above set of coupled equations was solved simultaneously using COMSOL Multiphysics. ",
