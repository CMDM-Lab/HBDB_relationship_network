    "context": "The literature shows that manganese dioxide is increasingly soluble under very acidic conditions (Kao et al., 2008). Therefore, the formation of manganese dioxide precipitates and subsequent coating of the reactive surface of permanganate is not a likely reason for reductions in the TCE oxidation rate. We hence conclude that the reactivity of potassium permanganate during the oxidation of TCE decreased because of the acidic conditions created in the water phase during the TCE column experiments. To control the inhibitory effect of acidity on the reactivity of potassium permanganate during the oxidation of TCE vapor, two separate experiments were performed using two basic salts under the highest water saturation (Sw =0.6). In one experiment, we added sodium bicarbonate to the initial permeable reactive layer. In another experiment, calcium carbonate was employed. Their dissolution in water and the pH buffering capacity were triggered by the proton production due to TCE oxidation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to the reactivity of potassium permanganate during its oxidation. The study highlights that acidic conditions inhibit the oxidation rate of TCE, leading to the use of basic salts like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate as inhibitors to counteract this acidity. Thus, the relationship between TCE and inhibitors is centered on the need to mitigate the inhibitory effects of acidity on TCE oxidation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and inhibitors, as the context discusses the use of basic salts to inhibit the negative effects of acidity on TCE oxidation. This relationship is supported by experimental design aimed at improving TCE reactivity.",
