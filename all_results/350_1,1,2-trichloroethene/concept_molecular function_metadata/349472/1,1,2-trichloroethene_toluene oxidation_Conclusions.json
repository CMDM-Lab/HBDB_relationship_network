    "context": "We were not able to monitor these processes in our current setup. Moreover, the effect of the accumulated by-products and possible interactions with each other on the oxidation rate of ethanol should be considered. Simulation results revealed that the total oxidized mass of ethanol vapor was higher than TCE and toluene for identical water saturations, despite a larger oxidation rate constant for TCE than for ethanol and toluene (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014; Waldemer and Tratnyek, 2006). This is due to the fact that TCE and toluene oxidation is more affected by a change in pH of the water phase during their oxidation than ethanol. A rough estimate of the field scale longevity of a permeable reactive layer suggests that horizontal permeable reactive barriers can provide a viable option for preventing VOC vapors from reaching the land surface. However, the performance of such a methodology can be affected by various environmental factors such as pH, soil organic matter, minerals, temperature, soil type, heterogeneity, and particularly the presence of soil water. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) is increasingly applied at contaminated sites to link the concentration decrease of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater to microbial activity [1\u20133], to distinguish biodegradation mechanisms for a variety of common VOCs [4\u20136], or to differentiate several on-site sources of contaminant [7\u20139].

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene oxidation are discussed in relation to their oxidation rates and the influence of environmental factors such as pH. The simulation results indicate that TCE has a larger oxidation rate constant compared to toluene, but both are similarly affected by changes in pH during their oxidation processes. This suggests a comparative relationship in their oxidation behavior under varying conditions, although specific interactions between TCE and toluene are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are analyzed in terms of their oxidation rates and the impact of environmental factors, indicating a relationship in their behavior during oxidation, but lacking detailed interaction or functional significance.",
