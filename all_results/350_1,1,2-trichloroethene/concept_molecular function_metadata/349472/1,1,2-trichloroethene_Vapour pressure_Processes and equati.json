    "context": "Boundary conditions for Eq. (4) are a constant concentration of the target compound (CA g (t, x=0)=CA0 g) at the lower boundary of the permeable reactive layer and no-flux at the top of the headspace. The simulation further implies continuity fluxes across the interface between the permeable reactive layer and the headspace. The value of C A0 g for TCE and toluene was taken equal to the vapor pressure of the target compounds. However, CA0 g for ethanol was taken to be 80% of its vapor pressure. Initial concentrations of the target compound were equal to zero throughout the domain, i.e., CA g (x, t=0)=0. Several literature studies show that for VOCs with high vapor pressures, vapor diffusion dominates the migration of VOCs through unsaturated soil (Berscheid et al., 2010; Shen et al., 2014; USEPA, 1993).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its vapor pressure, which is used to determine the initial concentration of the compound in a simulation involving vapor diffusion through unsaturated soil. The vapor pressure of TCE is critical for understanding its behavior in environmental conditions, particularly in the context of its migration as a volatile organic compound (VOC). The relationship is significant as it directly influences the modeling of TCE's transport in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and vapor pressure, as the vapor pressure is essential for determining TCE's concentration in the simulation. This relationship is supported by the context's focus on vapor diffusion and its implications for environmental behavior.",
