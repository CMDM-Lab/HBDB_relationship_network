    "context": "Enhanced metabolism of organic pollutants in transgenic plants is associated with a faster uptake, which can be explained by a steeper concentration gradient inside plant tissues. Transgenic plants were also shown to remove volatile compounds from contaminated air at a higher rate than non-transgenic controls: 79% of TCE (none removed by controls), 49% of vinyl chloride (compared with 29% by controls) and \u223c40% of benzene (compared with 13% by controls). All the five compounds under study are listed as Priority Pollutants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (http://oaspub.epa.gov/) and figure in the top 50 of the 2005 Priority List of Hazardous Substances defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/). These compounds are as follows: TCE, the most prevalent soil pollutant found in the United States; vinyl chloride, a dead-end carcinogenic compound produced from TCE biodegradation; carbon tetrachloride, a common toxic solvent also found in many polluted soils; chloroform, a toxic by-product formed during water disinfection by chlorination; and benzene, a carcinogenic compound found in association with petroleum pollution. Conclusions Transgenic poplars (CYP2E1) enhance both the uptake and the metabolism of several toxic solvents and could therefore help to overcome a major limitation inherent to phytoremediation \u2013 namely, the threat that accumulated toxic compounds would volatilize or otherwise contaminate the food chain. Although the study by Doty et al. is not the first report about genetic engineering of plants for phytoremediation applications, it constitutes a milestone in the field for several reasons: first, it is one of the very few studies describing the successful development of transgenic poplars, which is technically challenging; second, the technology is efficient for the treatment of several important organic pollutants likely to be found in mixture in the environment; and third, it constitutes the achievement of a pioneer work initiated by the same group a decade ago. With federal regulations limiting the use of transgenic forest trees, further developments of phytoremediation are likely to involve genetic use restriction technologies (GURTs) for controlling the dispersion of transgenes in the environment.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a prevalent soil pollutant that is removed by transgenic plants, which enhance the uptake and metabolism of various organic pollutants. Chlorination is referenced as a process that produces chloroform, a toxic by-product during water disinfection. However, there is no direct relationship established between TCE and chlorination in terms of their chemical interactions or effects within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to environmental pollution and remediation but lack a detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
