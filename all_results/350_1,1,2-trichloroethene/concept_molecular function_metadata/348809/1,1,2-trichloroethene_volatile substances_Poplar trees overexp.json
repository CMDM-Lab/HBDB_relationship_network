    "context": "Among the different transgenic clones tested, the most efficient one, line 78, expressed CYP2E1 at a 3.7- to 4.6-fold higher level and exhibited the highest level of TCE metabolism (>100-fold higher than in non-transgenic controls). When cultivated in hydroponic solution spiked with toxic compounds, line 78 was capable of extracting \u223c90% of TCE (compared with <3% extracted by non-transgenic controls), 99% of chloroform (compared with 20% by controls) and 92\u201394% of carbon tetrachloride (compared with 20% by controls). Enhanced metabolism of organic pollutants in transgenic plants is associated with a faster uptake, which can be explained by a steeper concentration gradient inside plant tissues. Transgenic plants were also shown to remove volatile compounds from contaminated air at a higher rate than non-transgenic controls: 79% of TCE (none removed by controls), 49% of vinyl chloride (compared with 29% by controls) and \u223c40% of benzene (compared with 13% by controls). All the five compounds under study are listed as Priority Pollutants by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (http://oaspub.epa.gov/) and figure in the top 50 of the 2005 Priority List of Hazardous Substances defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/). These compounds are as follows: TCE, the most prevalent soil pollutant found in the United States; vinyl chloride, a dead-end carcinogenic compound produced from TCE biodegradation; carbon tetrachloride, a common toxic solvent also found in many polluted soils; chloroform, a toxic by-product formed during water disinfection by chlorination; and benzene, a carcinogenic compound found in association with petroleum pollution. Conclusions Transgenic poplars (CYP2E1) enhance both the uptake and the metabolism of several toxic solvents and could therefore help to overcome a major limitation inherent to phytoremediation \u2013 namely, the threat that accumulated toxic compounds would volatilize or otherwise contaminate the food chain.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a volatile organic compound that is effectively metabolized by transgenic plants expressing CYP2E1. The study highlights the ability of these plants to extract and metabolize TCE and other volatile substances from contaminated environments, demonstrating a significant relationship between TCE and the broader category of volatile substances in terms of environmental remediation and pollutant management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between TCE and volatile substances, as the context provides evidence of TCE's metabolism by transgenic plants, indicating a clear relationship in the context of phytoremediation and the removal of hazardous volatile compounds.",
        "score": 4
