    "context": "That study showed that a combination of chemical and molecular techniques could be used effectively to assess natural attenuation in granular aquifers. However, research is needed to determine if these procedures are equally effective in more complex hydrogeological environments, such as fractured shale aquifers. The objective of this investigation is to determine whether TCE can biodegrade under existing conditions in contaminated fractured shale bedrock aquifer at the Oak Ridge Reservation in East Tennessee. A multiple analytical approach involving determination of VOC concentration/distribution, redox conditions, and microbial community structure (using enrichment and molecular techniques) was used to determine if biodegradation of TCE is occurring. This study was conducted in the southeastern portion of Waste Area Grouping 5 (WAG5) on the Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR) in Oak Ridge, TN (Fig. 1) . The reservation is located in the Valley and Ridge geologic province and the study site consists of 0.5 to 2.5 m of saprolite (highly weathered bedrock) on top of interbedded shale and limestone of the Upper Cambrian Age, Dismal Gap Formation. Bedding dips towards the southeast at 30\u201335\u00b0. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its biodegradation in contaminated fractured shale aquifers. However, the term 'Adjudication' is not directly related to TCE or its biodegradation process. Instead, it appears to be a separate concept without any contextual linkage to the chemical processes or environmental assessments being described. Thus, there is no meaningful relationship between TCE and Adjudication in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or connection.",
