    "context": "The intensity was measured as mentioned before, and the average intensity was obtained by integrating the area under the curve and then dividing it by the total time. The average intensity inside the reactor was calculated by a line spectral spherical emission (LSSE) model and a diffused line source model: (1) I ave,\u03bb= \u222b 0 L \u222b 0 2\u03c0 \u222b r1 R rIA,\u03bb dr d\u03b8 dz V , where (2) IA,\u03bb= \u2211 0 L Ii,\u03bb= \u2211 0 L/\u0394z P\u03bb m\u00d74\u00d7\u03c0\u00d7[r2+(z\u2212n\u00d7\u0394z)2] (theLSSEmodel), (3) IA,\u03bb= SL,\u03bb \u03c02 \u222b 0 L r [r2+(z\u2212x)2]3/2 dx(thediffusedlinesourcemodel). The average intensity in the reactor calculated by the two radiation models does not differ significantly and the average intensity in most experiments is \u223c0.003W/cm2 (at 254nm). Due to a very fast degradation rate of TCE, 95% of the light output was blocked by covering the lamp with an aluminum foil and a mesh screen, and the average intensity in the reactor for the TCE experiments was only 1.7\u00d710\u22125 W/cm2 (at 254nm). Two chlorinated alkanes (chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and one chlorinated alkene (trichloroethylene) were selected as model compounds. These compounds were selected due to their widespread occurrence in various waste streams. In addition, due to their low molecular weight and a less complicated molecular structure, a study of these compounds should provide information about the basic pathways for degradation of other VOCs in the same chemical category.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its degradation in a reactor setup, where aluminum foil was used to block light output during experiments. However, there is no direct interaction or chemical relationship established between TCE and aluminum beyond the use of aluminum as a physical barrier in the experimental design. The focus remains on TCE's degradation rather than any specific role of aluminum in its chemical behavior or effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene and aluminum are mentioned together in the context of an experimental setup, but there is no discussion of their interaction or relevance beyond the use of aluminum as a blocking material.",
