    "context": "The average intensity inside the reactor was calculated by a line spectral spherical emission (LSSE) model and a diffused line source model: (1) I ave,\u03bb= \u222b 0 L \u222b 0 2\u03c0 \u222b r1 R rIA,\u03bb dr d\u03b8 dz V , where (2) IA,\u03bb= \u2211 0 L Ii,\u03bb= \u2211 0 L/\u0394z P\u03bb m\u00d74\u00d7\u03c0\u00d7[r2+(z\u2212n\u00d7\u0394z)2] (theLSSEmodel), (3) IA,\u03bb= SL,\u03bb \u03c02 \u222b 0 L r [r2+(z\u2212x)2]3/2 dx(thediffusedlinesourcemodel). The average intensity in the reactor calculated by the two radiation models does not differ significantly and the average intensity in most experiments is \u223c0.003W/cm2 (at 254nm). Due to a very fast degradation rate of TCE, 95% of the light output was blocked by covering the lamp with an aluminum foil and a mesh screen, and the average intensity in the reactor for the TCE experiments was only 1.7\u00d710\u22125 W/cm2 (at 254nm). Two chlorinated alkanes (chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and one chlorinated alkene (trichloroethylene) were selected as model compounds. These compounds were selected due to their widespread occurrence in various waste streams. In addition, due to their low molecular weight and a less complicated molecular structure, a study of these compounds should provide information about the basic pathways for degradation of other VOCs in the same chemical category. Kinetic experiments were conducted by varying the initial concentration of the VOCs, the reaction medium, humidity and the average light intensity in the reactor. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a chlorinated alkene selected for degradation studies alongside other chlorinated compounds. The focus is on understanding the degradation pathways of TCE and similar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the same chemical category. While TCE is classified as an alkene due to its carbon-carbon double bond, the relationship is primarily based on its inclusion in a study of degradation mechanisms rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship with alkenes in general.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is categorized as an alkene and is part of a study aimed at understanding degradation pathways for VOCs, indicating some level of connection but lacking detailed interaction.",
