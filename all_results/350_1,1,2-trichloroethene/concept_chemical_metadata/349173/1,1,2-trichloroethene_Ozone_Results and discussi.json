    "context": "A VOC mass balance and a photon balance indicate that 185nm photons were limiting in almost all experiments in the presence of oxygen and air (Table 5 ). However, at high concentrations of chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, oxygen concentration is only about a magnitude higher, whereas the molar extinction coefficient of oxygen (4.22L/molcm) is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the VOCs. Thus, although there is a strong competition for the 185nm photons between oxygen and the VOCs, the absorption of the 185nm photons at high concentrations of the VOCs still prevails over the absorption by oxygen, unless pure oxygen was used. These results (shown inTables 3 and 4) indicate that the main photodegradation pathways of chloroform and TCE are direct photolysis and Cl initiated/sensitized reactions, and that the oxidation induced by reactive O (1D), ozone or other oxygen species may not be significant. Carbon tetrachloride behaved somewhat differently and the degradation of carbon tetrachloride always followed a first-order kinetic profile in all reaction media and at all initial concentrations. The rate constants of carbon tetrachloride were independent of concentration from 80 to 500ppm and were 0.12min\u22121 in air, 0.060min\u22121 in O2 and 0.051min\u22121 in N2. Experiments of CTC with different ratios of purified nitrogen and oxygen show that the maximum degradation rate was achieved when O2 concentration was 20%, close to the composition of air. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and ozone are discussed in relation to their roles in photodegradation processes. The study indicates that while ozone and other reactive oxygen species may be present, their contribution to the oxidation of TCE is not significant compared to the direct photolysis and Cl-initiated reactions. Thus, the relationship between TCE and ozone is minimal, as ozone does not play a critical role in TCE degradation under the experimental conditions described.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both TCE and ozone are mentioned in the context of photodegradation, but there is no detailed interaction or significant relevance established between them in the degradation process.",
