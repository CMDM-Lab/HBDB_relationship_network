As shown in Fig. 5 , the rate of chloroform and TCE photodegradation increased with moisture in both air and nitrogen, although the increase was much more pronounced in air than in nitrogen, indicating that the reaction between O(1D) and H2O is an important source of hydroxyl radicals. The increase in TCE degradation rate in air in the presence of moisture is slightly lower (a 53% increase at 82% humidity) than that of chloroform (a 76% increase at 71% humidity), possibly due to the lower light intensity used in the TCE experiments. Hydroxyl radicals can react with chloroform and TCE following the reactions shown below: (21) CHCl 3+OH \u2192CCl 3 +H 2 O, (22) C 2 HCl 3+OH .\u2192C 2 Cl 3 +H 2 O, (23) Similar to a Cl radical, an OH radical should be more effective for a more reactive hydrogen atom, and TCE will have more potential for a hydroxyl radical attack than chloroform. In nitrogen, the removal rate of CTC increased (a 31% increase at 41% humidity) with increasing moisture. It is proposed that CTC photodegradation in moist air includes the following reactions: (24) CCl 4+OH \u2192products, (25) CCl 4+H \u2192CCl 3 +HCl. In addition, moisture will absorb photons in competition with CTC and O2, therefore reducing the degradation rate of CTC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes involving hydroxyl radicals, which are reactive species that can interact with various atoms and molecules. However, the term 'Atom' is mentioned in a general sense without specific reference to its role or relationship with TCE. The context primarily focuses on the chemical reactions involving TCE and hydroxyl radicals rather than a direct connection to the concept of an atom.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as TCE is involved in reactions that include atoms (like hydroxyl radicals), but there is no detailed discussion of how TCE specifically relates to the concept of an atom beyond its general chemical interactions.",
