    "context": "Photodegradation of three chlorinated VOCs, two alkanes and one alkene were investigated in this paper. Several important conclusions can be drawn that may be useful for the potential scale-up of the UV photodegradation process. The essential conclusions are summarized below: (i) The presence of a double bond in the structure of the VOCs (i.e., TCE) makes them very reactive and their rate of degradation is very fast, even at a very low light intensity used in the experiments (1.7\u00d710\u22125 W/cm2). (ii) Direct photolysis and Cl sensitized degradation are important for compounds with a reactive hydrogen atom in the structure, such as TCE and chloroform. The degradation of these compounds is more photon efficient at high initial concentrations. (iii) Primary photolysis follows a first order kinetic profile with respect to the concentration of the VOCs, whereas Cl sensitized reactions can be of second-order, as is observed for chloroform degradation at high initial concentrations. (iv) The presence of oxygen in the reaction media competes with the organic compounds for the absorption of 185nm photons. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes, which involve the interaction of its molecular structure with light and reactive species. However, the term 'Atom' is mentioned in a general sense, referring to the fundamental units of matter that make up TCE and other compounds. There is no specific discussion of how TCE interacts with atoms beyond its molecular structure, making the relationship very indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned in the context of its reactivity and degradation, while 'Atom' is a broad term that does not provide specific insights into the chemical behavior or interactions of TCE.",
