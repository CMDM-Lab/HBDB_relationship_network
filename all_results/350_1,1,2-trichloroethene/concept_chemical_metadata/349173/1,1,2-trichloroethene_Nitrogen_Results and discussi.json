    "context": "In addition, water vapor has a continuous UV absorption spectrum between 175 and 190nm and in this wavelength range, a direct decomposition of moisture (Eq. (20)) (although small) is still another source of hydroxyl radicals. (19) O( 1 D)+H 2 O\u21922OH , (20) H 2 O+h\u03bd\u2192H +OH . As shown in Fig. 5 , the rate of chloroform and TCE photodegradation increased with moisture in both air and nitrogen, although the increase was much more pronounced in air than in nitrogen, indicating that the reaction between O(1D) and H2O is an important source of hydroxyl radicals. The increase in TCE degradation rate in air in the presence of moisture is slightly lower (a 53% increase at 82% humidity) than that of chloroform (a 76% increase at 71% humidity), possibly due to the lower light intensity used in the TCE experiments. Hydroxyl radicals can react with chloroform and TCE following the reactions shown below: (21) CHCl 3+OH \u2192CCl 3 +H 2 O, (22) C 2 HCl 3+OH .\u2192C 2 Cl 3 +H 2 O, (23) Similar to a Cl radical, an OH radical should be more effective for a more reactive hydrogen atom, and TCE will have more potential for a hydroxyl radical attack than chloroform. In nitrogen, the removal rate of CTC increased (a 31% increase at 41% humidity) with increasing moisture. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation rates in different environments, specifically in air and nitrogen. The study indicates that moisture enhances the degradation of TCE, with a more pronounced effect observed in air compared to nitrogen. However, the relationship between TCE and nitrogen is primarily about the environmental conditions affecting TCE degradation rather than a direct interaction or chemical relationship between the two substances.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as TCE's degradation is influenced by the presence of nitrogen in the environment, but there is no detailed discussion of a direct relationship or interaction between TCE and nitrogen.",
