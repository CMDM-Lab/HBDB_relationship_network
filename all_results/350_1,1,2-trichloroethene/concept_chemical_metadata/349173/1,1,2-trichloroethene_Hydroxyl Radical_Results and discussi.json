As shown in Fig. 5 , the rate of chloroform and TCE photodegradation increased with moisture in both air and nitrogen, although the increase was much more pronounced in air than in nitrogen, indicating that the reaction between O(1D) and H2O is an important source of hydroxyl radicals. The increase in TCE degradation rate in air in the presence of moisture is slightly lower (a 53% increase at 82% humidity) than that of chloroform (a 76% increase at 71% humidity), possibly due to the lower light intensity used in the TCE experiments. Hydroxyl radicals can react with chloroform and TCE following the reactions shown below: (21) CHCl 3+OH \u2192CCl 3 +H 2 O, (22) C 2 HCl 3+OH .\u2192C 2 Cl 3 +H 2 O, (23) Similar to a Cl radical, an OH radical should be more effective for a more reactive hydrogen atom, and TCE will have more potential for a hydroxyl radical attack than chloroform. In nitrogen, the removal rate of CTC increased (a 31% increase at 41% humidity) with increasing moisture. It is proposed that CTC photodegradation in moist air includes the following reactions: (24) CCl 4+OH \u2192products, (25) CCl 4+H \u2192CCl 3 +HCl. In addition, moisture will absorb photons in competition with CTC and O2, therefore reducing the degradation rate of CTC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation process, which is significantly influenced by the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH). The study highlights that hydroxyl radicals are generated from the reaction of O(1D) with water, and they play a crucial role in the degradation of TCE and chloroform. The increased rate of TCE degradation in moist air indicates a direct interaction where hydroxyl radicals react with TCE, enhancing its breakdown in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and hydroxyl radicals, as the context provides evidence of their interaction in the degradation process. The presence of quantitative data regarding the degradation rates further supports this relationship.",
