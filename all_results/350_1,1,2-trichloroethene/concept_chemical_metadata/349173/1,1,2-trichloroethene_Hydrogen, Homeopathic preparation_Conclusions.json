    "context": "Photodegradation of three chlorinated VOCs, two alkanes and one alkene were investigated in this paper. Several important conclusions can be drawn that may be useful for the potential scale-up of the UV photodegradation process. The essential conclusions are summarized below: (i) The presence of a double bond in the structure of the VOCs (i.e., TCE) makes them very reactive and their rate of degradation is very fast, even at a very low light intensity used in the experiments (1.7\u00d710\u22125 W/cm2). (ii) Direct photolysis and Cl sensitized degradation are important for compounds with a reactive hydrogen atom in the structure, such as TCE and chloroform. The degradation of these compounds is more photon efficient at high initial concentrations. (iii) Primary photolysis follows a first order kinetic profile with respect to the concentration of the VOCs, whereas Cl sensitized reactions can be of second-order, as is observed for chloroform degradation at high initial concentrations. (iv) The presence of oxygen in the reaction media competes with the organic compounds for the absorption of 185nm photons. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes, particularly focusing on its reactivity and degradation kinetics under UV light. However, there is no mention of hydrogen or homeopathic preparations in relation to TCE or its degradation. The terms appear unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and hydrogen, homeopathic preparation. They are mentioned in the same context but do not interact or connect in any significant way.",
