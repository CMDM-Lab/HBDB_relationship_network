As shown in Fig. 5 , the rate of chloroform and TCE photodegradation increased with moisture in both air and nitrogen, although the increase was much more pronounced in air than in nitrogen, indicating that the reaction between O(1D) and H2O is an important source of hydroxyl radicals. The increase in TCE degradation rate in air in the presence of moisture is slightly lower (a 53% increase at 82% humidity) than that of chloroform (a 76% increase at 71% humidity), possibly due to the lower light intensity used in the TCE experiments. Hydroxyl radicals can react with chloroform and TCE following the reactions shown below: (21) CHCl 3+OH \u2192CCl 3 +H 2 O, (22) C 2 HCl 3+OH .\u2192C 2 Cl 3 +H 2 O, (23) Similar to a Cl radical, an OH radical should be more effective for a more reactive hydrogen atom, and TCE will have more potential for a hydroxyl radical attack than chloroform. In nitrogen, the removal rate of CTC increased (a 31% increase at 41% humidity) with increasing moisture. It is proposed that CTC photodegradation in moist air includes the following reactions: (24) CCl 4+OH \u2192products, (25) CCl 4+H \u2192CCl 3 +HCl. In addition, moisture will absorb photons in competition with CTC and O2, therefore reducing the degradation rate of CTC. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in photodegradation reactions where hydroxide ions (OH) play a crucial role as reactive species. The presence of moisture enhances the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which significantly increases the degradation rate of TCE in air. The reactions indicate that hydroxyl radicals can effectively react with TCE, suggesting a direct and significant relationship between TCE and hydroxide ions in the context of environmental degradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between TCE and hydroxide ions, as the context provides evidence of their interaction in photodegradation reactions, highlighting the role of hydroxyl radicals in enhancing TCE degradation rates.",
