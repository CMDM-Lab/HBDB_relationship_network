    "context": "Fig. 2a shows the location of on-site investigations and Fig. 2b shows a schematic representation of the conceptual model for the DNAPL source zone including aquifer heterogeneity. The aquifer is comprised of beach sand deposits with thin, laterally discontinuous silt and clay lenses at several depths. However, one clay layer with a thickness of 5 to 20\u00a0cm occurs continuously throughout the source area at a depth of about 8\u201310\u00a0m below ground surface (bgs) and extends beyond the property boundary in the direction of groundwater flow and plume migration which effectively separates the aquifer into an upper (A) and lower (B) zone. The plume is caused by very thin TCE DNAPL lenses within the sand aquifer, above and below the thin clay beds. Parker et al. (2003) provide more details on the DNAPL distribution (referred to as the Florida site). The plume is suspended in the aquifer, far above the deep aquitard, and horizontal groundwater flow past the DNAPL zone produced a dissolved plume (Fig. 1) which undergoes strong natural attenuation by reductive dechlorination between the industrial facility and U.S. Route 1, a distance of nearly 400\u00a0m.Remediation approach A decision was taken by the site owner, within the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulatory framework, to completely isolate the source zone so that it would no longer contribute contaminants to the plume. Furthermore, it was decided to do this in a manner that would flush the downgradient plume out of the aquifer at the fastest possible rate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant present in a sand aquifer, where its distribution is influenced by the presence of clay layers. The clay acts as a barrier, separating the aquifer into upper and lower zones, which affects the migration and natural attenuation of the TCE plume. However, there is no direct interaction or chemical relationship discussed between TCE and clay beyond their spatial association in the aquifer system.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both TCE and clay are part of the same environmental context, with clay influencing the behavior of TCE in the aquifer. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or specific interactions.",
