    "context": "They discuss the problem of dissolved contaminants invading low permeability strata via diffusion, and subsequent slow rate of release of the contaminants by reverse diffusion during pump-and-treat/aquifer flushing causing long-term tailing. Wilson (1997) used mathematical analysis of idealized conditions to show that back diffusion from low permeability beds within a sand aquifer can cause long-term delay in the time required to meet MCLs in aquifers subjected to pump-and-treat. Following this, the importance of contaminant back diffusion from clayey aquitards on aquifer water quality has been demonstrated through only two field studies with associated mathematical modeling. Ball et al. (1997) and Liu and Ball (2002) used analysis of cores from Dover Air Force Base, where a clayey aquitard underlies a sand aquifer contaminated with PCE and TCE. In this study, a portion of the contaminant plume downgradient of the source area was isolated within a sheet pile cell, and then subjected to pump-and-treat remediation. Subsequent coring and sampling of the aquitard was then conducted to evaluate diffusion processes in the aquitard. Chapman and Parker (2005) provide a case study involving full-scale source-zone isolation at an industrial site. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant in aquifers, while clay is discussed in relation to its role as a low permeability aquitard that can affect the diffusion and release of contaminants. The studies referenced highlight the importance of understanding how clayey layers can influence the behavior of TCE in groundwater systems, particularly in terms of back diffusion and remediation efforts. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the physical properties of clay affecting contaminant behavior rather than a direct chemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses how clay affects the diffusion of TCE in aquifers, indicating a significant connection in terms of environmental impact and remediation strategies, but lacks detailed interaction between the two substances.",
