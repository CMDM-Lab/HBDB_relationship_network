    "context": "The plume, composed of TCE and its degradation products, is \u2018suspended\u2019 in the sand aquifer so that back diffusion from the underlying aquitard is not an issue. This study examines the effects of back diffusion from very thin, low-permeability heterogeneities on the time scale for plume flushing, with interpretations based on detailed field sampling for aquifer heterogeneity and contaminant characterization. Numerical model simulations, using very fine grid discretization and time-step constraints to accurately capture diffusion processes, are used to examine the magnitude of back diffusion from a single thin clay layer with inputs tailored to site conditions, as well as a more general scenario with greater complexity. Site description The site, located in Cocoa, Florida, is a small, operating, metal fabricating and precision cleaning facility at which TCE solvent releases began in the mid- to late 1960s and ended in 1977, causing a plume emanating from a subsurface DNAPL source zone (Fig. 1 ). Parker et al. (2003) studied the contaminant distribution on the industrial property using multilevel groundwater sampling and depth-discrete sampling of continuous cores. Guilbeault et al. (2005) reported on detailed investigations of the plume characteristics based on monitoring along the property fenceline immediately downgradient of the source area. Fig. 2a shows the location of on-site investigations and Fig. 2b shows a schematic representation of the conceptual model for the DNAPL source zone including aquifer heterogeneity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant associated with a metal fabricating facility, where its release has led to a subsurface plume. However, the relationship between TCE and metals is not explicitly discussed, and while metals may be present due to the facility's operations, no direct interaction or impact between TCE and metals is detailed in the study. The focus is primarily on the behavior of TCE in the aquifer rather than its relationship with metals.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both TCE and metals are associated with the same industrial site, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other in the context provided.",
