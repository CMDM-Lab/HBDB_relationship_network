    "context": "Detailed subsampling of cores from several locations in areas of known or suspected DNAPL releases was conducted (Fig. 2a). Cores were collected using the piston-coring technique (described by Zapico et al., 1987 and Starr and Ingleton, 1992) and subsampled at closely spaced vertical intervals (typically 2.5 to 5.0\u00a0cm) with samples preserved in methanol in the field and shipped to a lab for completion of extraction and VOC analyses (described by Parker et al., 2003). Measurement of the fraction of organic carbon (f oc) of the clay layers (method of Churcher and Dichhout, 1987) on representative samples provided a range from 0.22 to 1.54% and geometric mean of 0.57% (N =22). Applying other site-derived values for dry bulk density (\u03c1 b =1.62\u00a0g/cm3) and porosity (\u03d5 =0.40) and a literature-derived organic carbon partitioning coefficient for TCE (K oc =126\u00a0mL/g; Pankow and Cherry, 1996), the TCE retardation factor accounting for sorption, estimated using the well-known relation: R =1+(\u03c1 b / \u03d5) (K oc  f oc), ranges from 2.1 to 8.9 with a mean of 3.9. Fig. 8 shows TCE concentration profiles in the vicinity of clay layers at four locations shown in Fig. 3a. In these graphs, concentrations are expressed as total mass of TCE (combined dissolved and sorbed phase, and DNAPL phase if present) per unit mass of wet soil. Core PM-18, collected next to a groundwater profile where a TCE concentration close to solubility was noted at one depth, was the only location where DNAPL was directly observed via a field screening technique using Sudan IV.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed in relation to its interaction with organic carbon in soil samples. The study measures the fraction of organic carbon (f oc) in clay layers, which is crucial for understanding TCE's sorption behavior and its retardation factor in the environment. While TCE is a specific chemical compound, carbon is a general element that plays a significant role in the sorption processes affecting TCE's mobility in contaminated sites.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between TCE and carbon is discussed in terms of sorption and environmental behavior, indicating their interaction in the context of soil contamination. However, the specifics of their chemical relationship are not deeply explored.",
