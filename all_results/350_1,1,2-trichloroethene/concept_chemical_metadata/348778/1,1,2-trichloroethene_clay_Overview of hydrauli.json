    "context": "It can be expected that much mass also occurs in the clay layers downgradient of the site, where high plume VOC concentrations have occurred for a few decades in this aquifer proximate to these layers. Following declines in groundwater VOC concentrations in the aquifer adjacent to the clay layers as clean water from the re-injection wells flushes through the aquifer, mass stored in the clay layers would be released via back diffusion. A rough calculation of total mass potentially stored in a single clay layer (as dissolved and sorbed phase) between the Fenceline and WR Transects was made to compare with plume mass discharge rates as a means of appreciating the potential for plume tailing. Assuming a total surface area of 4000\u00a0m2 based on a plume width of 100\u00a0m and 40\u00a0m distance between the Fenceline and WR Transects, an average clay layer thickness of 0.2\u00a0m, clay \u03c1 bwet =2.0\u00a0g/cm3 and average C t =50\u00a0\u03bcg TCE/g in the clay layer prior to installation of the capture system (representative of PM-8 located along the Fenceline Transect; Fig. 8b) provides a total TCE mass of 80\u00a0kg in this zone. Assuming the mass discharge has declined by an order of magnitude from the pre-remediation value estimated by Guilbeault et al. (2005) shortly after the plug-flow travel time to the WR Transect, i.e. from 45 to 4.5\u00a0kg/year, and continues to decline but at a slower rate, the potential for longer-term back-diffusion effects even from a single clay layer is obvious. Thus, mass transfer back to the sandy zones is expected to cause measurable concentrations to persist in the aquifer for long time periods, and such effects are examined quantitatively using a numerical model. Model selection and general assumptions The 3-D finite element numerical model HydroGeoSphere (formerly FRAC3DVS, based on the work of Therrien and Sudicky, 1996) was used to examine back-diffusion effects from thin clay layers under conditions tailored to the field site.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its mass storage in clay layers within an aquifer. The clay acts as a medium for the sorption of TCE, which can be released back into the groundwater during remediation efforts. The relationship highlights the role of clay in influencing the behavior and concentration of TCE in the environment, particularly during back-diffusion processes as groundwater conditions change.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and clay, as the context provides quantitative data on TCE mass stored in clay layers and discusses the implications for groundwater remediation. This indicates a clear relationship in the context of environmental chemistry.",
