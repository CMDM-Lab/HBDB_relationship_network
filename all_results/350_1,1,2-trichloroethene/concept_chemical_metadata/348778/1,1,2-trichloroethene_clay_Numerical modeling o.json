    "context": "Overall, this simulation shows that even a single, relatively thin clay layer, can cause contamination to persist at measurable concentrations above MCLs in the adjacent aquifer for many years to decades after complete source removal or isolation. Such persistence should be even greater further downgradient where initiation of back-diffusion effects are delayed, and given the cumulative contribution from back diffusion along the entire plume flowpath downgradient of the removed or isolated source.Multiple clay layers and aquitard scenario Additional aquifer heterogeneity (complexity) can be explored with the HydroGeoSphere (and other) numerical model(s), with the main constraint being computational limitations derived from the need to use very fine grid discretization and time-stepping to avoid numerical dispersion and accurately capture diffusion processes in the low permeability zones. As an illustrative example, a more complex scenario was simulated consisting of an aquifer with several thin, discontinuous clay layers (thicknesses of 0.4 to 0.6\u00a0m) along with an underlying aquitard (Fig. 12 ). Several thin sources (representing DNAPL) were placed on top of clay layers and the underlying aquitard near the upgradient end of the domain, which were held at a constant concentration (TCE solubility) for a period of 30\u00a0years prior to source removal or cutoff and then run for 200\u00a0years after the source was removed. The groundwater velocity in the aquifer was 0.12\u00a0m/day, and travel time through the 200\u00a0m long domain about 4.5\u00a0years. Dispersivities are the same as used previously. Retardation factors were 1.0, 5.0 and 3.0 for the aquifer, clay layers, and aquitard, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed as a contaminant that can persist in groundwater due to the presence of clay layers. The simulation indicates that clay layers can hinder the movement of TCE, allowing it to remain at measurable concentrations in the aquifer for extended periods after source removal. The relationship highlights the role of clay in influencing the transport and degradation of TCE in groundwater systems.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and clay, as the context provides evidence of how clay layers affect the persistence and movement of TCE in groundwater, indicating a clear relationship in environmental chemistry.",
