    "context": "Fig. 5b), which utilizes the wells screened between the clay layers (MNA-1B, 2B, 3B, 4B; Fig. 4b) does not show evidence of inadequate flushing. Sorption may play a role as well, with estimated TCE retardation factors (R) of 1.1 and 1.6 for the upper and lower aquifer zones, respectively (Guilbeault, 1999), but this effect should be minor (i.e. retard the flushing rate by the R factor, assuming linear and reversible sorption) compared to back diffusion from the clay layers. Interestingly, TCE concentrations have declined at a faster rate than its degradation product cis-DCE at MNA-2B, 3B and 4B (TCE has remained below MDLs at MNA-1B), with declines exceeding 99.5% in these wells and TCE below MDLs at two of the wells (MNA-3B, 4B) for the most recent sampling event. Concentrations of VC have remained stable at MNA-3B but have actually increased at MNA-1B, 2B and 4B (Fig. 6b). The declining trend in TCE concentrations along the WR Transect supports cutoff of the plume from the upgradient source zone by the capture system. The possibility of whether the observed tailing can be accounted for by back diffusion of VOC mass out of the clay layers within the plume zone is examined later via model simulations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its concentrations and degradation in aquifer wells, while 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline ethylene dimethylammonium is not mentioned or connected to TCE's behavior or degradation processes. The focus is primarily on TCE's environmental fate, with no direct relationship or interaction with the other compound indicated.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline ethylene dimethylammonium, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
