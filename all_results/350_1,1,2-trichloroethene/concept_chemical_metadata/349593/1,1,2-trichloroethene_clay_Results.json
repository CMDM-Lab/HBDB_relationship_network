    "context": "At this water saturation, both the advective and diffusive fluxes of TCE in the gas phase are non-existent. The only transport mechanism for TCE through the clay layer is diffusive flux in the aqueous phase. Fig.\u00a03d shows contours of the TCE soil gas concentration for scenario 5 at 1800days after emplacement of the TCE source zone. The clay layer has completely prevented TCE from impacting any of the houses despite the fact the vadose zone below the clay layer exhibits considerable TCE soil gas concentrations. Fig.\u00a05 indicates that while the clay layer with no infiltration (scenario 4) does reduce indoor air concentrations, the degree of protection is not nearly as significant as when the clay layer is fully water saturated (scenario 5). For scenario 5, the CompFlow Bio model indicates that all houses should be part of the exclusion zone whereas both J&E and ASTM (2008) provide the exact opposite guidance with the implication that simplification of the stratigraphy is a contribution towards their conservative guidance. The thickness of the vadose zone has a direct impact on the fate and transport of TCE from groundwater to the indoor air given that it alters the offset between the source zone and center of the foundation slab.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport through a clay layer. The clay acts as a barrier, preventing TCE from impacting indoor air quality by limiting its movement primarily to diffusive flux in the aqueous phase. The effectiveness of the clay layer in reducing TCE concentrations is highlighted, particularly when fully water saturated, indicating a significant protective role against TCE contamination in residential areas.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and clay, as the context provides evidence of clay's role in limiting TCE transport and its implications for indoor air quality. The relationship is supported by quantitative observations regarding the effectiveness of the clay layer under different saturation scenarios.",
