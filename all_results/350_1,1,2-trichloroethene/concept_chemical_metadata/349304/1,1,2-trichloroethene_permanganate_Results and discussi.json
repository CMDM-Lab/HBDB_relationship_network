    "context": "In the treatment zone the concentration of TCE remained high throughout the course of the experiment, ranging from 1066 to 1165mg/L, close to the solubility limit of TCE (1280mg/L). This was attributed to (1) incomplete oxidation of the TCE resulting in sufficient TCE remaining in the treatment zone to maintain a dissolved concentration near solubility, and (2) spatial heterogeneities in the contamination spread resulting in untreated zones of TCE. Headspace concentrations of TCE are shown in Fig. 8 . TCE vapours were detected in the headspace in the first sampling event following the permanganate injection, and continued to increase in concentration for the first six weeks of the experiment. After this point, TCE vapour concentrations remained relatively steady (around 300ppm) throughout the remainder of the experiment. The experiment was terminated after 94days, after determining the system was no longer undergoing significant remediation. Based on the results from the control column, it can be inferred that diffusion did not have a significant impact on VOC transport in the ISCO column. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being treated with permanganate in an experiment aimed at remediation. The high concentrations of TCE indicate incomplete oxidation, suggesting that permanganate's role as an oxidizing agent is critical in the treatment process. However, the results show that TCE vapors persisted even after permanganate injection, indicating that the oxidation process was not fully effective, and TCE remained in the treatment zone throughout the experiment.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the relationship between TCE and permanganate is discussed in terms of their interaction in the oxidation process. However, the incomplete oxidation indicates that while they are related, the effectiveness of their interaction is limited.",
