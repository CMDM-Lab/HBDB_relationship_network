    "context": "In-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) of VOCs has been well developed as a remediation technology of dissolved VOCs in groundwater (Heiderscheidt et al., 2008; Li and Schwartz, 2004; Tsitonaki et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2013). However, only a few studies have applied ISCO to the unsaturated zone using permanganate (Hesemann and Hildebrandt, 2009) or other oxidants (Cronk et al., 2010). In these studies, the oxidant was mostly introduced as an aqueous solution, thus effectively saturating the unsaturated zone. By contrast, our recent study showed that dry solid potassium permanganate granules were able to oxidize TCE, toluene, and ethanol (target compound) vapors, according to the following overall reaction equations (Mahmoodlu et al., 2013): (1) C 2 HCl 3 g + 2 KMnO 4 s \u2192 2 K + + 2 MnO 2 s + 3 Cl \u2212 + 2 CO 2 g + H + (2) C 6 H 5 CH 3 g + 12 KMnO 4 s + 2 H 2 O \u2192 12 K + + 12 OH \u2212 + 12 MnO 2 s + 7 CO 2 g (3) C 2 H 5 OH g + 4 KMnO 4 s \u2192 4 K + + 4 OH \u2212 + 4 MnO 2 s + 2 CO 2 g + H 2 O . VOC vapor oxidation presented in our earlier study occurred through the exposure of VOC vapor to excess amounts of solid potassium permanganate. As a result, any potential long-term effects on the reactivity of potassium permanganate through the accumulation of reaction products, such as manganese dioxide (MnO2) and pH changes, could not be assessed. Also, the experiments were performed at low moisture conditions with only ambient air providing initial humidity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a chemical oxidation process using potassium permanganate, which generates hydroxide ions (OH\u2212) as a byproduct. The oxidation reactions indicate that TCE is being transformed into other products, with hydroxide ions being produced in the process. This suggests a direct chemical relationship where the oxidation of TCE contributes to the formation of hydroxide ions, highlighting their interconnected roles in the remediation of VOCs in groundwater.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and hydroxide ions, as the oxidation of TCE directly results in the production of hydroxide ions during the chemical reactions described. This relationship is supported by the reaction equations provided in the context.",
