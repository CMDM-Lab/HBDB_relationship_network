    "context": "To control the inhibitory effect of acidity on the reactivity of potassium permanganate during the oxidation of TCE vapor, two separate experiments were performed using two basic salts under the highest water saturation (Sw =0.6). In one experiment, we added sodium bicarbonate to the initial permeable reactive layer. In another experiment, calcium carbonate was employed. Their dissolution in water and the pH buffering capacity were triggered by the proton production due to TCE oxidation. In line with the hypothesis that pH exerted the main control on the oxidation rates, the results suggest that the addition of both carbonates positively affected the reactivity of the permeable reactive layer in the TCE oxidation experiments (Fig.\u00a04 ). However, the overall effect was still relatively small. The effect of the accumulated by-products on the reactivity of the permeable reactive layer should be reduced by adding water. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in oxidation reactions where protons are produced as by-products. The acidity from proton production affects the reactivity of potassium permanganate during TCE oxidation. The addition of basic salts like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate helps buffer the pH, thereby influencing the oxidation rates of TCE. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE oxidation and proton generation, highlighting the importance of pH control in the reaction process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and protons, as the context discusses how proton production from TCE oxidation impacts the reactivity of the system. The buffering effect of added carbonates further emphasizes the relevance of protons in controlling the reaction.",
