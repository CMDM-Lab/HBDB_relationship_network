    "context": "A series of control experiments with 30g sand, no potassium permanganate, and identical water saturations was carried out for all target compounds. All experiments were conducted in a fume cabinet at room temperature (22\u00b11\u00b0C) in duplicate. We assumed that the temperature and pressure inside the columns remained constant and were equal to room temperature and atmospheric pressure, respectively. Two separate additional experiments were conducted for TCE, in which 1.0g of dry basic salts was added to the permeable reactive layer, in order to buffer proton production. For one experiment, we used sodium bicarbonate and in the other experiment calcium carbonate. For the TCE experiments, we further tested the effect of adding water during the experiments on the reactivity of the permeable reactive layer. The water was added to the permeable reactive layer in two different ways. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in experiments assessing the effects of buffering agents on proton production during its treatment. The addition of sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate aims to buffer protons generated in the reactive layer, indicating a relationship where the buffering capacity influences the reactivity of TCE in the experimental setup. However, the specific interactions between TCE and protons are not elaborated upon beyond this buffering context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the role of protons in the treatment of TCE, particularly in relation to buffering agents. While there is a connection, the details of their interaction are not extensively explored.",
