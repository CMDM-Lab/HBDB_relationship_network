    "context": "Since we used an excess amount of potassium permanganate, the consumption of potassium permanganate due to oxidizing VOCs was disregarded. We hence equated the maximum concentration of permanganate in water equal to the solubility of potassium permanganate,  C Mn O 4 \u2212 , max w . Preliminary analysis of the experimental results showed that oxidation rate ceased after a certain period of time. Our results suggested that this was due to a decrease in the pH during the TCE experiment, and an increase in the pH during the toluene and ethanol experiments, as expressed by their stoichiometric reaction equations (Eqs. (1) to (3)). In order to model this effect, we allowed for a dependency of kA on pH, according to the following equations: (11) k TCE = \u03ba TCE pH \u2212 \u03c9 TCE \u03b2 TCE (12) \u2202 H + \u2202 t = \u03b6 TCE r TCE oxid in which \u03ba TCE denotes the reaction rate constant in water [N\u22121T\u22121] as determined with batch experiments (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014), \u03c9 TCE and \u03b2 TCE are fitting parameters obtained as part of the simulation results, and H+ denotes the proton concentration [NL-3]. The parameter \u03b6 TCE in Eq.\u00a0(12) is the number of moles of protons produced during oxidation of TCE. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are discussed in relation to their oxidation reactions with potassium permanganate. The study indicates that the pH levels during the experiments influenced the oxidation rates of TCE and toluene differently. While both compounds are involved in the same experimental setup, their specific interactions or comparative effects are not elaborated upon, indicating a more general relationship based on their chemical behavior in the presence of an oxidizing agent.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene are mentioned together in the context of oxidation reactions, but their relationship is not deeply explored beyond their involvement in the same experimental conditions.",
        "score": 2
