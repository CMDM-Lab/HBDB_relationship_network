    "context": "Since monitoring of the pH in the water phase was not possible during our experiments, the pH values were estimated based on stoichiometric reactions. Our calculations for the TCE oxidation experiments showed that the pH could have decreased to about 1.25. The literature shows that manganese dioxide is increasingly soluble under very acidic conditions (Kao et al., 2008). Therefore, the formation of manganese dioxide precipitates and subsequent coating of the reactive surface of permanganate is not a likely reason for reductions in the TCE oxidation rate. We hence conclude that the reactivity of potassium permanganate during the oxidation of TCE decreased because of the acidic conditions created in the water phase during the TCE column experiments. To control the inhibitory effect of acidity on the reactivity of potassium permanganate during the oxidation of TCE vapor, two separate experiments were performed using two basic salts under the highest water saturation (Sw =0.6). In one experiment, we added sodium bicarbonate to the initial permeable reactive layer. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being oxidized using potassium permanganate, with the study investigating how acidic conditions affect the reactivity of permanganate during this process. The findings suggest that the acidic environment decreases the oxidation rate of TCE by permanganate, indicating a significant interaction between the two substances in the context of chemical reactivity and environmental remediation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and permanganate, as the study provides evidence that acidic conditions impact the reactivity of permanganate in TCE oxidation. This relationship is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of permanganate in environmental applications.",
        "score": 4
