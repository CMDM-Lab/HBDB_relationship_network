    "context": "This would require simulating additional processes, such as the evaporation of ethanol from the liquid pool, evaporation of water from the permeable reactive layer and its partitioning into the ethanol pool, and estimating the equilibrium vapor concentration of the air phase below the permeable layer. We were not able to monitor these processes in our current setup. Moreover, the effect of the accumulated by-products and possible interactions with each other on the oxidation rate of ethanol should be considered. Simulation results revealed that the total oxidized mass of ethanol vapor was higher than TCE and toluene for identical water saturations, despite a larger oxidation rate constant for TCE than for ethanol and toluene (Mahmoodlu et al., 2014; Waldemer and Tratnyek, 2006). This is due to the fact that TCE and toluene oxidation is more affected by a change in pH of the water phase during their oxidation than ethanol. A rough estimate of the field scale longevity of a permeable reactive layer suggests that horizontal permeable reactive barriers can provide a viable option for preventing VOC vapors from reaching the land surface. However, the performance of such a methodology can be affected by various environmental factors such as pH, soil organic matter, minerals, temperature, soil type, heterogeneity, and particularly the presence of soil water.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are discussed in relation to their oxidation rates and the influence of environmental factors such as pH on their degradation. The simulation results indicate that while TCE has a larger oxidation rate constant compared to ethanol and toluene, the oxidation of both TCE and toluene is significantly affected by changes in pH during their oxidation processes. This suggests a comparative relationship in their behavior under similar conditions, particularly in the context of environmental remediation.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are analyzed for their oxidation rates and the impact of pH, indicating a shared significance in the context of environmental processes. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond their comparative oxidation characteristics.",
