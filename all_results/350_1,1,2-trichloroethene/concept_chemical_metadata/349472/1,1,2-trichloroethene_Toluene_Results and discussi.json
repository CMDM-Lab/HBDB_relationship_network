    "context": "Assuming that VOC vapors are transported to the reactive layer by diffusion only, the continuous mass fluxes reaching the permeable reactive layer could be calculated. Then, using the correlation equation (i.e., Eq.\u00a0(16)), we calculated the lifetime of the permeable reactive barrier. All parameter values and results are given in Table\u00a02 . Calculations showed that the permeable reactive layer would be able to oxidize TCE, toluene, and ethanol vapors for a period of 247, 227 and 785days, respectively. Obviously, the longevity of a horizontal permeable reactive barrier is affected by many environmental factors. Nevertheless, this rough estimate of the longevity shows that horizontal permeable reactive barrier could be a viable option for preventing VOC vapors from reaching indoor space. In fact, these estimates are based on experimental results that suffered from water limitations in a sealed column. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be oxidized by a permeable reactive barrier. The study provides estimates of the longevity of this barrier in oxidizing TCE and toluene vapors, indicating a shared relevance in the context of environmental remediation. However, the relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same treatment scenario without detailed interaction or comparison between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are discussed in the context of their oxidation by a permeable reactive barrier, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship detailed between them beyond their shared classification as VOCs.",
        "score": 2
