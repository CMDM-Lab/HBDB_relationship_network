    "context": "In-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) of VOCs has been well developed as a remediation technology of dissolved VOCs in groundwater (Heiderscheidt et al., 2008; Li and Schwartz, 2004; Tsitonaki et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2013). However, only a few studies have applied ISCO to the unsaturated zone using permanganate (Hesemann and Hildebrandt, 2009) or other oxidants (Cronk et al., 2010). In these studies, the oxidant was mostly introduced as an aqueous solution, thus effectively saturating the unsaturated zone. By contrast, our recent study showed that dry solid potassium permanganate granules were able to oxidize TCE, toluene, and ethanol (target compound) vapors, according to the following overall reaction equations (Mahmoodlu et al., 2013): (1) C 2 HCl 3 g + 2 KMnO 4 s \u2192 2 K + + 2 MnO 2 s + 3 Cl \u2212 + 2 CO 2 g + H + (2) C 6 H 5 CH 3 g + 12 KMnO 4 s + 2 H 2 O \u2192 12 K + + 12 OH \u2212 + 12 MnO 2 s + 7 CO 2 g (3) C 2 H 5 OH g + 4 KMnO 4 s \u2192 4 K + + 4 OH \u2212 + 4 MnO 2 s + 2 CO 2 g + H 2 O . VOC vapor oxidation presented in our earlier study occurred through the exposure of VOC vapor to excess amounts of solid potassium permanganate. As a result, any potential long-term effects on the reactivity of potassium permanganate through the accumulation of reaction products, such as manganese dioxide (MnO2) and pH changes, could not be assessed. Also, the experiments were performed at low moisture conditions with only ambient air providing initial humidity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be oxidized using potassium permanganate in a remediation process. The study highlights their chemical reactions with the oxidant, indicating that both compounds are targeted for degradation in groundwater remediation efforts. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their simultaneous treatment rather than a direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are discussed in the context of their oxidation reactions with potassium permanganate. They are part of the same remediation process, but the context does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative significance.",
