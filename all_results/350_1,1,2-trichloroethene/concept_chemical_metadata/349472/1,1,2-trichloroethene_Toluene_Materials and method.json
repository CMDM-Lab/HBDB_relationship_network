    "context": "Also, the experiments were performed at low moisture conditions with only ambient air providing initial humidity. While the study confirmed the potential of using permanganate for permeable reactive barriers in the unsaturated zone, it remained unclear how water content and chemical evolution would affect the reactivity of a permeable reactive barrier. In this study we therefore performed a series of column experiments to (1) evaluate the ability of solid potassium permanganate as a horizontal permeable reactive layer to oxidize the vapor of three VOCs under various degrees of water saturation, (2) investigate the impact of the accumulations of by-products on the long-term reactivity of potassium permanganate, and (3) numerically simulate the migration and oxidation process of each target compound diffusing through the permeable reactive layer. Materials The contaminants (target compounds) used in this study were pure TCE, toluene, and ethanol (from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, and ACROS, respectively). Solid potassium permanganate of 99% purity was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and well mixed with sand to create a permeable reactive layer. The sand used in this study originated from a river bed in Papendrecht (Filcom Company, The Netherlands) and was sieved to retain sizes of 0.5\u20131mm. The porosity of sand was estimated to be approximately 0.35. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as target volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a study evaluating the reactivity of potassium permanganate in permeable reactive barriers. However, the relationship between TCE and toluene is not explicitly discussed, and they are treated as separate contaminants undergoing similar experimental conditions without direct interaction or comparison between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are included in the same study regarding their oxidation by potassium permanganate, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their classification as VOCs.",
