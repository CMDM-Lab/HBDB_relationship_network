    "context": "This study assumed that Nitrosomonas-related bacteria intermittently participate in the degradation of TCE and VC because cis-DCE and VC were not consistently detected. Curvibacter which is a TCE-degrading bacteria (Kuo et al., 2014) showed a high relative abundance (>5%) at well WS-4, which contained high concentrations of cis-DCE and low levels of VC, accounting for 23.1% of all sequences (Fig. 7). It has been suggested that this species is potentially involved in the degradation of TCE and VC. Methanotrophs such as Methylotenera and Methylobacter, which utilize methane as the sole source of carbon and energy, participate in cometabolic TCE degradation (Koh et al., 1993; van Hylckama and Janssen, 2001; Kotik et al., 2013). The genus Methylobacter appears to be significant members of the bacterial groundwater communities of Group B, which consisted of wells installed near the stream, accounting for 10.3% of all sequences (Fig. 7). Especially, the species M. tundripaludum, which is a methane-oxidizing bacterium showed high relative abundance (6.2% of all sequence) at well WS-4, which contained a high concentration of cis-DCE (32\u03bcg/L) and low levels of TCE (1 to 2\u03bcg/L) and VC (1 to12 \u03bcg/L) under anaerobic conditions (Table 1). It is likely that the high abundance of methylotrophs under anaerobic conditions near the stream is a consequence of the metabolic activity of archeal methanogens, thereby generating methane, and a carbon and energy source for methylotrophic bacteria mentioned by Kotik et al. (2013). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by specific bacteria, including methanotrophs that utilize methane as a carbon source. The presence of carbon, specifically in the form of methane, is crucial for the metabolic processes of these bacteria, which are involved in the cometabolic degradation of TCE. Thus, carbon serves as an essential energy source for the microbial communities that facilitate the breakdown of TCE in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon, as the context highlights the role of carbon (in the form of methane) in supporting the metabolic activity of bacteria that degrade TCE. This relationship is backed by evidence of bacterial involvement in TCE degradation.",
