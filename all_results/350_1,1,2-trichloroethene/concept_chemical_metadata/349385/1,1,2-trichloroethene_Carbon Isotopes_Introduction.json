    "context": "The CSIA method uses differences in the reaction rates between molecules with light and heavy isotopes, and evaluates the amount of heavy isotope enrichment in the remaining substrate. Use of both CSIA and nucleotide sequence analysis can thus provide guidelines for microbial ecology, and can be used to indicate the trend of biological processes (Marley et al., 1992; Chen et al., 2005). Previous studies relating to isotope analysis have been performed at the present study site, but they have been focused on source identification and allocation (Kaown et al., 2014a). However, in this study compound-specific carbon isotope ratio data for TCE and its daughter product (cis-DCE) are used to find evidence for biodegradation in the upgradient and downgradient areas of the study site. This study focuses particularly on the stream zone at the border of the contaminant plume, where degradation reactions are able to control the evolution of the plume, as observed by Wilson et al. (2004). Each microbial community has different characteristics and is formed through the interaction between other microorganisms according to the surrounding environment (Watson et al., 2008). For this reason, it is more important to gain an understanding of microbial communities rather than each type of microorganism. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using compound-specific carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) to investigate biodegradation processes. The study employs carbon isotope ratios to differentiate between TCE and its degradation products, indicating the role of microbial communities in the degradation of contaminants. However, the relationship between TCE and carbon isotopes is primarily methodological, focusing on isotope analysis rather than a direct interaction between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is analyzed through carbon isotopes to study biodegradation, indicating a significant methodological connection. However, there is no detailed discussion of their direct interaction beyond the analytical approach.",
        "score": 3
