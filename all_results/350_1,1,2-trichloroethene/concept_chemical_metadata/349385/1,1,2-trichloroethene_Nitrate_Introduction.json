    "context": "Simulations of VOC transport in undisturbed water using a moving boundary value model that accounted for fluid withdrawal showed a significant discrepancy between experimental data and simulation results when know values for the VOC molecular diffusion coefficients (D w ) were used. An artificial increase in the VOC molecular diffusion (3\u00d7 D w ) could satisfactorily simulate the experimental data, presumably because of some convection in the water reservoir caused by the sampling process Industrial solvent trichloroethylene (TCE) is among the most common chlorinated compounds found in groundwater contamination. In Korea, TCE and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) are the main components of the DNAPLs (dense non-aqueous phase liquids) found in the groundwater of industrial areas, and groundwater contaminated by DNAPLs is often associated with nitrate contamination (KMOE, 2010). Because chlorinated solvents have relatively high solubility in water and a low tendency to sorb, long contaminant plumes form and may reach surface water bodies. In the study area, a TCE plume originating from an upgradient source zone in an industrial complex passes through local sources in a downgradient area, and is discharged to a stream. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an intensive study to evaluate the effect of contaminant plumes on stream water quality. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a common chlorinated solvent found in groundwater contamination, which is often associated with nitrate contamination. The presence of TCE in groundwater can lead to the formation of long contaminant plumes that may affect water quality, including nitrate levels. However, the specific interaction between TCE and nitrate is not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between TCE and nitrate, as both are mentioned in the context of groundwater contamination. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or evidence of direct interaction, making it a general association rather than a significant connection.",
