    "context": "Therefore, it was assumed that dehalogenators were detected in small numbers in the downgradient area because the fluctuating redox conditions are not suitable for anaerobic organohalide-respiring bacteria. However, some of the more versatile genera or organohalide respirers, which use various electron acceptors and donors (Maphosa et al., 2010), were detected, albeit in small numbers. For instance, the genus Geobacter, which is one of the most important dechlorinating bacteria involved in the process of TCE to cis-DCE and acts as a metal-reducing bacterium (Sung et al., 2006), was relatively abundant at well GW-19 under anaerobic conditions, accounting for 1.9% of all sequences (Fig. 7). The presence of the genus Geobacter correlated with the detection of cis-DCE and VC at well GW-19, and correlated with a larger shift in the carbon isotope composition of both TCE and cis-DCE. In addition, molar fractions for TCE, cis-DCE, and VC (0.2%, 96.8%, and 2.9%) at this well provide supporting evidence that the genus Geobacter was actively reductive dechlorinating TCE to cis-DCE. Nitrosomonas-related bacteria, which are capable of cometabolically degrading a variety of halogenated organic compounds, including TCE, benzene, and VC (Arciero et al., 1989) were the most abundant at well WS-7 and accounted for 8.7% of all sequences. The presence of Nitrosomonas-related bacteria correlated with the detection of low levels of VC (1\u201311\u03bcg/L) at well WS-7 compared to well WS-2 (1\u201356\u03bcg/L) (Table 1). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by the genus Geobacter, which is involved in the reductive dechlorination process. The study notes a correlation between the presence of Geobacter and shifts in the carbon isotope composition of TCE and its degradation products, indicating that carbon isotopes can serve as indicators of microbial activity and the transformation of TCE in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon isotopes, as the context provides evidence of their relationship through the correlation of microbial activity with changes in carbon isotope composition, indicating a clear interaction in the bioremediation process.",
