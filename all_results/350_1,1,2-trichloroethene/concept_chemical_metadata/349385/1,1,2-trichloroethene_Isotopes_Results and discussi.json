    "context": "The enrichment of \u03b413CTCE values accompanied by declining TCE molar fraction was observed; this is a typical trend for TCE biodegradation. In the study area, the most-enriched \u03b413CTCE values (\u221217.7\u2030) compared to the source values were found in the groundwater sampled from WS-3 well, which is located in the vicinity of the stream (Fig. 4a). This isotope pattern is in agreement with the VOC molar distribution, which showed that cis-DCE represented 96.8% of the remaining total VOCs in this well, thereby indicating that an appreciable mass of TCE had been transformed to cis-DCE (Table 2, Fig. 2). In the downgradient area (and in particular around the stream), where much lower TCE concentration were observed than in the source area, relatively higher byproducts of TCE such as cis-DCE and VC were detected. At wells WS-2 and WS-3, which are located around the stream, the cis-DCE comprised more than 86% of the total VOCs, and VC represented 5% of this amount (Table 2, Fig. 2); these data also support the conclusion that TCE was biodegraded to cis-DCE and VC in the downgradient area. The \u03b413C values for cis-DCE at these wells were depleted compared to values at the main source area, which was consistent with the expectation that cis-DCE was formed by the degradation of TCE (Fig. 4b).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed through the lens of isotopic enrichment, specifically \u03b413CTCE values, to track its biodegradation in groundwater. The study observes a correlation between declining TCE concentrations and increasing \u03b413CTCE values, indicating that isotopic analysis can provide insights into the transformation of TCE into its byproducts, such as cis-DCE and VC, during biodegradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and isotopes, as the isotopic analysis is used to understand the biodegradation process of TCE. The context provides evidence of how isotopic patterns correlate with TCE transformation, indicating a clear relationship.",
