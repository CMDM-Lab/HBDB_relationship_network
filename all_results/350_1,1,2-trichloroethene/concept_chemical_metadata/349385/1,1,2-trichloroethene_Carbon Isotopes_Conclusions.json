    "context": "Although the investigated microbial groundwater communities were highly complex, some dominant genus and species (i.e. Polaromonas-related bacteria; Geobacter; Nitrosomonas-related bacteria; Curvibacter; Methanotrophs such as Methylotenera and Methylobacter) were detected, and these dechlorinating bacteria may have contributed to the aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes (i.e. reductive dechlorination, and metabolic and cometabolic oxidation). The detected location of putative reductive dechlorinating bacteria around the stream correlated with the detected position of cis-DCE and VC, as well as with the position of a larger shift in the carbon isotope composition of both TCE and cis-DCE. This reductive dechlorination to VC was also investigated at locations where iron-, manganese-, and nitrate-reducing processes were observed. In addition, phylogenetic groups of microbial communities were found to be closely related to the direction of local groundwater flow around the stream. Although 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing was only used in this study to demonstrate the presence of a gene, not the activity of a process, there was good agreement between the detection of microbial communities and the location appeared to be under anaerobically degradable conditions.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is linked to carbon isotopes through the study of microbial groundwater communities that facilitate the biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes. The research indicates a correlation between the presence of dechlorinating bacteria and shifts in the carbon isotope composition of TCE and its degradation products, suggesting that microbial activity influences the isotopic signature of these compounds during reductive dechlorination processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon isotopes, as the study provides evidence of how microbial degradation processes affect the carbon isotope composition of TCE, indicating a clear relationship within the context of bioremediation.",
