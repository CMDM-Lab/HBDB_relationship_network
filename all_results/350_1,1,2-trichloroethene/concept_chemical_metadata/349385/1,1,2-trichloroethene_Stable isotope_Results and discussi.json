    "context": "These results meant that the strong oxidants O2 and NO3 \u2212 have not been fully consumed as electron acceptors in the upgradient area. Furthermore, anaerobic condition with high concentrations of Fe2+ and Mn2+ and low concentrations of DO and NO3 \u2212 was found in the streamside zone of the downgradient area, within which the TCE molar fraction accounted for 0.2 to 8.2% of the total VOCs found around the stream, as presented in Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3. The change of geochemical parameters in the downgradient area indicates that TCE started to serve as electron acceptor following consumption of the oxidants O2 and NO3 \u2212. The trend of the redox condition and the distribution of the VOC's molar fraction from the main source zone to the stream indicated that reductive dechlorination was occurring in the downgradient area, especially around the stream.Compound-specific carbon stable isotope analysis The measured \u03b413C values of TCE and cis-DCE are shown in Table 2. Most of the measured \u03b413C values of TCE ranged from \u221224.7\u2030 to \u221217.7\u2030 (mean value, \u221222.4\u2030). The observed \u03b413C of cis-DCE values ranged from \u221229.1\u2030 to \u221223.8\u2030 (mean value, \u221227.1\u2030). It was apparent that the values of \u03b413C were affected by whether or not degradation of TCE had occurred, and it appeared that generally the \u03b413C values of TCE were depleted in the upgradient area (Fig. 4a). The SKW-6 well in the main source zone showed the highest concentrations of dissolved TCE (2018\u03bcg/L), and the least-enriched \u03b413C signatures were found at this site (Table 2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using compound-specific carbon stable isotope analysis to assess its degradation in a downgradient area. The \u03b413C values of TCE are measured to determine the extent of reductive dechlorination, indicating that the isotopic composition can reflect the degradation processes of TCE in the environment. The relationship is significant as the stable isotope analysis provides insights into the biogeochemical behavior of TCE.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between TCE and stable isotopes, as the \u03b413C values are used to infer degradation processes, supported by quantitative data on isotopic signatures. This indicates a clear relationship within the context of environmental chemistry.",
