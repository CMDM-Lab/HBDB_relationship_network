    "context": "For instance, the genus Geobacter, which is one of the most important dechlorinating bacteria involved in the process of TCE to cis-DCE and acts as a metal-reducing bacterium (Sung et al., 2006), was relatively abundant at well GW-19 under anaerobic conditions, accounting for 1.9% of all sequences (Fig. 7). The presence of the genus Geobacter correlated with the detection of cis-DCE and VC at well GW-19, and correlated with a larger shift in the carbon isotope composition of both TCE and cis-DCE. In addition, molar fractions for TCE, cis-DCE, and VC (0.2%, 96.8%, and 2.9%) at this well provide supporting evidence that the genus Geobacter was actively reductive dechlorinating TCE to cis-DCE. Nitrosomonas-related bacteria, which are capable of cometabolically degrading a variety of halogenated organic compounds, including TCE, benzene, and VC (Arciero et al., 1989) were the most abundant at well WS-7 and accounted for 8.7% of all sequences. The presence of Nitrosomonas-related bacteria correlated with the detection of low levels of VC (1\u201311\u03bcg/L) at well WS-7 compared to well WS-2 (1\u201356\u03bcg/L) (Table 1). This study assumed that Nitrosomonas-related bacteria intermittently participate in the degradation of TCE and VC because cis-DCE and VC were not consistently detected. Curvibacter which is a TCE-degrading bacteria (Kuo et al., 2014) showed a high relative abundance (>5%) at well WS-4, which contained high concentrations of cis-DCE and low levels of VC, accounting for 23.1% of all sequences (Fig. 7).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as an organic chemical that is subject to biodegradation by specific bacteria, such as Geobacter and Nitrosomonas. These bacteria are involved in the reductive dechlorination process, converting TCE into less harmful compounds like cis-DCE and VC. The study highlights the role of these organic chemicals in environmental bioremediation, emphasizing their significance in microbial degradation pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and organic chemicals, as TCE is explicitly mentioned as a target for microbial degradation by specific bacteria. The context provides evidence of the biochemical interactions and transformations involving TCE, underscoring its relevance in environmental chemistry.",
