    "context": "This study assumed that Nitrosomonas-related bacteria intermittently participate in the degradation of TCE and VC because cis-DCE and VC were not consistently detected. Curvibacter which is a TCE-degrading bacteria (Kuo et al., 2014) showed a high relative abundance (>5%) at well WS-4, which contained high concentrations of cis-DCE and low levels of VC, accounting for 23.1% of all sequences (Fig. 7). It has been suggested that this species is potentially involved in the degradation of TCE and VC. Methanotrophs such as Methylotenera and Methylobacter, which utilize methane as the sole source of carbon and energy, participate in cometabolic TCE degradation (Koh et al., 1993; van Hylckama and Janssen, 2001; Kotik et al., 2013). The genus Methylobacter appears to be significant members of the bacterial groundwater communities of Group B, which consisted of wells installed near the stream, accounting for 10.3% of all sequences (Fig. 7). Especially, the species M. tundripaludum, which is a methane-oxidizing bacterium showed high relative abundance (6.2% of all sequence) at well WS-4, which contained a high concentration of cis-DCE (32\u03bcg/L) and low levels of TCE (1 to 2\u03bcg/L) and VC (1 to12 \u03bcg/L) under anaerobic conditions (Table 1). It is likely that the high abundance of methylotrophs under anaerobic conditions near the stream is a consequence of the metabolic activity of archeal methanogens, thereby generating methane, and a carbon and energy source for methylotrophic bacteria mentioned by Kotik et al. (2013). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and methane are related through the metabolic activities of specific bacteria. Methanotrophs, which utilize methane as their carbon and energy source, are involved in the cometabolic degradation of TCE. The presence of methanotrophic bacteria, such as Methylotenera and Methylobacter, suggests a synergistic relationship where methane production by methanogens supports the degradation of TCE by these bacteria, particularly under anaerobic conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and methane, as the context discusses the role of methanotrophs in TCE degradation, indicating a clear interaction between the two in the metabolic processes of specific bacterial communities.",
        "score": 4
