    "context": "This reductive dechlorination to VC was also investigated at locations where iron-, manganese-, and nitrate-reducing processes were observed. In addition, phylogenetic groups of microbial communities were found to be closely related to the direction of local groundwater flow around the stream. Although 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing was only used in this study to demonstrate the presence of a gene, not the activity of a process, there was good agreement between the detection of microbial communities and the location appeared to be under anaerobically degradable conditions. The multilateral approach implicit in hydrogeochemical and biomolecular methods in relation to compound-specific isotope analysis indicated that the TCE plumes were naturally attenuated by active aerobic and anaerobic dechlorination of TCE to VC around the stream. As a result, the TCE plumes dispersed near the stream, and had no appreciable effects on the streamwater quality. The polyphasic approach used in this study was considered useful in evaluating the development and degradation of the contaminant plume, as well as in investigating the effect of contaminated groundwater on surrounding surface water bodies. A number of remediation techniques (e.g., soil vapor extraction and bioventing) are currently available for treating an unsaturated zone contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Stroo and Ward, 2010).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation processes, particularly through reductive dechlorination to vinyl chloride (VC). The mention of isotopes pertains to compound-specific isotope analysis, which is used to evaluate the degradation of TCE and its environmental impact. However, the relationship between TCE and isotopes is indirect, as isotopes are a method of analysis rather than a direct interaction with TCE itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the study of TCE degradation, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interaction.",
