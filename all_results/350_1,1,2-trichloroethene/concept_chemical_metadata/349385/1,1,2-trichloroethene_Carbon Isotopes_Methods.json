    "context": "The samples for \u03b413C of TCE and cis-DCE analysis were collected in triplicate in 40-mL amber vials fitted with septa and were preserved by the addition of NaOH. The analytical process and determination of values used for \u03b413C were those described in Kaown et al. (2014a) and Hunkeler and Aravena (2000). For the carbon isotope analysis, 10 representative wells were selected from the monitoring wells situated between the source zone and the stream. The minimum concentrations of TCE in the carbon isotope analysis were approximately 30\u03bcg/L. The \u03b413C values of TCE (\u03b413CTCE) were then reported relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (\u03b413CVPDB) (Coplen, 1996), with an analytical precision of \u00b10.3\u2030 using the delta notation given by \u03b413C=(R/R std \u22121)1000 (\u2030); here R and Rstd are the isotope ratios of the sample and the \u03b413CVPDB standard, respectively.Microbial community analysis Water samples (20L each) were collected around the stream for the microbial community analysis. Samples were then filtered using a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), after which the filters were exfoliated using distilled water and subjected to total DNA extraction using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) (N\u00fcbel et al., 1997). Amplification was carried out using a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a final volume of 50\u03bcL, using 10\u00d7 Taq buffer dNTP mixture (Takara, Shiga, Japan). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed for its carbon isotope composition, specifically \u03b413C values, which are crucial for understanding its source and behavior in the environment. The \u03b413C values of TCE are measured relative to a standard, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and carbon isotopes in the context of environmental monitoring and analysis. However, the relationship is primarily analytical rather than biological or chemical in nature.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and carbon isotopes, as the analysis of \u03b413C values is essential for understanding TCE's environmental impact. The context provides quantitative details about the measurement process, indicating a strong relevance in the analytical chemistry domain.",
