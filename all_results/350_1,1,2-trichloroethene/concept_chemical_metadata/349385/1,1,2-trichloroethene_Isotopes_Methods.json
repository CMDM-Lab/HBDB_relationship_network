    "context": "The analytical process and determination of values used for \u03b413C were those described in Kaown et al. (2014a) and Hunkeler and Aravena (2000). For the carbon isotope analysis, 10 representative wells were selected from the monitoring wells situated between the source zone and the stream. The minimum concentrations of TCE in the carbon isotope analysis were approximately 30\u03bcg/L. The \u03b413C values of TCE (\u03b413CTCE) were then reported relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (\u03b413CVPDB) (Coplen, 1996), with an analytical precision of \u00b10.3\u2030 using the delta notation given by \u03b413C=(R/R std \u22121)1000 (\u2030); here R and Rstd are the isotope ratios of the sample and the \u03b413CVPDB standard, respectively.Microbial community analysis Water samples (20L each) were collected around the stream for the microbial community analysis. Samples were then filtered using a 0.22-\u03bcm filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), after which the filters were exfoliated using distilled water and subjected to total DNA extraction using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) (N\u00fcbel et al., 1997). Amplification was carried out using a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a final volume of 50\u03bcL, using 10\u00d7 Taq buffer dNTP mixture (Takara, Shiga, Japan). The amplification condition was the same as that given in Hur et al. (2013). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using carbon isotope analysis, specifically focusing on the \u03b413C values. The relationship between TCE and isotopes is established through the measurement of the carbon isotope ratios, which are essential for understanding the environmental behavior and source identification of TCE. However, the context does not delve into any biological or chemical interactions beyond the analytical methodology.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TCE is directly analyzed in relation to carbon isotopes, indicating a specific analytical relationship. However, there is no discussion of broader implications or interactions beyond the measurement process.",
