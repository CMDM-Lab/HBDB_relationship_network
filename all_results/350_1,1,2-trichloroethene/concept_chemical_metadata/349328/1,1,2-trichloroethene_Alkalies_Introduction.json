    "context": "More specifically, studies at the Riverfront Superfund Site (New Haven, MO) showed a clear soil-tree core relationship, stronger than that of groundwater PCE to tree core concentrations at the same site. This direct relationship was hypothesized to be caused by diffusion between tree roots and the soil vapor phase in the subsurface (Struckhoff et\u00a0al., 2005). Within the research and development project SILPHES (French acronym for Innovative Solutions to Fight Halogenated Compounds in Groundwater), we aimed at delineating subsurface CE contamination at a chlor-alkali facility using phytoscreening. We investigated a total of 170 trees that was sampled and analyzed by solid phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry for PCE and TCE concentrations, which are among the most common chlorinated solvents released by chlor-alkali production facilities. Our tree core data were compared with soil data to ascertain correlations between the two datasets, while taking into account variation in biological and pedogeological parameters. Description of the chlor-alkali facility The chlor-alkali facility owned by the chemical company INOVYN is located in Tavaux (France) and was first established in 1930. Industrial activities based on the exploitation and processing of salt were developed by a specialization in the manufacture of chlorinated solvents and plastics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a common chlorinated solvent associated with chlor-alkali production facilities, while alkalies refer to the chemical compounds used in the chlor-alkali process. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their association with the chlor-alkali industry. The focus is more on the environmental impact of TCE rather than its chemical relationship with alkalies.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the chlor-alkali production process, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or functional relationship in the context provided.",
