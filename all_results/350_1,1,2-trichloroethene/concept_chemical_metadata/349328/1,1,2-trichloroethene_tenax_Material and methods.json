    "context": "A micro-coring device was used to further allow for recovering a micro soil core of approximately 2\u00a0g from the middle of the previously collected soil core, as previously described (C\u00f4me et\u00a0al., 2008). Soil samples were placed into 20\u00a0mL polytetrafluoroethylene-sealed headspace vials, after removal of roots and other woody materials. In January 2016, passive soil gas measurements were conducted at 8 sampling points in the PW67 zone by installing a polyethylene pipe (diameter 44\u00a0mm) to a depth of 1.5\u00a0m, with a porous section between 1.5\u00a0m and 1\u00a0m depth, allowing the diffusion of hydrocarbon volatile organic carbon (HVOC) in the pipe. TENAX\u00ae-GR (Sigma) 40/80 mesh porous polymer adsorbent tubes (150\u00a0mg), which have a high affinity for CE, were placed on top of sealed pipes for 3\u00a0h.Analytical method Concentrations of TCE and PCE in tree cores and soil cores were determined by solid phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) using a gas chromatograph Agilent 7890\u00a0GC equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer 5975C MSD (Agilent), and a Gerstel MPS (MultiPurpose Sampler) SPME mode with a 85\u00a0\u03bcM carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber (Supelco-Sigma). Upon receipt in the laboratory at sampling day, samples were prepared for analysis within the next day. Before analysis, both tree and soil core samples were allowed to equilibrate in the vials for 12\u00a0h\u00a0at room temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C) and SPME fibers were conditioned in the GC injection port by fully exposing them for 30\u00a0min\u00a0at 280\u00a0\u00b0C. Samples were heated at 30\u00a0\u00b0C in an incubator for 30\u00a0min in order to avoid a potential influence of ambient temperature fluctuations. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed as part of soil gas measurements, while Tenax is used as a porous polymer adsorbent for capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like TCE. The Tenax tubes are employed to collect and concentrate TCE from the soil gas for subsequent analysis using gas chromatography. This indicates a direct functional relationship where Tenax serves as a tool for measuring TCE concentrations in environmental samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Tenax, as Tenax is specifically utilized to adsorb TCE for analytical purposes, demonstrating a clear and relevant interaction in the context of environmental monitoring.",
        "score": 4
