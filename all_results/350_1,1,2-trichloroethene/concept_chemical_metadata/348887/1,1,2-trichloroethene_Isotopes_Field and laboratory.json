    "context": "In this study, 54 samples were collected for isotope analyses (December 2000) from selected multilevels: Transect 1: ML-10, ML-11 and ML-26; Transect 2: ML-16, ML-18, ML-32 and ML-34; and Transect 3: ML-40 and ML-42; from piezometer nests DP-1, DP-4, DP-5, PN-3 and PN-4 and from the pond. Analyses were performed using methods described by Hunkeler et al. (2004), which allow determination on samples with very low (\u03bcg/L range) VOC concentrations. Duplicate samples were collected from each location for VOC analyses as described earlier. Results of TCE isotope analyses on groundwater and DNAPL samples from the source zone (Hunkeler et al., 2003) provide the starting composition for comparison to plume results. Carbon isotope data are reported using delta notation; defined as \u03b4 13C=(R s / R r \u22121)\u00d71000, where R s and R r are the 13C/12C ratios of the sample and a reference standard, respectively. VOC distribution and mass discharge across the transects The distribution of VOCs along the transects and estimates of mass discharges are first presented, showing the plume is strongly attenuated in the groundwater system. Causes of attenuation are then evaluated focusing on the effects of groundwater\u2013surface water interactions with the pond and streams and evidence for degradation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed alongside isotopes to study its distribution and degradation in groundwater samples. The isotope analyses, particularly carbon isotopes, are used to understand the composition and behavior of TCE in the environment. However, the relationship is primarily methodological, focusing on the use of isotopes to track TCE rather than a direct interaction between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is analyzed using isotopes for environmental studies. While they are related through the methodology of analysis, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond this analytical context.",
