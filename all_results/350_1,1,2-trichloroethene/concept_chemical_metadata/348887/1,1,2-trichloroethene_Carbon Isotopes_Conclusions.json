    "context": "Fig. 13 is a schematic representation of the VOC attenuation (mass loss) and mass flux pathways for the site. The investigation of groundwater\u2013surface water interaction indicates that, although only very small plume VOC mass discharge enters the river via groundwater seepage, roughly half of the plume mass discharge crossing Transect 1 enters the river directly via small streams receiving groundwater discharge east of the river; hence, the importance of mass discharge estimates. The other half is apparently lost from the hydrologic system by mass transfer from surface water (pond, streams, seeps) to the atmosphere and by degradation. The occurrence of degradation is supported by VOC distributions, hydrogeochemical conditions and compound-specific carbon isotope data, indicating that both TCE and cis-DCE degrade. Although it is unknown whether much VOC mass is lost by complete dechlorination, such loss likely occurs locally. Occurrence of reductive dechlorination may be largest during plume discharge through organic-rich near surface sediments and bottom sediments in the pond and streams. Although the river receives TCE and degradation products from the groundwater zone and streams, these contaminants are not detected in the river due to dilution. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation in the environment, with carbon isotope data being used to support the investigation of its degradation pathways. The carbon isotopes provide insights into the processes affecting TCE and its degradation products, indicating that isotopic analysis can help trace the fate of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and surface water interactions. However, the specific relationship between TCE and carbon isotopes is not elaborated in detail beyond their association in the study of degradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as carbon isotopes are used to analyze the degradation of TCE, indicating a connection between the two. However, the context does not provide extensive details on their direct interaction or significance beyond the use of isotopic data.",
