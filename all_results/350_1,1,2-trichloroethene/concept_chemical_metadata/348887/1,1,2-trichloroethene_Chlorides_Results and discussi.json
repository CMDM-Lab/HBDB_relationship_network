    "context": "Along Transect 1 (ML-10) conditions are aerobic with nitrate and sulfate present, very low dissolved iron and manganese (mostly below MDLs) and negligible DOC. These conditions are not supportive of reductive dechlorination (e.g. Wiedemeier et al., 1999; Chapelle, 2001), and are consistent with minimal TCE transformation to cis-DCE between the source and Transect 1. \u201cBackground\u201d chloride values along Transect 1 were in the 10s of mg/L, suggesting chloride increases would not be a useful indicator of reductive dechlorination (e.g. complete dechlorination of 5000\u00a0\u03bcg/L of TCE would produce about 4000\u00a0\u03bcg/L of chloride, likely too small to be distinguished from background levels). Along the lower terrace, conditions are more amenable for reductive dechlorination, presumably due to input of natural DOC given the near surface position of the water table and natural soil cover (forested/wetland/grassy areas). Beyond the base of the embankment close to x-stream at DP-2 (Fig. 3), DO was low (<1\u00a0mg/L, possibly anaerobic), nitrate was very low to non-detect, dissolved iron and manganese were detected (maximum of 1.4 and 0.3\u00a0mg/L, respectively) and redox potential was the most reducing measured along the plume flowpath (\u2212360\u00a0mV, uncorrected). Methane was also detected (up to 970\u00a0\u03bcg/L) along with traces of ethane and ethene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and chlorides are mentioned in relation to the conditions affecting reductive dechlorination processes. The presence of chlorides is noted as a potential byproduct of TCE transformation, but the background chloride levels are too low to serve as a reliable indicator of dechlorination. Thus, while both terms are related through the chemical transformation process, their direct relationship is not emphasized or quantitatively supported in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between TCE and chlorides, as they are both involved in the discussion of dechlorination processes. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or significant relevance between them, limiting their relationship to a general association.",
