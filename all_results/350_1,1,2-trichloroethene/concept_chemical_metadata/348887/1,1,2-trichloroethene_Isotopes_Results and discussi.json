    "context": "Along Transect 1 \u03b4 13C values for TCE range from \u221222.6 to \u221221.6\u2030 with an average of \u221222.2\u2030 (11 samples), similar to source zone groundwater (32 samples, range \u221222.5 to \u221221.4\u2030 with an average \u03b4 13C value of \u221222.0\u2030) and DNAPL (\u221221.8\u2030) provided by Hunkeler et al. (2003). \u03b4 13C values for cis-DCE in the few samples where it was detected were similar to TCE (4 samples, range \u221222.9 to \u221222.5\u2030). Assuming cis-DCE degradation has not occurred to this point, which is reasonable given hydrogeochemical conditions and VC absence along Transect 1, the small difference between TCE and cis-DCE ratios suggests a small isotope enrichment factor for TCE degradation at this site. Along Transect 2, \u03b4 13C values for TCE (8 samples, range \u221222.0 to \u221217.0\u2030, average \u221221.1\u2030) show a small average enrichment of +1.3\u2030 compared to Transect 1, with one sample downgradient of the pond (ML32-5) showing a larger enrichment of +5.2\u2030. Such shifts are at the low end observed in lab microcosm studies of microbial TCE degradation (e.g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed for its carbon isotope ratios (\u03b413C values) to assess its degradation processes in groundwater. The isotopic analysis provides insights into the environmental behavior of TCE, indicating small differences in isotope enrichment factors during degradation. This relationship highlights the use of isotopes as a tool for understanding the fate of TCE in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and isotopes, as the context discusses the use of carbon isotopes to evaluate TCE degradation. The quantitative data on \u03b413C values supports this relationship, indicating a clear relevance in environmental chemistry.",
