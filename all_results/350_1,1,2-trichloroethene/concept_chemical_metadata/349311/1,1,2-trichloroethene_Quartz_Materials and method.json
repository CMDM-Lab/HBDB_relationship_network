    "context": "60\u00a0PVs of F-NZVI were injected via up-flow mode to place the NZVI in the column. Then, the sand with the NZVI placement was dissected into eight 2-cm long segments followed by placing each segment onto the induction coil supplying the LF-EMF at a frequency of 150\u00a0kHz and current density of 13 A for 15\u00a0min, and the temperature was then recorded. The same experiment, except generating F-NZVI using 100\u00a0g/L NZVI in 3% SLES (w/w), was also carried out to evaluate the effect of a higher deposited NZVI concentration on \u0394T in the unsaturated porous media.Enhanced TCE evaporation by F-NZVI with MIH F-NZVI coupled with MIH was investigated for its capabilities of enhancing TCE evaporation in a batch study. The 25-ml glass vial in this experiment contained 2\u00a0mL of F-NZVI (generated using the optimal condition, i.e., 100\u00a0g/L NZVI in 3% (w/w) SLES and a 500\u00a0mL/min N2 rate) and 17.20\u00a0g of quartz sand with three different water saturations (WS) (5%, 25%, and 50%) to establish the role of water saturation on enhanced TCE evaporation via F-NZVI and MIH. A pure phase TCE of 0.25\u00a0mL (or 3.5% saturation) was pipetted into the vial prior to being promptly capped with Teflon Mininert\u2122 to prevent TCE gas leaving the reactor. The reactor was homogenized in an orbital shaker for 30\u00a0min prior to the study. Control reactors, including TCE in sand without F-NZVI, were created via the same setup with the same three WS. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and quartz are mentioned in relation to an experiment investigating the evaporation of TCE enhanced by the presence of F-NZVI (functionalized nanoscale zero-valent iron) in quartz sand. The study examines how different water saturations in quartz sand affect TCE evaporation, but does not detail any direct chemical interaction between TCE and quartz itself, focusing instead on the role of F-NZVI.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as TCE and quartz are connected through their roles in the experimental setup, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between them beyond their co-occurrence in the study.",
        "score": 2
