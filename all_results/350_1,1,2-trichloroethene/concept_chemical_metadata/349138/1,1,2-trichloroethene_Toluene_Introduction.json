    "context": "Anaerobic biodegradation transforms TCE to lesser-chlorinated compounds by reductive dechlorination. The general pathway is: TCE\u21d2cDCE\u21d2VC\u21d2ethylene (Fathepure and Tiedje, 1994). Diverse microorganisms include methanogenic, Fe (III)-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria have been shown to anaerobically biodegrade TCE through different pathways, and different consortia of bacteria are often involved in biodegradation of TCE (Wilson et al., 1986; Freedman and Gossett, 1989; Smatlak et al., 1996; Bagley and Gossett, 1990; Lovely and Anderson, 2000). TCE can also be cometabolically biodegraded by some aerobic bacteria that utilize methane, phenol or toluene as a sole carbon source (Vogel, 1994; McCarty et al., 1998; Harker and Kim, 1990; Fries et al., 1997b). Demonstration of biodegradation includes description of the microbial community at the site and identification of organisms responsible for the metabolism of contaminants (Dojka et al., 1998; Chapelle and Bradley, 1998). Microorganisms capable of biodegradation TCE have been isolated directly from environmental samples or microcosms (Fries et al., 1997b; Wild et al., 1996; Sharma and McCarty, 1996; Maymo-Gatell et al., 1997; Byl and Williams, 2000). Only a few studies have been performed using molecular techniques to characterize microbial communities at field sites undergoing natural attenuation (Fries et al., 1997a; Stapleton et al., 2000; Dojka et al., 1998).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are related through the process of biodegradation. TCE can be cometabolically biodegraded by certain aerobic bacteria that utilize toluene as a carbon source. This indicates that toluene can play a role in the microbial degradation pathways of TCE, highlighting a functional relationship between the two compounds in environmental bioremediation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and toluene, as the context discusses how toluene serves as a carbon source for bacteria that can biodegrade TCE. This relationship is supported by evidence of microbial interactions in biodegradation pathways.",
        "score": 4
