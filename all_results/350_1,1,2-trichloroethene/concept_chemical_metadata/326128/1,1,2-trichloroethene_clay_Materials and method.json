    "context": "A 100\u03bcl of 3-day-old culture of G4 was added through an opening in the ampule and then immediately resealed. The controls were treated similarly but the G4 was not added. The ampules were immediately sealed for 48h. The MSB in the ampules was sampled and analyzed for TCE.The effects of PM-100 clay on TCE degradation In order to determine the effect of TCE adsorption to PM-100 on the TCE-degrading ability by G4, three concentrations of TCE (10, 20 and 30ppm) were employed. A 1g of the clay was added to each 10ml ampule using a spatula. Sterile MSB (2.5ml) was added to the ampules and TCE was added in the form of a TCE\u2013methanol solution. All ampules were immediately sealed without the addition of G4 and incubated for 24h on an orbital shaker to allow TCE time to reach equilibrium between the three phases before the start of degradation.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and clay are related through an experimental setup investigating the effect of PM-100 clay on the degradation of TCE. The study examines how the adsorption of TCE to the clay influences the TCE-degrading ability of a microbial culture. The relationship is focused on the interaction between TCE and the clay in the context of environmental degradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and clay, as the study provides evidence of how clay affects TCE degradation, indicating a clear functional relationship in the context of environmental bioremediation.",
        "score": 4
