    "context": "A 100\u03bcl of 3-day-old culture of G4 was added through an opening in the ampule and then immediately resealed. The controls were treated similarly but the G4 was not added. The ampules were immediately sealed for 48h. The MSB in the ampules was sampled and analyzed for TCE.The effects of PM-100 clay on TCE degradation In order to determine the effect of TCE adsorption to PM-100 on the TCE-degrading ability by G4, three concentrations of TCE (10, 20 and 30ppm) were employed. A 1g of the clay was added to each 10ml ampule using a spatula. Sterile MSB (2.5ml) was added to the ampules and TCE was added in the form of a TCE\u2013methanol solution. All ampules were immediately sealed without the addition of G4 and incubated for 24h on an orbital shaker to allow TCE time to reach equilibrium between the three phases before the start of degradation.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being studied for its degradation in the presence of PM-100 clay. The experiment assesses how different concentrations of TCE interact with PM-100 to determine its effect on TCE degradation by a microbial culture (G4). The relationship is focused on the adsorption of TCE to PM-100 and its subsequent degradation, indicating a direct interaction between the two substances in the context of environmental remediation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and PM-100, as the study investigates the effect of PM-100 on TCE degradation, providing evidence of their interaction in the context of environmental science.",
        "score": 4
