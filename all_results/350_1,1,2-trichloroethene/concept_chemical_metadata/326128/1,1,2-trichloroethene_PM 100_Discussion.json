    "context": "However, this rate of TCE degradation was significantly less than the rate observed when no PM-100 clay was present. Alternatively, the desorption rate of the TCE from the PM-100 clay may be enhanced by the addition of a synthetic surfactant but the impact of the surfactant on the G4 and its degradative ability is unknown. In summary, this investigation showed that G4 could effectively remove TCE from PM-100 clay and in effect rejuvenate the absorbent, however, the desorption rate of TCE from the clay into the aqueous phase was rate limiting. If TCE were removed from the PM-100 clay using hexadecane, G4 was shown to remove the TCE from the hexdecane at a rate significantly faster than TCE removal from the clay itself. Trichloroethylene (TCE/C2Cl3H) has historically been one of the most widely used industrial solvents in North America, popular due to its rapid evaporation rate and low reactivity (Doherty, 2000). Historical heavy use in conjunction with improper disposal practices and accidental releases has resulted in widespread contamination of soils and groundwater with TCE. Conventional pump-and-treat systems, the most widely used strategy for groundwater remediation, can be difficult to apply to TCE-contaminated aquifers (Hoffman, 1993; Mackay and Cherry, 1989). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to PM-100 clay, which is used as an absorbent for TCE. The study indicates that the degradation rate of TCE is significantly lower when PM-100 clay is present, suggesting a direct interaction where PM-100 affects the desorption and degradation processes of TCE. The investigation highlights the role of PM-100 in TCE remediation, emphasizing its importance in environmental cleanup efforts.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and PM-100, as the context provides evidence of their interaction in the degradation and desorption processes. The study indicates that PM-100 plays a crucial role in the remediation of TCE, supported by quantitative observations.",
