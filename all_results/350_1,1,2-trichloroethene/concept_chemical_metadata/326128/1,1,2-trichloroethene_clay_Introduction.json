    "context": "This investigation was undertaken to evaluate methods by which absorbent used to remove TCE from contaminated water can be recycled. Two options were investigated. The first option was to determine if G4 could remove the TCE from the clay directly (by degrading the TCE in the aqueous phase). The second option was to determine if TCE, which had been removed from the clay by a solvent (n-hexadecane), could be removed from the solvent by G4. Mineral salts broth The mineral salts broth (MSB) employed in this study consisted of Sodium phosphate, dibasic 1.42g Potassium phosphate, monobasic 1.36g Ammonium sulfate 0.75g Magnesium sulfate\u00b77H2O 0.07g Nitrilotriacetic acid, disodium salt 0.06g Trace mineral solution 10ml DI water 990ml The water used in this study had been deionized (DI) and purified by a Milli-Q UV plus system equipped with a Q-Pak deionizing cartridges. The pH of the MSB was adjusted to 7.0+0.02 by adding 1N potassium hydroxide once the solution was clear. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is evaluated for its removal from contaminated water using clay as an absorbent. The study investigates two methods: one where TCE is degraded in the aqueous phase by G4 while in contact with clay, and another where TCE is extracted from clay using a solvent. The relationship highlights the role of clay in the remediation process of TCE contamination, although the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TCE and clay are connected through the investigation of TCE removal methods involving clay. However, the details of their interaction and effectiveness are not extensively discussed.",
