    "context": "However, higher molecular weight intermediates and polymers are formed in nitrogen, which are slow to mineralize completely. (vi) The presence of moisture is beneficial for VOC degradation in both air and nitrogen, except when moisture competes with the organic compounds for the absorption of 185nm photons, and when there is no reactive hydrogen present in the structure of the organic compound (e.g., CTC). UV photooxidation to treat effluents contaminated with chlorinated VOCs from air stripping and soil vapor oxidation is feasible, and the rate is rather high if the oxidation is conducted at high initial concentrations of the chlorinated organics in the presence of moisture and higher intensity 185nm radiation. Windholz et al. describes trichloroethylene (TCE) as a non-flammable, volatile organochlorine compound with a density of 1.4649 at 20\u00b0C, practically insoluble in water, but soluble in fixed and volatile oils and most alcohols. In 1985, 90,000t of TCE were used by industry in the US alone. Folsom et al. stated that prior to 1960, TCE was a widely used degreasing agent, anesthetic, and coolant but has since been placed on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) list of priority pollutants. Shannon reported that the inadequate disposal practices for TCE have created numerous TCE-contaminated superfund sites. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is identified as a chlorinated volatile organic compound (VOC) that is part of a broader category of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The discussion focuses on the degradation of chlorinated VOCs, including 1,1,2-trichloroethene, through UV photooxidation processes. While the relationship is acknowledged, the context does not delve into specific interactions or implications between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons beyond their classification.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related through their classification as chlorinated hydrocarbons, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships in the context provided.",
