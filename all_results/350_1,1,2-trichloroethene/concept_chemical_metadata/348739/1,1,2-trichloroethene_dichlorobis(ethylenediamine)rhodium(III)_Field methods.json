    "context": "Aquifer slug-test results indicated saturated hydraulic conductivity values ranging between 0.01 and 8\u00a0m/day. The lower estimates are representative of the aquitards, while the higher estimates are those of the permeable aquifers. Based on groundwater monitoring data collected in 2002 by an environmental firm 1 , the TCE plume dimensions at this site were estimated to be \u223c1.2\u00a0km long and \u223c0.3\u00a0km wide (Fig. 1). Apart from TCE, only trace amounts of the dechlorination by-product cis-1,2-DCE were detected at a few locations near the source, suggesting low-levels of microbial reductive dechlorination activity in this aquifer. Initial site characterization indicated that the TCE plume was confined to the shallow aquifer zone (\u223c12\u201323\u00a0m bgs), bounded by a low permeability stiff clay layer. Subsequent data, including the present investigation, confirm that TCE contamination has penetrated deeper, at least up to 30\u00a0m bgs. Thus, the three surficial aquifers of interest to the present study are the Q1, Q2, and Q3 aquifers, which are affected by episodes of recharge from infiltration. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to groundwater contamination, while dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) is not mentioned at all. There is no direct or indirect relationship established between TCE and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) in the provided information, as the focus is solely on TCE's environmental impact and its plume characteristics.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects the absence of any relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) in the context, as they are not discussed together or related in any way.",
