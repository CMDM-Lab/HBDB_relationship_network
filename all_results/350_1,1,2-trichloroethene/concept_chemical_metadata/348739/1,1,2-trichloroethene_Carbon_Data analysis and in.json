    "context": "Our analysis suggests that in about a decade (representing about 2\u20133 half lives) the residual TCE mass in the source zone would be depleted such that the flux-averaged TCE concentration leaving the source control plane would satisfy this standard, and thus, the practical lifetime of the source can be assumed to be equal to a decade. Note, however, that local concentrations are quite variable and after a decade there would still be some locations along the source control plane where TCE may be as high as 600\u00a0\u00b5g/L.Plume mass, plume mass discharge and plume migration rate TCE plume mass in groundwater was estimated to be equal to 1000\u20131250\u00a0kg by integrating the plume contours (Fig. 1) based on sampling done in 2002. Additional TCE mass associated with the sorbed phase will also have to be accounted for, but the necessary site information on sorption K d is unavailable. Benker et al. (1998) have compared several methods for estimating TCE sorption K d for low-carbon aquifer materials. A retardation factor (R) of 2 has been used (see Basu et al., 2006), assuming a soil organic carbon content (f oc) of 0.001, a porosity of 0.3, and an organic carbon normalized partition coefficient (K oc) of 130\u00a0L/kg suggested by Newell et al. (1996). With R =2, the total TCE in the plume is estimated to be \u223c2000\u20132500\u00a0kg. TCE mass discharge [M D, g/day or kg/year] across the plume transect was estimated to be equal to 5.7\u00a0g/day (3 to 8\u00a0g/day), 7 7 Note that the numbers in the parentheses indicate the range of values assuming the correction factor \u03b1 to vary between 0.7 and 1.8.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its environmental behavior in groundwater, particularly its mass and concentration over time. Carbon is indirectly referenced through the mention of soil organic carbon content and its role in estimating TCE sorption. However, there is no direct relationship or interaction between TCE and carbon beyond its role in the sorption process, which is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the environmental analysis of TCE in groundwater, with carbon mentioned in the context of sorption. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or significant interaction.",
