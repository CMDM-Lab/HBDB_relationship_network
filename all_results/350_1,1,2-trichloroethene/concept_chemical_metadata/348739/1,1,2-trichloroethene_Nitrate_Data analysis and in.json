    "context": "This is reasonably close to the observed mass discharge of \u223c3\u00a0g/day [We attribute this difference to the large number of assumptions made in the estimate]. Note that we are not claiming that our estimates are exact; however, the observation of a greater mass discharge across the plume transect compared to the source transect, lends credence to the hypothesis that the source is decaying (due to DNAPL dissolution) while degradation processes in the plume are minimal. The organic constituent analysis indicated absence of TCE degradation byproducts (e.g., DCE, VC, etc.) at most wells in the plume. In addition, detectable nitrate (2\u20138\u00a0mg/L) and sulfate (200\u2013450\u00a0mg/L) concentrations, high Eh (100\u2013200\u00a0mV), and high DO (2\u20136\u00a0mg/L) values indicated oxidizing conditions in the TCE plume [data summarized in Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Information]. Reductive dechlorination of TCE is unlikely under these geochemical conditions. Note that the estimated TCE mass discharges across the source and plume transect are subject to uncertainty arising from interpolation errors. The magnitude of the uncertainty is a function of the correlation structure of the flux distribution, spacing of the wells, and the vertical sampling interval (see, Kubert and Finkel, 2006). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and nitrate are mentioned in relation to the geochemical conditions of a TCE plume. The presence of detectable nitrate concentrations (2\u20138 mg/L) suggests oxidizing conditions, which are not conducive to the reductive dechlorination of TCE. This indicates that while both substances are present in the same environment, their relationship is primarily based on the geochemical context rather than a direct interaction or metabolic relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between TCE and nitrate, as they are both part of the same environmental study. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond the observation of nitrate in oxidizing conditions affecting TCE degradation.",
