    "context": "The well-averaged groundwater and TCE fluxes (<q d> and <J d>), and the mass discharge across the source and plume transects are shown in Table 2 . The concentrations of DCE and other by-products of TCE were below the Limits of Quantification (LOQ) for the GC analytical protocols used. The data from PFM measurements, traditional groundwater sampling of TCE and other organic and inorganic constituents, and on-line VOC probes were integrated to develop an improved conceptual site model. In the following sections, we discuss the key elements of hydrogeologic and TCE source/plume characterization of the site.Hydrogeologic characterization The PFM measurements at MW218 and MW241 provided seasonal information on the depth distribution of groundwater fluxes between 14 and 31\u00a0m bgs (Q2 and Q3 aquifers). The correspondence between the groundwater flux profiles determined from three PFM deployments over a period of about one year (February, May, and October 2006) indicates that seasonal fluctuations in groundwater flow patterns are not significant. Two distinct zones of larger groundwater fluxes were observed (Fig. 2) consistent with soil type distributions obtained from borehole logs (Fig. 2) and other site monitoring data that report the presence of two aquifers (Q2 and Q3) separated by a confining unit. The location of the confining unit, determined by decreasing sand content and increasing clay content in the borehole logs, corresponded with decreasing groundwater fluxes as measured by the PFM (Fig. 2).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to groundwater and hydrogeologic characterization, but there is no direct mention of 'Elements' as a specific term. The focus is on TCE concentrations and groundwater fluxes, with elements likely referring to various constituents analyzed in the study. However, the relationship between TCE and 'Elements' is not explicitly defined or explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Elements, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
