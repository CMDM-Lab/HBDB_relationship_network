    "context": "On the other hand, the photodegradation pathways of chlorohydrocarbons could mainly contributed to a direct photolysis and Cl radical initiated/sensitized oxidation reactions. This implied that CCl bond in chlorohydrocarbon molecules might be cleaved upon adsorption of UV light irradiation, and the generated Cl free radial may subsequently offence the molecule to accelerate the degradation rate. In order to have a kinetic comparison of the photolytic and photocatalytic degradation of these vapors, the apparent zero-order reaction rate constants were calculated and presented in Table 1 . It can be seen that the photodegradation rate for the VOCs studied through photolysis followed an order: TCE>chloroform>dichloromethane>toluene>benzene>carbon tetrachloride, and through photocatalysis followed an order: TCE>chloroform>toluene>dichloromethane>benzene>carbon tetrachloride.Photocatalytic degradation of benzene over several catalysts It has been experimentally testified that benzene could not be degraded through photolysis but could be done, despite slowly, through photocatalysis under irradiation of germicidal lamp. Thus, photocatalytic degradation of benzene as a typical compound was performed to evaluate the prepared catalysts. An apparent zero-order kinetic equation was applied to extract the reaction rate constants. As shown in Fig. 3 , one could observe that the activity P25 TiO2 was enhanced by depositing 0.5wt% of Ag, but Pt deposited catalyst was not superior to P25 TiO2. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) undergoing photodegradation processes. The study compares their degradation rates under photolysis and photocatalysis, indicating that toluene has a slower degradation rate than 1,1,2-trichloroethene. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their degradation kinetics rather than any direct interaction or functional relationship between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are analyzed in the same study regarding their degradation rates, indicating a comparative relationship. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or shared mechanisms beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "score": 3
