    "context": "Selection of the sorbate was based on the environmental relevance of the material, use in prior studies, as well as practical application of experimental protocols using the selected sorbate. HPLC-grade (99.5%) TCE was obtained from Mallinckrodt (Paris, KY). Prior to performing sorption studies, liquid TCE was purified according to the distillation procedure described in Micromeritics Application Note 95 (Micromeritics, 1995).Mineral coating protocols 2.2.1 Coating procedure A weighed and tared glass flask was filled with 500g of prepared 0.1M NaCl solution; the solution was prepared by dissolving 5.844g of NaCl (\u2a7e 99.0%) which was obtained from Fisher Scientific (Springfield, NJ) in 1L of Milli-Q water. The solution pH was adjusted to 7 using 0.01M NaOH (Fisher Scientific, Springfield, NJ). The flask was fit with a stopper that allowed the solution to be continuously purged with dry nitrogen (>99.0% purity; A.L Compressed Gases, Inc., Nashville, TN). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its use in sorption studies, while minerals are referenced in the context of a sodium chloride solution preparation. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship established between TCE and minerals. They are part of separate experimental protocols without any indication of how they might influence each other or interact chemically.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and minerals, as they are mentioned in different contexts without any direct or indirect connection or relevance to each other.",
