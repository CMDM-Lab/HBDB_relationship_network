    "context": "This procedure is repeated for each of the pressure points obtained. The equilibration time varied depending upon the isotherm dose used for each isotherm point and was directly related to the ability of the instrument to measure set pressure differentials as provided by the instrument\u2019s very sensitive 1torr pressure transducers. Verification of equilibration was determined by comparison between a batch isotherm method using a sealed glass ampoule system for long term (weeks) sorption and the sequential sorption isotherm method using the Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument, each at a mid-point temperature of 35\u00b0C. Sorption onto mineral materials Sorption isotherms onto 6X75 using TCE for three low and three high experimental temperatures are shown in Fig. 1 a and b, respectively. Since 6X75 is a microporous material, the Dubinin\u2013Raduskevich and Dubinin\u2013Astahkov micropore models were used to fit all sorption isotherms. Characteristic curves were defined separately for the two sets of experimental temperatures for comparison with coated materials (high and low temperatures). Model results for the characteristic isotherms are presented in Table 2 .Sorption onto coated materials Previous studies have shown a relationship between NOM content and VOC sorptive uptake (Boyd et al., 1988; Pennell et al., 1992; Dural and Chen, 1997); noting that soils with higher organic carbon content possessed greater sorption capacity for volatile organic compounds in experiments that had little or no humidity present.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its sorption onto mineral materials, specifically using a microporous material (6X75) for sorption isotherm studies. The relationship is primarily focused on the interaction of TCE with mineral surfaces, indicating that the mineral properties may influence the sorption capacity for volatile organic compounds like TCE. However, the context does not elaborate on specific interactions or implications of this relationship beyond the experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between TCE and minerals, as they are both involved in the sorption process. However, the relationship lacks detailed discussion or evidence of significant interaction, making it more of a general association rather than a direct or critical relationship.",
