    "context": "2.2.4 Sequential dosing isotherm method Isotherms were obtained for uncoated and coated materials using an automated sequential dosing method. Equilibrium sorption isotherms for LHA were collected in an associated study (Bell and LeBoeuf, in press). In order to evaluate equilibrium behavior of TCE onto these model soils, a sequential dosing method with the Micromeretics ASAP 2010 was used. The ASAP 2010 is equipped with a hydrocarbon manifold so liquids that possess a vapor pressure of at least 1mm Hg at room temperature and <10\u03bcm Hg at liquid nitrogen temperature could be used as sorbates in obtaining equilibrium isotherms (TCE meets this requirement). Vapor phase equilibrium isotherms were collected at experimental temperatures of 15\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, 35\u00b0C, 75\u00b0C, 95\u00b0C, and 115\u00b0C corresponding to three temperatures above and three temperatures below the glass transition temperature of LHA (Tg =74\u00b13\u00b0C (DeLapp et al., 2004)). Samples were degassed on one of two degas ports. Degas temperatures were 105\u00b0C for all samples with the exception of the highest temperature isotherms at 115\u00b0C in which case the degas temperature was 115\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed as a specific chemical that meets the criteria for vapor phase equilibrium sorption isotherms, which are typically evaluated for hydrocarbons. While TCE is a chlorinated solvent and not a hydrocarbon itself, it is included in the study of sorption behaviors relevant to hydrocarbon interactions, indicating a broader context of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their environmental behavior. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its inclusion in the methodology for evaluating sorption isotherms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as TCE is mentioned in the context of hydrocarbon sorption studies, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or relevance to hydrocarbons beyond its classification as a VOC.",
