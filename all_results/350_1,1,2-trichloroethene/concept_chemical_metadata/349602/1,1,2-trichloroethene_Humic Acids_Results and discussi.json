    "context": "However, the half-time method does not account for the relaxation phenomenon for TCE transport in glassy humic acid (Bell and LeBoeuf, in preparation). Thus, although organic matter coatings may be thin, if they exist in a rigid, glassy state, the relaxation-controlled process governing transport behavior of the sorbate could limit access to the internal pore spaces within the sorbent. Additionally, consideration should be given to the possibility that the humic acid coating is itself a sorption medium, albeit with a very small capacity relative to the mesoporous mineral. The humic acid then would require not only time for uptake of TCE, but also time for release (desorption) before the sorbate could access the interior pore spaces. Again using the half-time estimation for sorption and desorption as processes in series results in time scales of less than a minute; thus, even considering the diffusion time as a series process, the slow macromolecular relaxation process characteristic of the glassy state may still be a limiting and controlling factor. Previous studies have reported that the adsorption capacity for organic compounds in a soil under low relative humidities (<20%) is primarily controlled by the mineral matter, while the organic matter plays only a secondary role in the process (Chiou et al., 1985; Dural and Chen, 1997). This study, however, demonstrates that differences in sorptive capacity may not be entirely associated with differences in surface areas of the mineral matrices; likely, there is either a blockage of pore space available to the VOC or a kinetic limitation that does not allow the VOC to access the internal porosity of the model soil within the time periods of the experiment.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport behavior in glassy humic acids. The study highlights that the rigid state of humic acid may limit TCE's access to internal pore spaces, affecting its sorption and desorption processes. While humic acids are acknowledged as a sorption medium, their capacity is considered small compared to mineral matter, indicating a complex interaction where humic acids influence TCE transport dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and humic acids, as the context discusses their interaction in terms of transport and sorption behavior. The evidence provided indicates that the physical state of humic acids affects TCE's accessibility, showcasing a clear relationship within the study's framework.",
