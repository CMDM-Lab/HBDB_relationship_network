    "context": "For instance, benzene and TCE concentrations monitored in gas-phase contaminated unsaturated zones have been reported to be as high as 660000\u03bcg/m3  and 55000\u03bcg/m3  , respectively. In addition, the use of the dissolution tube has advantages despite a high detection limit. When using the sorption tube, the sorbent must be carefully selected as high relative humidity and poor VOC-sorbent compatibility with the targeted compound can lead to significant isotope fractionation. For instance, despite low detection limit, Carbopack B showed strong carbon isotope fractionation for TCE, whereas no fractionation was observed for benzene. The presence of humidity in the air during sampling with the solvent method is likely to be negligible as the water will completely dissolve into methanol and the resulting fraction of water in solvent too small to create any co-solvent effect. Furthermore, during the sampling process, isotope fractionation is less likely to occur for VOC fully mixed in the solvent compared to repeated isotope-dependant sorption\u2013desorption steps. This investigation has successfully demonstrated the viability of the proposed solvent-based dissolution method for sampling gas-phase VOCs to perform CSIA. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to carbon isotopes, specifically regarding the phenomenon of isotope fractionation during sampling processes. The text highlights that TCE exhibits strong carbon isotope fractionation when using certain sorbents, which is significant for understanding its behavior in environmental monitoring. This relationship is crucial for accurate analysis in studies involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their isotopic signatures.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between TCE and carbon isotopes, as the context provides evidence of isotope fractionation specific to TCE during sampling. This indicates a clear relationship relevant to environmental chemistry and analysis, although it does not delve into broader implications or mechanisms.",
