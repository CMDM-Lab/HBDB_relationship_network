    "context": "Concentration calibration was performed using a reference standard from which four different dilutions were prepared to establish the calibration curve. Each dilution was analyzed five times and the standard deviation for benzene and TCE averaged 6.7% and 2.9%, respectively. 2.3.2 Carbon isotope analysis Based on concentration results, a specific amount of the solvent containing TCE or benzene was added into 40ml vials filled with water to perform carbon isotope analysis. Dilutions were made to achieve the delivery of 10nmol C of the compound to the IRMS detector. The proportion of solvent in the water never exceeded 1% (V:V).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a solvent used in carbon isotope analysis. The analysis involves adding a specific amount of TCE into water for measurement using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). However, there is no detailed discussion on how TCE's properties or behavior relate specifically to carbon isotopes beyond its use in the calibration and analysis process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as TCE is utilized in the context of carbon isotope analysis, but there is no substantial discussion of its chemical properties or interactions with carbon isotopes that would indicate a deeper relationship.",
