The diffusion coefficient of toluene through the geomembrane was determined by curve fitting using Eq. (3) as a function of D\u00b7t to a series of data points of toluene concentration in solution.Confined double compartment apparatus (CDCA) test for mass transfer of TCE through geomembrane A confined double compartment apparatus (CDCA) test was conducted to monitor the mass transfer of TCE through RGM and to verify that RGM was an effective barrier to mitigate the mass transfer. RGM was installed between compartments to set the Pd/Fe side of RGM to the solution chamber and compartments were jointed with a nitrile butadiene rubber gasket by bolts and nuts to minimize absorption to gasket and TCE loss through joint part as shown in Fig. 6 . A 100mg/L TCE solution was prepared in the solution chamber (SC) and deionized water was prepared in the water chamber (WC) without headspace. Each compartment was fully stirred by a magnetic bar. The partition coefficient, diffusion coefficient, and reaction rate constant of Pd/Fe, which determined the mass transfer of TCE through RGM, were obtained by curve fitting to a series of observed concentration data points in both chambers using mathematical model as shown below.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its mass transfer through a geomembrane, while nitriles are referenced in the context of the gasket material used to minimize absorption and loss of TCE. However, there is no direct discussion of a chemical or functional relationship between TCE and nitriles, indicating that they are only connected through the experimental setup rather than through any inherent chemical interaction or biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene and nitriles are mentioned in the same context but are not directly related in terms of chemical properties or interactions. Their connection is primarily through the experimental design rather than a significant relationship.",
