    "context": "The mathematical model of diffusion in a plane sheet in contact with a stirred solution of limited volume has been well defined. If M t denotes the total amount of diffusing substance that has entered the sheet at time t, and M \u221e denotes the corresponding quantity after infinite time, the solution is as follows: (3) M t M \u221e = 1 \u2212 \u2211 n = 1 \u221e 2 \u03b1 ( 1 + \u03b1 ) 1 + \u03b1 + \u03b1 2 q n 2 \u2009 exp \u2212 D q n 2 t l half 2 where q n s is the non-zero positive roots of tan(q n )=\u2212\u03b1(q n ) and \u03b1 = V c /K \u00b7 V HDPE, V c is volume of solution [L3], K is partition coefficient of a plane sheet (HDPE geomembrane) [dimensionless], V HDPE is volume of HDPE geomembrane specimen [L3], l half is half the thickness of a HDPE geomembrane specimen [L], and D is the diffusion coefficient [L2/T]. The diffusion coefficient of toluene through the geomembrane was determined by curve fitting using Eq. (3) as a function of D\u00b7t to a series of data points of toluene concentration in solution.Confined double compartment apparatus (CDCA) test for mass transfer of TCE through geomembrane A confined double compartment apparatus (CDCA) test was conducted to monitor the mass transfer of TCE through RGM and to verify that RGM was an effective barrier to mitigate the mass transfer. RGM was installed between compartments to set the Pd/Fe side of RGM to the solution chamber and compartments were jointed with a nitrile butadiene rubber gasket by bolts and nuts to minimize absorption to gasket and TCE loss through joint part as shown in Fig. 6 . A 100mg/L TCE solution was prepared in the solution chamber (SC) and deionized water was prepared in the water chamber (WC) without headspace. Each compartment was fully stirred by a magnetic bar. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned in relation to a study on diffusion through a geomembrane. The focus is on the mass transfer of TCE, with toluene's diffusion coefficient being determined as part of the experimental setup. However, there is no direct interaction or comparative analysis between TCE and toluene, as they are treated separately in the context of diffusion studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are involved in diffusion studies but are not directly related or compared in terms of their chemical properties or interactions. Their mention is more about their roles in the experimental setup rather than a significant relationship.",
