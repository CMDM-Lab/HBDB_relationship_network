    "context": "Effect of Pd/Fe coating on partition and diffusion coefficients The coating of Pd/Fe powder may extend the molecular pore of HDPE, and can increase the diffusivity of TCE through the geomembrane. Moreover, it may decrease the hydrophobicity of the HDPE surface because Pd/Fe is hydrophilic. Therefore, it is necessary to prove whether the Pd/Fe coating changes the values of the partition and diffusion coefficients of organic compounds. Batch immersion tests of Pd/Fe RGM and NGM in triplicate were conducted with toluene instead of TCE (Fig. 5) in order to determine the effect of Pd/Fe coating on the partition and diffusion coefficients indirectly because TCE was rapidly degraded by Pd/Fe, so it could barely be determined whether the decrease of TCE concentration in solution was occurred by dechlorination or by mass transfer through the geomembrane, while toluene was not degraded by Pd/Fe at ambient temperature. Partition and diffusion coefficients were evaluated from the result of batch immersion tests using Eqs. (2) and (3) and the sorption curves were illustrated in Fig. 7 . As a result of the student's t-test, the hypothesis that the partition and diffusion coefficients of toluene through RGM were identical to those through NGM was not rejected in both 90% and 95% confidence levels (Table 2 ).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both organic compounds evaluated in relation to the effects of a Pd/Fe coating on partition and diffusion coefficients through geomembranes. While TCE is rapidly degraded by the coating, toluene serves as a comparative control since it is not degraded under the same conditions. The study aims to indirectly assess the impact of the coating on TCE by using toluene to establish baseline diffusion and partition coefficients, highlighting their roles in the experimental design without a direct interaction between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are part of the same experimental setup, with toluene used to understand the behavior of TCE. However, their relationship is primarily functional rather than chemical, as they are not directly interacting but rather compared in the context of the study.",
