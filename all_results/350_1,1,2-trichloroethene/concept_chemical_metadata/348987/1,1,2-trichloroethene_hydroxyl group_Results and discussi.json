    "context": "TCM with a higher chlorine content in its molecule causes more deactivation compared to DCM, as it is more reactive and consequently causes more chlorination of the active metal species in Cr1.0Cu0.5/SiCl4-Z. In fact, the H/C ratio of the Cl-VOC is the key factor that determined the life of a combustion catalyst. In a similar way, the initial slower activity decay with TCE compared to that caused by TCM can be attributed to the lower reactivity of the former substance. However, at longer operating times, TCE causes more deactivation as the effect of coke accumulation gains significance.Effects of ageing on surface hydroxyl groups In zeolites, surface hydroxyl groups fall under two major groups viz. bridging hydroxyl belonging to Br\u00f8nsted acid sites and silanols associated with a wide infrared absorption band centered at 3595 and 3735cm\u22121, respectively. Since the infrared absorption spectra for these two types of hydroxyl groups do not show well separated peaks (Fig. 6 ), qualitative comparison between samples is based on the shape of the peaks between 3300 and 3800cm\u22121. Fig. 6 shows that the hydroxyls absorption region is characterized by an almost symmetrical peak between 3300 and 3800cm\u22121. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its reactivity and effects on catalyst deactivation, while hydroxyl groups are mentioned as surface features of zeolites that influence catalytic activity. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship established between TCE and hydroxyl groups, as the discussion focuses more on the properties of TCE and the characteristics of hydroxyl groups separately.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the broader topic of catalytic processes, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance together in the context provided.",
