    "context": "for TCE. Thus, it can be concluded that the catalyst deactivation is mainly attributed to interactions between the catalyst and chlorine bearing in mind that the SiCl4-Z support is highly resistant to hydrogen chloride. Low coking activity with DCM and TCM is ascribed to their small molecules and highly reactive intermediates to give high selectivity to gaseous products. With increasing molecular size in TCE, the coking activity increases but is still low compared to that of non-chlorinated VOCs as reported by D\u00e9g\u00e9 et al. and Antunes et al.. Initial interactions between metallic species and chlorine atoms to form metal chloride cause rapid deactivation of the catalyst as indicated by a steeper drop in the activity. As the reaction time progresses, a more stable activity is obtained suggesting a limited capacity of the metallic species to receive chlorine. By theory, highly stable Cr3+ can only receive three chlorine atoms to form chloride, while it is two atoms with Cu2+. However, with the ability of chromium and copper to present multiple oxidation states, coupled with the ability of molecular chlorine to act as strong oxidizing agent, these interactions become more complicated.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its interactions with chlorine atoms during catalytic processes. The text highlights how the presence of chlorine atoms affects catalyst deactivation and the formation of metal chlorides. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the chemical behavior of TCE rather than a direct interaction with the concept of 'atom' itself, which is a fundamental unit of matter.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as TCE's behavior is discussed in the context of its interactions with chlorine atoms, but there is no detailed exploration of how TCE specifically relates to the broader concept of an atom beyond this interaction.",
