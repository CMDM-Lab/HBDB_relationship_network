    "context": "for TCE. Thus, it can be concluded that the catalyst deactivation is mainly attributed to interactions between the catalyst and chlorine bearing in mind that the SiCl4-Z support is highly resistant to hydrogen chloride. Low coking activity with DCM and TCM is ascribed to their small molecules and highly reactive intermediates to give high selectivity to gaseous products. With increasing molecular size in TCE, the coking activity increases but is still low compared to that of non-chlorinated VOCs as reported by D\u00e9g\u00e9 et al. and Antunes et al.. Initial interactions between metallic species and chlorine atoms to form metal chloride cause rapid deactivation of the catalyst as indicated by a steeper drop in the activity. As the reaction time progresses, a more stable activity is obtained suggesting a limited capacity of the metallic species to receive chlorine. By theory, highly stable Cr3+ can only receive three chlorine atoms to form chloride, while it is two atoms with Cu2+. However, with the ability of chromium and copper to present multiple oxidation states, coupled with the ability of molecular chlorine to act as strong oxidizing agent, these interactions become more complicated.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its interactions with chlorine, particularly in the context of catalyst deactivation. The presence of chlorine, as indicated by the formation of metal chlorides, is crucial in understanding the catalyst's performance and stability during reactions involving TCE. The text highlights how chlorine atoms interact with metallic species, affecting the catalyst's activity, but does not provide a direct functional relationship between TCE and chlorides beyond this interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TCE's interaction with chlorides is discussed in terms of catalyst deactivation, indicating a significant connection. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of how TCE specifically influences chloride behavior or vice versa.",
