    "context": "For example, Sleep and Sykes (1989) reported that at many sites where VOC vapors were present as an immiscible phase, VOC concentrations in the water phase were not consistent with equilibrium concentrations. Hence, it remains unclear how kinetic processes and other factors such as molecular diffusion of VOCs do affect the mass transfer of VOC vapors across air-water interfaces. To address this problem, we performed a series of batch experiments to more closely investigate VOC vapor dissolution and subsequent diffusion into the liquid phase. Specific objectives of our study were to (1) estimate the kinetics of VOC vapor dissolution (TCE and toluene in this study) into a stirred water reservoir, (2) investigate the effect of chemical properties of the water phase such as pH and especially salinity on VOC vapor dissolution in water, (3) evaluate the effect of molecular diffusion in water on VOC mass transfer across the air-water interface, and (4) numerically simulate VOC vapor dissolution and transport within the aqueous phase. Experimental setup and procedure The chemicals used in this study were pure TCE and toluene (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck, respectively), and mercury chloride (HgCl2) of 99.5% purity (Sigma-Aldrich). Fig. 1 shows a schematic of our experimental setup. The system consisted of a glass cylinder (column) of 5.0cm length and 4.0cm internal diameter, together with a very small glass cylinder hanging in the middle of the larger container. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) investigated for their vapor dissolution and diffusion into water. The study aims to understand the kinetics of VOC vapor dissolution, specifically focusing on TCE and toluene, as they are used in the same experimental setup to evaluate their mass transfer across air-water interfaces. However, the relationship is primarily based on their co-investigation rather than a direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are studied together in the context of VOC vapor dissolution. Their relationship is significant in the experimental design, but there is no detailed discussion of their individual interactions or comparative effects.",
