    "context": "Next, 0.5ml mercury chloride of 10mgl\u22121 was added to the water pool to suppress any microorganism activity within the setup, thus eliminating possible biodegradation processes during the experiments. Water inside the column was subsequently mixed thoroughly using a magnetic stirring bar (SCILOGEX PTFE, with pivot ring, 25\u00d77.9mm) and a magnetic stirrer (IKA, Germany) to obtain a homogenous solution of DI water and the mercury chloride. We next introduced 2.0ml of pure phase VOC into the small hanging glass cylinder in the headspace (Fig. 1), after which the top of the column was capped immediately with a vapor-tight stainless steel lid. Several batch experiments were conducted to determine the evaporation rate constants (k e ) of TCE and toluene from the small hanging VOC container into the headspace, and the dissolution rate constant (k d ) describing subsequent dissolution kinetics of the VOC vapors from the headspace into the water phase. For the stirred experiments we used the magnetic stirrer to eliminate any VOC diffusion gradients within the water phase, thus ensuring uniform concentrations within the water reservoir. Precautions were taken not to disturb the air-water interface. We also performed batch experiments without stirring the water phase to evaluate the effect of VOC diffusion within the water phase on mass transfer, and hence the dissolution rate. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being studied for their evaporation and dissolution rate constants in a controlled experimental setup. The experiments aim to understand the mass transfer dynamics of these VOCs in water, indicating a comparative analysis of their behavior in the same environmental conditions. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship between TCE and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same experimental framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are studied together in the same experimental context, but their relationship is not deeply explored or defined beyond their shared characteristics as VOCs.",
