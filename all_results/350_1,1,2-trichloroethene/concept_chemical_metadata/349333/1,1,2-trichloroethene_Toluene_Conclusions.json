    "context": "VOC vapor dissolution in the water phase was found to be independent of pH. However, salinity was found to have an important effect on dissolution, mass transfer rates as well as the solubility of TCE and toluene into water. The maximum concentrations of two compounds, corresponding to their solubilities, decreased by about 30% in seawater as compared to DI water. Henry's law constants of both TCE and toluene hence were also about 30% less in seawater. This shows that salinity can be a limiting factor for VOC mass transfer across air-water interfaces. Results of the stirred water experiments revealed a quick increase in the VOC concentrations with time since molecular diffusion was eliminated as a possible barrier for VOC transfer ways from the air-water interface. Stirring speed had only a small effect on the VOC concentrations in the water phase. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose dissolution in water is influenced by salinity. The study indicates that the solubility of both compounds decreases in seawater compared to deionized water, suggesting a shared behavior in terms of mass transfer and solubility in aquatic environments. However, the specific interactions or comparative effects between TCE and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their solubility characteristics.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are discussed in relation to their solubility and mass transfer in water, indicating a shared characteristic as VOCs. However, there is no detailed interaction or functional relationship provided between the two compounds.",
        "score": 3
