    "context": "Washington (1995) has provided a comprehensive review of the hydrolysis of VOCs and tabulates half lives. Hydrolysis rates are sensitive to pH due to acid/base mediated reaction mechanisms and temperature, both of which could be important in waste disposal settings. Temperature profiles may hence prove important as the relatively high activation energies for most VOC reactions means that half lives may be more than an order of magnitude longer at 10\u00b0C compared to 25\u00b0C. Hydrolysis half-lives of many haloalkanes and halogenated alcohols are <100years, many halomethanes and halogenated aldehydes <1000year and many haloalkenes (e.g., TCE and PCE) and aromatic VOCs (e.g., BTEX and chloro- or dichloro-benzenes) >1000years (Washington, 1995). Considering unsaturated zone travel times, it is hence the <100years half-live grouping that is of any significance. Half-lives less than 10years include chloroethane, 2-chloroethanol, 2-chloropropanol and less than 1years include 1,3-dichloropropene, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and 1,1,1-TCA. Butler and Barker (1996) have also tabulated abiotic hydrolysis (substitution and dehydrohalogenation) half-lives at 10 to 25\u00b0C for CAHs with values around <1years given again for chloroethane, 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and additionally bromomethane, pentachloroethane and bromoethane.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned alongside halogenated alcohols in a discussion about the hydrolysis rates of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Both TCE and halogenated alcohols are categorized as halogenated compounds, and their hydrolysis half-lives are compared. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between TCE and halogenated alcohols beyond their classification and hydrolysis characteristics.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene and halogenated alcohols are grouped together in the context of hydrolysis rates, indicating a shared category but lacking a detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
