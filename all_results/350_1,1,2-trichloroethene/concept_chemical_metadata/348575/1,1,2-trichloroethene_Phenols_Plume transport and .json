    "context": "Aerobic cometabolism may degrade a wide range of higher and lower chlorinated CAHs with degradation to CO2, water and chloride and other products (formate, trichloroethanol and chloroacetaldehyde). CAH aerobic cometabolism may naturally occur where suitable conditions and primary substrate exist, however, there is an absence of relevant studies (Freedman et al., 2001). Most available literature is derived from its use as a remediation technology (Connon et al., 2005; Semprini et al., 2009) and as such provides some information on co-contaminant conditions etc. that may promote natural occurrence. Aromatic substrates (toluene, phenol) have greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes (TCE, DCEs) (Hopkins and McCarty, 1995), whereas gaseous co-metabolic substrates (methane, propane, butane) are generally better suited for the treatment of chlorinated methanes and ethanes (Semprini, 1997; Semprini et al., 2007) with butane often preferred due to its greater carbon content and solubility (Kim et al., 1997). Aerobic cometabolism may be easily overlooked, but potentially occurs in multi-contaminant CAH plumes. Frascari et al. (2006) demonstrated fairly recalcitrant CAHs such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane may degrade aerobically via methane- and propane-utilizing biomasses. They also showed VC may serve as a growth substrate in CAH mixtures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and phenols are mentioned in relation to aerobic cometabolism, where aromatic substrates like phenols are noted for their greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes, including 1,1,2-trichloroethene. This suggests a potential interaction where phenols may enhance the degradation of chlorinated compounds through cometabolic processes, although specific details on their direct relationship are limited.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both terms are connected through the concept of aerobic cometabolism, indicating that phenols can aid in the degradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethene, but the context does not provide extensive details on their interaction.",
