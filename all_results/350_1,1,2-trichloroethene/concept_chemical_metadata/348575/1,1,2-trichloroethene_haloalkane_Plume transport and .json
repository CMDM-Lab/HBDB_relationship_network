    "context": "Washington (1995) has provided a comprehensive review of the hydrolysis of VOCs and tabulates half lives. Hydrolysis rates are sensitive to pH due to acid/base mediated reaction mechanisms and temperature, both of which could be important in waste disposal settings. Temperature profiles may hence prove important as the relatively high activation energies for most VOC reactions means that half lives may be more than an order of magnitude longer at 10\u00b0C compared to 25\u00b0C. Hydrolysis half-lives of many haloalkanes and halogenated alcohols are <100years, many halomethanes and halogenated aldehydes <1000year and many haloalkenes (e.g., TCE and PCE) and aromatic VOCs (e.g., BTEX and chloro- or dichloro-benzenes) >1000years (Washington, 1995). Considering unsaturated zone travel times, it is hence the <100years half-live grouping that is of any significance. Half-lives less than 10years include chloroethane, 2-chloroethanol, 2-chloropropanol and less than 1years include 1,3-dichloropropene, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and 1,1,1-TCA. Butler and Barker (1996) have also tabulated abiotic hydrolysis (substitution and dehydrohalogenation) half-lives at 10 to 25\u00b0C for CAHs with values around <1years given again for chloroethane, 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and additionally bromomethane, pentachloroethane and bromoethane.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a specific example of a volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of haloalkanes. The discussion focuses on the hydrolysis rates and half-lives of various haloalkanes, including 1,1,2-trichloroethene, indicating that it shares chemical properties and environmental behavior with other haloalkanes. However, the relationship is primarily categorical rather than indicating any specific interaction or functional significance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is classified as a haloalkane, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or implications beyond this classification.",
        "score": 2
