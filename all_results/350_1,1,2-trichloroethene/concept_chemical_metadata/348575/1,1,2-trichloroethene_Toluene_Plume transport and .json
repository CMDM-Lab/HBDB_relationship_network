    "context": "Aerobic cometabolism may degrade a wide range of higher and lower chlorinated CAHs with degradation to CO2, water and chloride and other products (formate, trichloroethanol and chloroacetaldehyde). CAH aerobic cometabolism may naturally occur where suitable conditions and primary substrate exist, however, there is an absence of relevant studies (Freedman et al., 2001). Most available literature is derived from its use as a remediation technology (Connon et al., 2005; Semprini et al., 2009) and as such provides some information on co-contaminant conditions etc. that may promote natural occurrence. Aromatic substrates (toluene, phenol) have greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes (TCE, DCEs) (Hopkins and McCarty, 1995), whereas gaseous co-metabolic substrates (methane, propane, butane) are generally better suited for the treatment of chlorinated methanes and ethanes (Semprini, 1997; Semprini et al., 2007) with butane often preferred due to its greater carbon content and solubility (Kim et al., 1997). Aerobic cometabolism may be easily overlooked, but potentially occurs in multi-contaminant CAH plumes. Frascari et al. (2006) demonstrated fairly recalcitrant CAHs such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane may degrade aerobically via methane- and propane-utilizing biomasses. They also showed VC may serve as a growth substrate in CAH mixtures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene are discussed in relation to their roles as substrates in aerobic cometabolism for the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs). Toluene, as an aromatic substrate, is noted for its greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes compared to other substrates, indicating a significant interaction in the context of bioremediation processes. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene is not deeply explored beyond their roles in the degradation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are involved in the same bioremediation context, with toluene enhancing the degradation of chlorinated ethenes like 1,1,2-trichloroethene. However, the details of their interaction are not extensively discussed.",
