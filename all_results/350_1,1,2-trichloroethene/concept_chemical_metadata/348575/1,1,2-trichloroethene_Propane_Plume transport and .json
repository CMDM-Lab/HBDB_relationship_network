    "context": "Aerobic cometabolism may degrade a wide range of higher and lower chlorinated CAHs with degradation to CO2, water and chloride and other products (formate, trichloroethanol and chloroacetaldehyde). CAH aerobic cometabolism may naturally occur where suitable conditions and primary substrate exist, however, there is an absence of relevant studies (Freedman et al., 2001). Most available literature is derived from its use as a remediation technology (Connon et al., 2005; Semprini et al., 2009) and as such provides some information on co-contaminant conditions etc. that may promote natural occurrence. Aromatic substrates (toluene, phenol) have greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes (TCE, DCEs) (Hopkins and McCarty, 1995), whereas gaseous co-metabolic substrates (methane, propane, butane) are generally better suited for the treatment of chlorinated methanes and ethanes (Semprini, 1997; Semprini et al., 2007) with butane often preferred due to its greater carbon content and solubility (Kim et al., 1997). Aerobic cometabolism may be easily overlooked, but potentially occurs in multi-contaminant CAH plumes. Frascari et al. (2006) demonstrated fairly recalcitrant CAHs such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane may degrade aerobically via methane- and propane-utilizing biomasses. They also showed VC may serve as a growth substrate in CAH mixtures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and propane are related through the process of aerobic cometabolism, where propane serves as a gaseous co-metabolic substrate that enhances the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) like 1,1,2-trichloroethene. The literature suggests that propane is effective in treating chlorinated methanes and ethanes, indicating a functional relationship in bioremediation processes involving these compounds. However, the specific interaction between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and propane is not deeply explored, focusing instead on broader degradation mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as propane is mentioned as a co-metabolic substrate that aids in the degradation of chlorinated compounds like 1,1,2-trichloroethene. While there is a clear connection in the context of bioremediation, the details of their interaction are not extensively discussed.",
