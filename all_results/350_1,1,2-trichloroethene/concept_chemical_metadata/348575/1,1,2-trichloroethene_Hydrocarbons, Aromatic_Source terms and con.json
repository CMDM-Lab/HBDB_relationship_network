    "context": "For example, Health Canada classes VOCs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of 50 to 250\u00b0C with emphasis placed upon commonly encountered VOCs impacting air quality. The European Union also defines VOCs to have a boiling point <250\u00b0C. Alternatively, VOCs (or specific subsets) may be defined in the various laws and guidance under which they are regulated, for example, the US Safe Drinking Water Act includes a specific VOC listing. VOCs include some oxygenated compounds, for example ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons (ArHs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) comprising chlorinated alkenes/alkanes such as carbon tetrachloride (CT), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). Lesser chlorinated CAHs may often represent degradation products, e.g., vinyl chloride (VC), cis-dichloroethene (cDCE). The hydrocarbons are often LNAPLs and CAHs are often DNAPLs. Both ArHs and CAHs have received much research attention (Kueper et al., 2003; Rivett and Thornton, 2008; Wiedemeier et al., 1999). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is classified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) alongside aromatic hydrocarbons, which include compounds like benzene and toluene. Both categories are discussed in relation to their boiling points and environmental impact, indicating that while 1,1,2-trichloroethene is not an aromatic hydrocarbon itself, it is grouped with them under the broader classification of VOCs that affect air quality. The relationship is primarily categorical rather than functional or interactive.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned alongside aromatic hydrocarbons within the context of VOCs. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
