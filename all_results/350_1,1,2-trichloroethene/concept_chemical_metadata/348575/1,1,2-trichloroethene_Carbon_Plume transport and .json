    "context": "Aerobic cometabolism may degrade a wide range of higher and lower chlorinated CAHs with degradation to CO2, water and chloride and other products (formate, trichloroethanol and chloroacetaldehyde). CAH aerobic cometabolism may naturally occur where suitable conditions and primary substrate exist, however, there is an absence of relevant studies (Freedman et al., 2001). Most available literature is derived from its use as a remediation technology (Connon et al., 2005; Semprini et al., 2009) and as such provides some information on co-contaminant conditions etc. that may promote natural occurrence. Aromatic substrates (toluene, phenol) have greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes (TCE, DCEs) (Hopkins and McCarty, 1995), whereas gaseous co-metabolic substrates (methane, propane, butane) are generally better suited for the treatment of chlorinated methanes and ethanes (Semprini, 1997; Semprini et al., 2007) with butane often preferred due to its greater carbon content and solubility (Kim et al., 1997). Aerobic cometabolism may be easily overlooked, but potentially occurs in multi-contaminant CAH plumes. Frascari et al. (2006) demonstrated fairly recalcitrant CAHs such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane may degrade aerobically via methane- and propane-utilizing biomasses. They also showed VC may serve as a growth substrate in CAH mixtures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is discussed in relation to aerobic cometabolism, which involves the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and other products. Carbon is indirectly referenced as a product of this degradation process, highlighting its role in the overall metabolic pathway. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the degradation process rather than a direct interaction between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon, as they are part of the same degradation process. However, there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship, making it a general association rather than a significant interaction.",
