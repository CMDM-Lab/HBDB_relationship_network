    "context": "For example, Health Canada classes VOCs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of 50 to 250\u00b0C with emphasis placed upon commonly encountered VOCs impacting air quality. The European Union also defines VOCs to have a boiling point <250\u00b0C. Alternatively, VOCs (or specific subsets) may be defined in the various laws and guidance under which they are regulated, for example, the US Safe Drinking Water Act includes a specific VOC listing. VOCs include some oxygenated compounds, for example ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons (ArHs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) comprising chlorinated alkenes/alkanes such as carbon tetrachloride (CT), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). Lesser chlorinated CAHs may often represent degradation products, e.g., vinyl chloride (VC), cis-dichloroethene (cDCE). The hydrocarbons are often LNAPLs and CAHs are often DNAPLs. Both ArHs and CAHs have received much research attention (Kueper et al., 2003; Rivett and Thornton, 2008; Wiedemeier et al., 1999). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are regulated due to their impact on air quality. They are mentioned alongside other VOCs, such as benzene and ethylbenzene, indicating they share a common category as organic compounds with specific boiling point ranges. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs impacting air quality, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed in the context.",
