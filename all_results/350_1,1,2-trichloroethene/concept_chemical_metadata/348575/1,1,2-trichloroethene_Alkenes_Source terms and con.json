    "context": "For example, Health Canada classes VOCs as organic compounds that have boiling points roughly in the range of 50 to 250\u00b0C with emphasis placed upon commonly encountered VOCs impacting air quality. The European Union also defines VOCs to have a boiling point <250\u00b0C. Alternatively, VOCs (or specific subsets) may be defined in the various laws and guidance under which they are regulated, for example, the US Safe Drinking Water Act includes a specific VOC listing. VOCs include some oxygenated compounds, for example ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons (ArHs) such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) comprising chlorinated alkenes/alkanes such as carbon tetrachloride (CT), 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). Lesser chlorinated CAHs may often represent degradation products, e.g., vinyl chloride (VC), cis-dichloroethene (cDCE). The hydrocarbons are often LNAPLs and CAHs are often DNAPLs. Both ArHs and CAHs have received much research attention (Kueper et al., 2003; Rivett and Thornton, 2008; Wiedemeier et al., 1999). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is classified as a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon (CAH), which falls under the broader category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Alkenes, as a class of hydrocarbons characterized by at least one carbon-carbon double bond, are mentioned in relation to chlorinated compounds. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and alkenes is not elaborated upon, indicating a general categorization rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are part of the broader classification of organic compounds, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relevance within the context provided.",
