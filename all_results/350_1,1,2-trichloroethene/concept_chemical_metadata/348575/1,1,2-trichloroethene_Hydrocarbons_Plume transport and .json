    "context": "The V\u00e6rl\u00f8se airbase field study involving an emplaced NAPL source of 13 volatile hydrocarbons (BTX aromatics, alkanes, CFC-113 tracer) by Christophersen et al. (2005) has likewise involved significant supporting work on NAPL ageing (Broholm et al., 2005), microbial community (Kaufmann et al., 2004), isotope shifts (Bouchard et al., 2008), transport modelling (Gaganis et al., 2004) and comparison of laboratory and field biodegradation rates (H\u00f6hener et al., 2006). Data collected over 1year from the V\u00e6rl\u00f8se site (Christophersen et al., 2005) confirmed diffusive migration of hydrocarbon vapours was attenuated by sorption and aerobic biodegradation with concentration declines of 3\u20134 orders of magnitude to low concentrations (<0.01mgl\u22121 in air) within <10m radial distance. The 10l NAPL source was positioned just 2m above the water table, but lead to minimal groundwater contamination from vapour contact (direct source infiltration was prevented). The setup and depths to water table are not dissimilar to those used in the Borden emplaced TCE source of Conant et al. (1996) that in contrast lead to significant groundwater contamination (Rivett, 1995) and infers the importance of ready biodegradation and attenuation of hydrocarbons relative to CAHs. Where loadings of hydrocarbons or other biodegradable organic matter/contaminant (electron donor) are high, then anaerobic conditions may develop in the unsaturated zone. For example, the crude oil pipeline spill at the Bimidji site, although with a LNAPL source zone predominantly at the water table, nonetheless demonstrated the importance of both aerobic and anaerobic degradation in the unsaturated zone (Molins, et al., 2010 and citations therein). Reductive dissolution of both manganse and iron oxides (Anderson et al., 1998) and progressive depletion of Fe(III) and Mn(IV) within the oil body and smear zone resulted in methanogenesis becoming dominant and CH4 and CO2 in the gas phase.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned alongside hydrocarbons as part of a study examining the biodegradation and transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the environment. While TCE is a chlorinated solvent, hydrocarbons refer to a broader category of organic compounds. The relationship is indirect, as both are involved in environmental contamination and degradation processes, but no specific interaction or comparison between TCE and hydrocarbons is detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and hydrocarbons, as they are both discussed in the context of environmental studies on VOCs. However, their relationship lacks detailed exploration or direct interaction.",
