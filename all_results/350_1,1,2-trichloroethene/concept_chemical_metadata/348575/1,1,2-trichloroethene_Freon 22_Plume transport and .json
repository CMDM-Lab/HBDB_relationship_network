    "context": "The RVDs decrease rapidly with vapour dilution in air and vapour pressure of the VOC declines, so density effects are generally limited to the near proximity of NAPL sources in the vadose zone. Numerical model sensitivity analysis by Mendoza and Frind (1990b) indicated density-induced vapour advection was dominant for a 80mday\u22121 hydraulic conductivity (1\u00d710\u221210 m2 permeability) (coarse sands \u2014 gravels), but diffusion was found to be dominant by reducing the conductivity by only one order of magnitude to 8mday\u22121 (medium to coarse sand). Density-driven advection decreased with declining source strength with a RVD of 1.1 only weakly advective in the 80mday\u22121 scenario. Johnson et al. (1992) compared emplaced Freon-22 and TCE NAPL sources and found significant density-induced migration in the LEAP tank artificial pea-gravel aquifer, but diffusion was dominant in the artificial sand aquifer. Jang and Aral (2007) also modelled sensitivity to hydraulic conductivity over a factor of two ranges (42\u201385mday\u22121) for a shallow TCE NAPL source in an 8m thick unsaturated zone. Density-driven advection dominated at these relatively high permeability values (agreeing with Mendoza and Frind (1990b)), causing accelerated contamination of groundwater local to the source. Although greater permeability favoured a more rapid depletion of the source, Jang and Aral note the down side was the greater groundwater contamination predicted. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and Freon 22 are both mentioned as non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) sources in a study comparing their density-induced migration in different aquifer types. The research indicates that while both compounds can influence groundwater contamination, the specific interactions or comparative effects between TCE and Freon 22 are not elaborated upon, focusing instead on their individual behaviors in the context of vapor advection and diffusion.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in relation to their environmental impact on groundwater but lack a direct interaction or detailed comparative analysis within the context.",
