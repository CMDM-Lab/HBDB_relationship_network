    "context": "Washington (1995) has provided a comprehensive review of the hydrolysis of VOCs and tabulates half lives. Hydrolysis rates are sensitive to pH due to acid/base mediated reaction mechanisms and temperature, both of which could be important in waste disposal settings. Temperature profiles may hence prove important as the relatively high activation energies for most VOC reactions means that half lives may be more than an order of magnitude longer at 10\u00b0C compared to 25\u00b0C. Hydrolysis half-lives of many haloalkanes and halogenated alcohols are <100years, many halomethanes and halogenated aldehydes <1000year and many haloalkenes (e.g., TCE and PCE) and aromatic VOCs (e.g., BTEX and chloro- or dichloro-benzenes) >1000years (Washington, 1995). Considering unsaturated zone travel times, it is hence the <100years half-live grouping that is of any significance. Half-lives less than 10years include chloroethane, 2-chloroethanol, 2-chloropropanol and less than 1years include 1,3-dichloropropene, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and 1,1,1-TCA. Butler and Barker (1996) have also tabulated abiotic hydrolysis (substitution and dehydrohalogenation) half-lives at 10 to 25\u00b0C for CAHs with values around <1years given again for chloroethane, 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and additionally bromomethane, pentachloroethane and bromoethane.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a specific example of a haloalkene, which is a broader category of compounds that includes various halogenated alkenes. The discussion focuses on the hydrolysis rates and half-lives of different haloalkenes and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), indicating that 1,1,2-trichloroethene falls within the same chemical family as haloalkenes. However, the relationship is primarily categorical without detailed interaction or functional significance provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is classified under haloalkenes, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or unique properties beyond this classification.",
