Air pollution by chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOC) negatively affects human health and the environment. Volatile organic compounds such as trichloroethylene (C2HCl3) and carbon tetra-chloride (CCl4) are widely used as industrial solvents due to their low flammability, high evaporation rate and low reactivity. Moreover, VOCs can efficiently dissolve a wide range of organic substances; thus, they are often used as degreasers and in the dry-cleaning process. The toxicity of these compounds has promoted the development of a variety of technologies for the destruction of VOCs. Besides thermal incineration, catalytic technologies such as catalytic and photocatalytic destruction, catalytic hydrodechlorination, catalytic steam reformation and catalytic combustion have been employed.
