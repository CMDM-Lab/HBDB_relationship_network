    "context": "The results revealed that the residue contained CuCl and CuCl2\u00b72H2O. In addition HCl was not observed, which suggests that virtually all of the chlorine produced in the plasma reacts with copper to form the aforementioned compounds. GC/MS analyses revealed that byproducts including CO2  , NO and N2O were present in the reactor outlet gas. The formation of CO2 is the main pathway for the loss of atomic carbon from fragmented CCl4 and C2HCl3. In fact, the output concentration of CO2 increased linearly with an increase in the concentration of VOC introduced into the plasma. Moreover, upon identification of CO2 in the output gas, an accurate carbon balance was obtained. The formation of NO and N2O is the result of the recombination of high temperature gas in the chamber (ca. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned in relation to the byproducts formed during a chemical reaction involving VOCs in a plasma reactor. However, the term 'Atom' appears to refer to atomic carbon, which is discussed in the context of carbon loss during the reaction. There is no direct relationship established between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and atomic carbon, as the focus is on the byproducts and their formation rather than a specific interaction between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Atom. They are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
