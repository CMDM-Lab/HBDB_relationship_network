    "context": "The results revealed that the residue contained CuCl and CuCl2\u00b72H2O. In addition HCl was not observed, which suggests that virtually all of the chlorine produced in the plasma reacts with copper to form the aforementioned compounds. GC/MS analyses revealed that byproducts including CO2  , NO and N2O were present in the reactor outlet gas. The formation of CO2 is the main pathway for the loss of atomic carbon from fragmented CCl4 and C2HCl3. In fact, the output concentration of CO2 increased linearly with an increase in the concentration of VOC introduced into the plasma. Moreover, upon identification of CO2 in the output gas, an accurate carbon balance was obtained. The formation of NO and N2O is the result of the recombination of high temperature gas in the chamber (ca. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is indirectly related to carbon through the byproducts formed during its degradation in a plasma reactor. The analysis indicates that the breakdown of chlorinated compounds leads to the production of CO2, which represents a loss of atomic carbon. The output concentration of CO2 correlates with the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) introduced, suggesting a relationship between the degradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon release in the form of CO2.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the degradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethene and its contribution to carbon loss through CO2 formation, indicating a significant interaction but lacking detailed exploration of their relationship.",
