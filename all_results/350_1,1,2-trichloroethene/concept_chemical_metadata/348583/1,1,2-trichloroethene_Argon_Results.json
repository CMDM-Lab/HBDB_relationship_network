    "context": "With an internal diameter of 1.4mm, the optimal velocity was 4.5L/min; however, an increase in energy efficiency can be achieved by increasing the flow rate, although this leads to a decrease in the percent destruction. High flow rates and initial concentrations provided energy efficiency values greater than 1000g/kWh. Assuming that electricity costs sh.10/kWh, it costs sh.1/kg of VOC residue to operate the proposed plasma torch system at the aforementioned efficiency rate, which is significantly less than other devices developed for the destruction of VOCs. Ko et al. obtained an operating cost of approximately /kg for the destruction of C2HCl3 with a microwave argon plasma torch. Moreover, a report by Agnihotri et al. estimated that the cost of a non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma with a humid air stream (88% relative humidity) was approximately /kg-trichloroethane. 3.1.4 Effect of the contaminant concentration The lowermost graph in Fig. 6 displays the output concentration of C2HCl3 and CCl4 as a function of the initial concentration of contaminant at six different applied microwave powers, from 100 to 1000W. At an applied power less than 300W, high concentrations of C2HCl3 or CCl4 could not be used in the inlet gas because the plasma was unstable. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be destroyed using a plasma torch system, which utilizes argon as a working gas. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the operational aspects of the plasma system rather than a direct chemical interaction between the two substances. Argon serves as a medium for the plasma process, but no specific biochemical or physiological relevance is discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the same process of VOC destruction using plasma technology. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or significant interaction, making it more about their co-occurrence in the context rather than a strong functional link.",
