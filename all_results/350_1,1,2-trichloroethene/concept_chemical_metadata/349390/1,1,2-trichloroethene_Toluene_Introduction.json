    "context": "However, VPRBs are not suitable for the unsaturated zone because of generally limited horizontal flow in the unsaturated zone. Horizontal permeable reactive barriers (HPRBs), on the other hand, can be employed in the unsaturated zone to prevent or limit the vertical leaching of contaminants (Siegrist et\u00a0al., 1998; Mackova et\u00a0al., 2006; Leal et\u00a0al., 2013) or the upward migration of contaminant vapors. The potential of dry solid potassium permanganate granules for oxidizing various VOCs has been reported in the literature (Mahmoodlu et\u00a0al., 2013, 2014b). The oxidation of TCE, toluene, and ethanol is described by the following overall reaction equations: (1) C 2 H C l 3 ( g ) + 2 K M n O 4 ( s ) \u2192 2 K + + 2 M n O 2 ( s ) + 3 C l \u2212 + 2 C O 2 ( g ) + H + (2) C 6 H 5 C H 3 ( g ) + 12 KMn O 4 ( s ) + 2 H 2 O \u2192 12 K + + 12 O H \u2212 + 12 Mn O 2 ( s ) + 7 C O 2 ( g ) (3) C 2 H 5 O H ( g ) + 4 KMn O 4 ( s ) \u2192 4 K + + 4 O H \u2212 + 4 Mn O 2 ( s ) + 2 C O 2 ( g ) + H 2 O Our recent study of VOC vapor diffusion through a partially-saturated permeable reactive barrier showed that water saturation has a considerable effect on the removal capacity of a HPRB (Mahmoodlu et\u00a0al., 2014b). The study also found that changes in pH values generated during the VOC oxidations according to their stoichiometric reactions (Eqs. (1)\u2013(3)) are responsible for reducing the oxidation rates of the VOCs. Although that study showed that the prevailing chemical processes and water saturation strongly affected the reactivity and longevity of a HPRB, it remained unclear how HPRB thickness, its location relative to the water table, and water availability in general would affect the oxidation process, and consequently the reactivity and longevity of the HPRB in the unsaturated zone.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be oxidized by potassium permanganate in permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) to mitigate contamination. However, the relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same chemical reactions for oxidation, without any detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the context of the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are part of the same oxidation reactions but lack a direct functional or chemical relationship beyond their classification as VOCs being treated in similar contexts.",
