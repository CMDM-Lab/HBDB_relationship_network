    "context": "Indeed, preliminary simulations based on our two alternative hypotheses (e.g., assuming manganese dioxide and consequent coating of the reactive surface of potassium permanganate, or depletion of potassium permanganate mass and consequently reduction of its concentration in the water phase) could not describe the experimental data. The model in this case accurately described the observed breakthrough curves of TCE and toluene vapors in the headspace. Modeling results confirmed the controlling effect of pH on the oxidation rate of TCE and toluene by potassium permanganate (Fig.\u00a02). While the oxidation rate was negligible at relatively long times, with the concentrations of TCE and toluene in the headspace reaching the corresponding concentrations of the control experiments, the oxidation rate for the ethanol experiment decreased only slightly and remained constant during the experiment due to produced water (Fig.\u00a02). 4.2.3 Distribution of VOC concentrations for the HPRB placed 7.0\u00a0cm above the water table Fig.\u00a03 compares the simulated VOC concentrations in the headspace with our experimental data when the partially-saturated HPRB (S w \u00a0=\u00a00.2) was placed 7.0\u00a0cm above the water table, while again also including the control experiments. The lower plots in this figure provide close-ups of the reactive transport data in the upper plots. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose oxidation rates were modeled in relation to potassium permanganate. The study highlights the controlling effect of pH on the oxidation rates of both compounds, indicating a shared chemical behavior in the experimental setup. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between TCE and toluene are not deeply explored beyond their inclusion in the modeling of oxidation rates.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both TCE and toluene are discussed in the context of their oxidation rates by potassium permanganate, indicating a shared chemical process. However, the lack of detailed interaction or comparative analysis limits the strength of their relationship.",
