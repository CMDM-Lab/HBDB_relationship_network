    "context": "For the second experiment we used 80\u00a0g of each, so that the layer thickness was 8.0\u00a0cm. We also carried out a series of control experiments without potassium permanganate for all target compounds. All experiments were conducted in duplicate in a fume cabinet at room temperature (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b0C). We assumed that the temperature and pressure inside the columns remained constant and were equal to room temperature and atmospheric pressure, respectively.VOC transport experiments The VOC transport experiments started by switching the column inflow from DI water to one of the stock solutions containing dissolved concentrations of 130\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121, 50\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121, and 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121 for TCE, toluene, and ethanol, respectively. We measured the concentration of dissolved VOC in the stock solutions and also at the inlet and outlet ports during the experiments. Aqueous samples of 1.5\u00a0ml were taken periodically for this purpose using 2.5-ml gas-tight syringes. Gas samples of 1.5\u00a0ml were taken systematically from the headspace of both the reactive columns (containing HPRB) and the control columns using gas-tight syringes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in transport experiments. The study focuses on measuring the concentrations of these compounds in stock solutions and their behavior in reactive and control columns. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the experiments, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are part of the same experimental setup involving VOC transport, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene.",
