    "context": "The experiments involved only a limited amount of potassium permanganate, which could become depleted due to oxidation of the VOCs. Nevertheless, our experimental data showed that the availability of potassium permanganate was not a limiting factor during the experiments since a significant amount of potassium permanganate remained unconsumed at the end of each experiment. We hence considered the second hypothesis that the VOC oxidation rates depended upon pH. Our earlier study suggested that a decrease in pH during the TCE experiments, and an increase in pH during the toluene and ethanol experiments, as expressed by their stoichiometric reactions in Eqs. (1)\u2013(3), were responsible for the decrease in oxidation rate (Mahmoodlu et\u00a0al., 2014a). This effect was simulated by allowing  k A o x i d to depend on pH as described below. For TCE we used the following equations: (12) k T C E o x i d = \u03b3 T C E ( p H \u2212 \u03c9 T C E ) \u03b2 T C E for pH < 4 with  p H = \u2212 log C H + . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in oxidation experiments with potassium permanganate. The study indicates that the oxidation rates of these compounds are influenced by pH levels, with specific equations provided for TCE. However, the relationship between TCE and toluene is not directly explored beyond their shared involvement in the oxidation process, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene, as both are mentioned in the context of oxidation experiments. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or specific interactions, limiting the relevance.",
