    "context": "The build-up of VOC concentrations in the headspace was much slower for the columns with a thicker HPRB. The increased exposure time to more potassium permanganate within the thicker HPRB, and also the non-uniform change in pH during upward diffusion of the VOCs, clearly did lead to higher efficiency and longevity of the HPRB. A reactive transport model that included diffusion of VOCs in the gas and water phases, dissolution of VOCs from gas into the soil water, and oxidation of dissolved VOCs by dissolved potassium permanganate could satisfactorily simulate the experimental data. For the TCE and toluene experiments with the HPRB placed 12.0\u00a0cm above the water table, we needed to include the effect of pH changes on the oxidation rate in order accurately describe the data. However, the simulations for ethanol vapor transport were conducted without the effect of pH since the production of water due to the oxidation process prevented major change in pH. Simulations of all cases when the HPRB was placed 7.0\u00a0cm above the water table did not require us to account for any changes in pH. This could be explained by diffusion of protons or/and hydroxide ions away from the HPRB, especially downwards to the higher water saturation area. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in experiments assessing their transport and oxidation in a reactive transport model. The study focuses on the efficiency of a thicker HPRB in oxidizing these VOCs, indicating a shared relevance in the context of environmental chemistry and remediation processes. However, the specific interactions or comparative analysis between TCE and toluene are not detailed, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between TCE and toluene, as both are mentioned in the context of VOC transport and oxidation. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or direct interaction, making it a general association rather than a significant one.",
