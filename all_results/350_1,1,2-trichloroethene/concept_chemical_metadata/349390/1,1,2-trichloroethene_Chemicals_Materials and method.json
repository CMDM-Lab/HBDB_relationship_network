    "context": "The third domain was the HPRB within the unsaturated zone consisting of a mixture of potassium permanganate and sand. The fourth domain was the headspace above the unsaturated zone. For the control experiments we used the same setup, but without any potassium permanganate in HPRB.Contaminants and porous medium The target contaminants used in this study were TCE, toluene, and ethanol (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Merck, and ACROS, respectively). Stock solutions of aqueous-phase TCE, ethanol, and toluene were individually prepared in 10-L glass vessels (Fisherbrand) by dissolving the chemicals in degassed-deionized water (Table\u00a01 ). The vessels containing the stock solutions were continuously mixed using magnetic stirrers (IKA, Germany) to maintain homogeneous solutions. The sand used for the column experiments originated from a river bed in Papendrecht (Filtersand, Filcom, The Netherlands) and was sieved to restrict the particle size between 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0mm. Selected properties of the sand are given in Table\u00a01. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as one of the target contaminants in a study involving various chemicals, including toluene and ethanol. The relationship is primarily that TCE is categorized as a chemical contaminant being studied, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance compared to other chemicals mentioned. Thus, it is part of a broader group of chemicals being analyzed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is simply listed among other chemicals without any specific interaction or detailed relationship discussed in the context. They share a general category but lack a direct connection.",
