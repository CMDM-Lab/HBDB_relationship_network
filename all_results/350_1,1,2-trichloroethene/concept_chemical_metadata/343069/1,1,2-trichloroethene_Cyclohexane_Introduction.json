    "context": "It was shown that this technique is appropriate for a wide polarity range of organic compounds since high selectivity can be achieved due to applying different organic solvents as acceptor phase; such as cyclohexane for more unpolar compounds like PCBs, and ethyl acetate for more polar compounds like phenols and chlorophenols [18\u201322]. In LVI the solvent is removed through the open split valve and the analytes are trapped in the liner. If the boiling points of the analytes and the solvent are similar, losses of the analytes occur, since they are removed with the solvent through the open split valve. For volatile compound such as chloroform (boiling point: 61\u00b0C), trichloroethylene (boiling point: 74\u00b0C) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (boiling point: 87\u00b0C) large volume injection is not suitable in combination with an organic solvent compatible with MASE and also with GC\u2013MS (like cyclopentane or cyclohexane). The aim of the work was to develop a new model of MASE combined with a conventional split/splitless injector in order to analyze VOCs in aqueous samples. Therefore, smaller membrane bags (2cm long, wall thickness: 0.03mm, internal diameter: 6mm) were produced and filled with 100\u03bcl of an organic solvent. One microlitre of the organic extract were then injected into a conventional split/splitless injector of a GC-ECD system. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and cyclohexane are mentioned as part of a discussion on the use of organic solvents in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Cyclohexane is highlighted as a suitable solvent for unpolar compounds, while 1,1,2-trichloroethene is referenced in relation to its boiling point and compatibility with large volume injection techniques. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship established between the two compounds beyond their roles as solvents in analytical chemistry.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in the context of solvent selection for VOC analysis, but their relationship is not detailed or significant beyond their categorization as solvents.",
