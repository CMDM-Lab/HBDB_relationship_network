    "context": "Groundwater inorganic quality data (Ford and Tellam, 1994) show increasing acidity with time, generally high nitrate and barium and localised high metals and ammonia. In terms of VOC groundwater quality, Rivett et al. (1990) identified chlorinated solvents, in particular TCE, to be the main VOCs of concern. Industrial sources of TCE and to a lesser extent 1,1,1-TCA have abounded in Birmingham within metal-cleaning applications with more limited use of PCE in textile dry-cleaning. Recent aquifer-survey data (Rivett et al., 2005; Shepherd et al., 2006) confirm a continued dominance of TCE and other chlorinated VOCs with only limited occurrence of aromatic hydrocarbon VOCs and fuel oxygenates. Our informal contact with environmental consultants operating across Birmingham suggests that many industrial sites contain locally high concentrations of VOCs in on-site soils and groundwaters; such data are unpublished. Riverbed piezometer monitoring network Field data were primarily obtained from a network of drivepoint riverbed piezometers. This method was preferred over passive diffusion samplers and seepage flux devices as it was: able to address all the study objectives; relatively rapid to install; inexpensive; not prone to vandalism and flood damage; robust enough to penetrate to \u223c2\u00a0m below riverbed.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a chlorinated solvent of concern in groundwater quality, while aromatic hydrocarbons are mentioned as having limited occurrence in comparison. The focus is primarily on TCE and other chlorinated VOCs, indicating that while both terms relate to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their significance and prevalence in the studied environment differ, with TCE being more prominent than aromatic hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and aromatic hydrocarbons, as both are categorized under VOCs. However, the context does not provide a detailed relationship or interaction between them, merely noting their presence in groundwater quality assessments.",
