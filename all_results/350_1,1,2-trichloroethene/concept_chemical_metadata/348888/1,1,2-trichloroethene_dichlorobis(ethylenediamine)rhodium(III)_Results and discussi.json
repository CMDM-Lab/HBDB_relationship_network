    "context": "Mean travel times through a 1-m thick hyporheic zone were hence predicted to be around 12\u00a0d and thus a degradation half life should be of this order and lower for attenuation reactions to assume significance in the hyporheic zone. Longer half lives would cause only the localised zones of high f oc or low K to offer scope for significant natural attenuation occurrence. Chlorinated VOC degradation products were widely detected in the riverbed. These VOCs may be subdivided (Fig. 3) into: (i) parent compounds likely used by the predominant (mainly engineering) industry present (PCE, TCE, 1,1,1-TCA, TCM) and (ii) daughter compounds less likely used by the local industry and ascribed to parent (bio)degradation (cDCE, tDCE, 1,1-DCE, 1,1-DCA). Although parent compounds were clearly able to reach the riverbed suggesting attenuation in the aquifer beforehand was limited, occurrence of degradation products such as cDCE was significant. cDCE is rarely used by industry, but is the predominant isomer formed by anaerobic dechlorination of TCE under sulphate-reducing or methanogenic conditions (de Bruin et al., 1992; Semprini et al., 1995). cDCE:tDCE ratios >30 are also deemed to be supportive of a degradation route (Wiedemeier et al., 1999) and encountered in 90% of survey cDCE detections.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a chlorinated volatile organic compound (VOC) that undergoes degradation in the hyporheic zone, while dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) is not directly referenced or discussed in relation to TCE. The focus is on the degradation products of TCE and their environmental implications, with no clear connection to dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) established.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) in the context provided. They are mentioned separately without any direct interaction or relevance.",
