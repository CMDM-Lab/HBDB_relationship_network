    "context": "Fig. 2s (Supplementary Material) depicts normalized concentrations (C w /S w ) of TCE and toluene as a function of time for various pH values (2, 7, and 12) of the water reservoir. Results show that dissolution of VOC vapors into water is essentially independent of pH. Hence, pH cannot be a limiting factor for the dissolution kinetics of these two VOCs. However, we note that the literature shows that the solubility of the chlorinated solvents (e.g., TCE) is considerably increased by biosurfactants at pH values less than 7 (Albino and Nambi, 2009).Approximate kinetic analysis of the stirred experiments We first analyzed the data using the approximate decoupled analytical solution (referred to as AD) given by Eqs. (5a) and (5b) to estimate the dissolution (k d ) rate coefficient of the two VOCs. Fig. 6 shows plots of ln[( C max w \u2212 C w )/ C max w ] vs. time for both TCE and toluene dissolution into water, consistent with Eq. (5b). Results confirm that dissolution followed a first-order rate process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its dissolution kinetics in water, particularly influenced by pH and biosurfactants. However, there is no mention or connection to albinism, which is a genetic condition characterized by a lack of melanin. The two terms appear in the same context but are unrelated in terms of chemical or biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a complete lack of relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and albinism, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
