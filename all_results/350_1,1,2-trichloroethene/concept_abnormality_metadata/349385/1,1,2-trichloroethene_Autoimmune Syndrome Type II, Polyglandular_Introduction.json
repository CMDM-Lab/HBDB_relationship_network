    "context": "This study focuses particularly on the stream zone at the border of the contaminant plume, where degradation reactions are able to control the evolution of the plume, as observed by Wilson et al. (2004). Each microbial community has different characteristics and is formed through the interaction between other microorganisms according to the surrounding environment (Watson et al., 2008). For this reason, it is more important to gain an understanding of microbial communities rather than each type of microorganism. In recent years, analysis of 16S rRNA genes has been used to understand the presence and activity of key organisms such as Dehalococcoides, and to confirm the presence of microorganisms responsible for dechlorination processes at TCE- or PCE-contaminated sites (Fennell and Gossett, 1998; Miller et al., 2007; Nijenhuis et al., 2007; Imfeld et al., 2008a, 2008b; Abe et al., 2009; Maphosa et al., 2010; Imfeld et al., 2011; Tiehm and Schmidt, 2011; Kotik et al., 2013). In relation to evaluating the natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes, the possibility of biodegradation based on geochemical data (groundwater concentration and isotopic ratio of chlorinated contaminants) around the downgradient in the study area has previously been suggested (Kaown et al., 2014a). However, although the potential of biodegradation has been proposed, further investigation is required to obtain more detailed evidence of biodegradation, such as the presence and distribution of dechlorinating bacteria. In addition, where there is a contaminated site adjacent to the stream (such as at the study site), it is important for water resource management to assess whether the stream water has been affected by the contaminant plume.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is discussed in relation to microbial communities and biodegradation processes at contaminated sites, while Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular is not mentioned or connected to the chemical. There is no direct or indirect relationship established between the two terms, as the focus is on environmental microbiology rather than autoimmune conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant connection between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any discussion of their relationship.",
