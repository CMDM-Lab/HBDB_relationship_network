    "context": "The SKW-6 well in the main source zone showed the highest concentrations of dissolved TCE (2018\u03bcg/L), and the least-enriched \u03b413C signatures were found at this site (Table 2). This evidence supports the hypothesis that the isotopic fractionating processes of biodegradation have a minimal impact at this source well. Uncommonly, the isotopic values of TCE at KDPW-4 well in the main source area were slightly enriched (Fig. 4a). However, this isotope pattern is estimated to be related to the cometabolic degradation of TCE under aerobic conditions (Chu et al., 2004; Tiehm and Schmidt, 2011), because KDPW-4 well is located in the upgradient area which is composed of the heterogeneous aquifer and cis-DCE was continuously detected during the monitoring period (Kaown et al., 2014a). The enrichment of \u03b413CTCE values accompanied by declining TCE molar fraction was observed; this is a typical trend for TCE biodegradation. In the study area, the most-enriched \u03b413CTCE values (\u221217.7\u2030) compared to the source values were found in the groundwater sampled from WS-3 well, which is located in the vicinity of the stream (Fig. 4a).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its environmental presence and biodegradation processes, with no mention of Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular. The focus is on the isotopic analysis of TCE in groundwater, indicating its degradation patterns, which do not connect to autoimmune conditions or their mechanisms. Thus, there is no relevant relationship between TCE and the autoimmune syndrome in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a complete lack of relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any direct or indirect connection.",
