    "context": "For TCE we used the following equations: (12) k T C E o x i d = \u03b3 T C E ( p H \u2212 \u03c9 T C E ) \u03b2 T C E for pH < 4 with  p H = \u2212 log C H + . Variations in pH were modeled using the diffusion equation: (13) \u2202 C H + \u2202 t = \u2202 \u2202 x ( \u03b8 w D e , H + w \u2202 C H + \u2202 x ) + \u03b6 T C E r T C E o x i d in which \u03b3 TCE , \u03c9 TCE , and \u03b2 TCE are fitting parameters obtained as part of the simulation results. The parameter \u03b6 TCE is equal to unity according to Eq. (1). Eq. (12) was used to calculate the reaction rate constant for pH values less than 4. The reaction rate constant for TCE is known to be independent of pH in the range of 4\u20138 (Yan and Schwartz, 1999; Waldemer and Tratnyek, 2006). For pH values larger than 4 we used a known value of the reaction rate constant as given in Table\u00a01. Similar equations were employed for the reaction rate coefficients of toluene and ethanol, which both decrease with increasing pH: (14) k A o x i d = \u03b3 A ( \u03c9 A \u2212 p H ) \u03b2 A for pH > 12 while pH variations are controlled by the transport equation: (15) \u2202 C O H \u2212 \u2202 t = \u2202 \u2202 x ( \u03b8 w D e , O H \u2212 w \u2202 C O H \u2212 \u2202 x ) + \u03b6 A r A o x i d ( A = toluene; ethanol ) in which \u03b6 A is the number of moles of hydroxide ions involved in the stoichiometric reaction (\u03b6 toluene =12 and\u03b6 ethanol =4). Similarly as for TCE, Eq. (14) was used to calculate the reaction rate constant for pH values larger than 12 only. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its chemical reaction kinetics and pH-dependent behavior, but there is no mention or connection to Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome. The focus is solely on the chemical properties and modeling of TCE, with no biological or medical implications related to Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder affecting muscle and skeletal development.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a complete lack of relevance between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any direct or indirect relationship.",
