    "context": "Such mass loss is also expected to have occurred for the 40min period at 150ml/min before the air\u2013solvent equilibrium was reached, hence combining mass loss due to rapid transition and air\u2013solvent equilibrium. In order to optimize the gas\u2013solvent phase mass transfer efficiency at high flow rates, a longer solvent column could be used to increase the travel distance through the solvent and hence, increasing the contact surface between the VOC and the solvent. Another possibility is to limit the size of the air bubbles formed using several smaller entry points into the solvent. Note that no Ostwald partitioning coefficient was available for TCE.Solvent mass loss during the purging period Loss of solvent due to volatilization during injection was addressed and the effect of the sampling volume can be seen in Fig. 3 . The solvent mass loss increased with increasing sampling volume. The largest mass loss was observed with the largest air volume (6L) and averaged 17.7% and 14.8% for methanol and ethanol, respectively. As expected, larger mass loss was observed for methanol compared to ethanol, as the latter has a smaller vapour pressure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to solvent mass loss during a purging process. The discussion focuses on optimizing gas-solvent phase mass transfer efficiency and the effects of sampling volume on solvent loss. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relevance between TCE and the purging process beyond the general mention of solvent behavior during purging.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene is part of a broader discussion on solvent mass loss during purging, but there is no detailed exploration of its specific role or significance in the purging process.",
