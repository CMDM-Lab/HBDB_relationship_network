    "context": "As an alternative, in-situ remediation of TCE and other dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) refers to treatment strategies that are applied in the subsurface, such as in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) and enhanced bioremediation. During ISCO remediation, an oxidant solution is released into the zone of NAPL contamination, whereby carbon-based contaminants are oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2). For TCE, the most commonly used oxidant is permanganate, which has the advantage of being effective over a wide pH range, and is relatively stable in the subsurface (Yin and Allen, 1999). The oxidation of TCE proceeds as follows: C 2 Cl 3 H + 2 MnO 4 \u2212 \u2794 2 CO 2 + 2 MnO 2 s + 3 Cl \u2212 + H + In experimental studies and applications at TCE-contaminated sites, permanganate oxidation has been found to be successful at effectively treating TCE contamination (Schnarr et al., 1998; West et al., 1997; Yan and Schwartz, 1999). In particular, permanganate oxidation can be very effective at treating source-zone contamination. However, ISCO also tends to generate CO2 gas as a result of contaminant destruction and the oxidation of soil organic matter. Bioremediation of TCE has been thoroughly investigated in field studies after first being demonstrated in soil columns by Wilson and Wilson (1985). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its remediation through in-situ chemical oxidation and bioremediation techniques. However, there is no mention or connection to Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder affecting muscle function. The two terms appear in the same context but are unrelated in terms of chemical or biological interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct or indirect connection.",
