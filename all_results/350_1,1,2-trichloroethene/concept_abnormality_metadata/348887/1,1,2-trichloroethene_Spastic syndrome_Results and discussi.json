    "context": "VOC concentrations in samples collected along x-and y-streams (SW-1 to SW-21; Fig. 3) provide evidence for plume discharge. Where VOCs were detected, TCE generally exceeded cis-DCE, and VC was not detected in any stream samples. At the outfalls where x- and y-streams begin (SW-1, SW-12) VOCs were not detected, indicating downstream occurrences result from plume discharge. Along the initial stretch of x-stream perpendicular to groundwater flow (SW-2 to SW-7) TCE concentrations increased from non-detect to 8\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg/L, likely a \u2018flow-through\u2019 reach where shallow groundwater discharges to the stream along the upgradient side and mixed groundwater/surface water recharges along the downgradient side. At the stream bend, piezometer nest PN-2 (Fig. 3) showed TCE concentrations of 40, 70 and 1260\u00a0\u03bcg/L at 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0\u00a0m below the stream bed. After the bend, x-stream flows over a small spillway (\u223c0.3\u00a0m high) which likely enhances VOC loss to the atmosphere. Stream TCE concentrations increased from 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L after the spillway (SW-8) to 34\u00a0\u03bcg/L (SW-9) to 60\u00a0\u03bcg/L at Transect 2 (SW-10). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its concentrations in environmental samples, particularly in streams affected by plume discharge. However, there is no mention or discussion of spastic syndrome, which is a neurological condition. The two terms appear in the same context but lack any direct or indirect relationship, as the focus is solely on TCE's environmental impact without any reference to health effects or conditions like spastic syndrome.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a complete lack of relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and spastic syndrome, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
