    "context": "The measurements represent the residual following two 30-minute steps of evaporation and hexane extraction; however, since evaporation occurred not only from the NAPL phase TCE, but also from the adsorbed and aqueous phases, it is difficult to distinguish the distribution of TCE in different phases from these measurements. Thus the mass of residual TCE shown in Fig.\u00a09 should be recognized as the combined residual TCE from the three phases. It can be seen that close to 100% of total mass recovery was achieved in the three experiments. The mass of TCE in the individual grid blocks is essentially consistent with observations, i.e., large masses at spots with observed condensed TCE, and basically uniform distribution in the other areas.Numerical experiment results and discussion As mentioned earlier, the prediction of Kaslusky and Udell (2002), in which a homogeneous porous medium was assumed, suggests that downward movement should occur under the conditions of this study. For Expt 1, however, only slight downward movement of NAPL-phase TCE was observed in the laboratory or predicted in simulation, and no such movement was seen or predicted for Expt 3. This can be attributed to the capillary barrier effect of the finer porous medium. Comparison with the results from numerical Experiment 0, in which TCE was located in a homogeneous porous medium of CS, illustrates this effect further. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its distribution and recovery in various phases during an experimental study. However, there is no mention or connection to exanthema, which is a term typically associated with skin rashes or eruptions. The two terms appear in the same context but lack any direct or indirect relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,1,2-trichloroethene and exanthema are mentioned without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other. They are simply present in the same context without any functional connection.",
