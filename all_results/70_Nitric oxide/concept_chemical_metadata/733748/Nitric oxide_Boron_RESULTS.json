    "context": "[2] Changes in the intracellular H2O2 levels of AD10 cells treated with TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 in the presence or absence of the NO donor SNAP (500 \u00ce\u00bcm) were assessed by fluorescence flow cytometry. [3] ***, p < 0.001. [1] Nitric oxide has been shown to directly affect the structure of NF-\u00ce\u00baB and decrease its DNA-binding ability due to thiol modification of critical amino acid residues . [2] To determine the direct effect of nitric oxide on the activation of NF-kB, we used an enhanced green fluorescent protein-based reporter system driven by four tandem-repeated \u00ce\u00baB responsive elements linked to the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (pNF-\u00ce\u00baB-d2EGFP). [3] We transiently transfected AD10 cells with the pNF-\u00ce\u00baB-d2EGFP reporter vector and then stimulated the cells in the presence or absence of 500 \u00ce\u00bcm SNAP. [4] Cytofluorometric analysis of these cells revealed a significant activation of the reporter gene by TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 and H2O2, and the extent of activation was a function of the concentrations used. [5] The TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-induced activation of the NF-\u00ce\u00baB-dependent reporter gene was significantly decreased in the presence of 500 \u00ce\u00bcm SNAP (Fig.5), corroborating the findings obtained in the NF-\u00ce\u00baB binding assay.

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its effects on the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, particularly its ability to modify the structure of NF-\u03baB and influence its DNA-binding capacity. However, boron is not mentioned or connected to nitric oxide or the NF-\u03baB pathway in any way, indicating no direct or indirect relationship between the two terms within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between nitric oxide and boron, as they are not mentioned together in a relevant context or shown to interact in any meaningful way.",
