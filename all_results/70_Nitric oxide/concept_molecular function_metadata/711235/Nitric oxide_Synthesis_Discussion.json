    "context": "7 Furthermore, we demonstrated that FeNO levels might be predictive of eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation as assessed by induced sputum in patients with SRA. The finding related to eosinophilia is in accordance with that previously reported by Silkoff et al, 27 although the biologic sample in which eosinophils were assessed was different (biopsy specimen vs induced sputum). In another study, where both biopsy specimen and sputum were used to assess airway inflammation, FeNO was increased in the eosinophilic SRA phenotype identified from the bronchial biopsy specimen but not from the induced sputum; however, the predictive value for eosinophilia was not examined. 12 The linkage between FeNO and eosinophils observed in patients with SRA might be explained by either the steroid resistance or the persistent activation of epithelial cells, which are the major site of nitric oxide synthesis and a source of eosinophilic chemoattractant factors. It is important to note that FeNO loses its sensitivity in relation to eosinophils when neutrophils are present along with elevated eosinophils. On the other hand, the weak association found in moderate asthma might be related to the deactivation of eosinophils by steroid treatment. 28 An interesting finding in our study was that FeNO levels are negatively associated with neutrophilic inflammation in SRA, whereas low FeNO levels are predictive of neutrophilia irrespective of the presence of eosinophils.

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a product of epithelial cells, which are significant sites for its synthesis. The study discusses the relationship between fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and eosinophilic inflammation, suggesting that NO synthesis may play a role in the inflammatory processes observed in patients with steroid-resistant asthma (SRA). The synthesis of NO is linked to the presence of eosinophils and their chemoattractant factors, indicating its importance in airway inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and its synthesis in the context of airway inflammation. The evidence presented indicates that epithelial cells are major sites of NO synthesis, which is relevant to the inflammatory processes discussed.",
