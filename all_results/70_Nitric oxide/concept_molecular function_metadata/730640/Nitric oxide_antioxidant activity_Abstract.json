[2] The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the antioxidant activity of garlic can be partially attributed to the inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by cytokine-induced NO synthase (iNOS).  [3] Cardiac myocytes cultured from neonatal Wistar rats were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incubated for 24h with various concentrations of allicin.  [4] This resulted in marked inhibition of nitrite production.  [5] Interestingly, a low concentration of allicin (10\u00ce\u00bcM) was significantly more potent in abrogating the effect of LPS on nitrite production than a higher concentration (40\u00ce\u00bcM).

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the study of antioxidant activity attributed to allicin, a compound in garlic. The research hypothesizes that the antioxidant effects of garlic may involve the inhibition of NO production by cytokine-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The findings indicate that allicin significantly reduces nitrite production, suggesting a direct relationship between allicin's antioxidant activity and the modulation of NO levels in response to inflammatory stimuli.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and antioxidant activity, as the study provides evidence that allicin's antioxidant effects are linked to the inhibition of NO production, demonstrating a clear interaction within the context of inflammation.",
