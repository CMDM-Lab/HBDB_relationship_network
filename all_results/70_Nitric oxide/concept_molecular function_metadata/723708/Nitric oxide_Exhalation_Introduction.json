    "context": "We plan to continue to study the effects of KRG in hypertensive patients and are also interested in the effects of ginseng saponins purified from KRG on the cardiovascular systems to human subjects for further study. Introduction Non-invasive methods are highly desirable for use as diagnostic tools in clinical medicine. 1,2 Asthma is a disease associated with inflammation of the airways and measuring exhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a useful biochemical marker for this condition. 3 The consumption of ethanol and the resulting blood- and breath-alcohol concentrations are exogenous factors that might skew the results of measuring nitric oxide in expired air. 4 The aim of this study was to test whether drinking a moderate dose of ethanol might distort the measurements of NO in exhaled breath determined by chemiluminescence. Methods Subjects Twenty healthy subjects, 10 men with mean (SD) age 44 years (9.7), weight 79kg (10.3) and height 178cm (5.3) and 10 women mean age 35 years (8.5), weight 64kg (12.2) and height 169cm (4.4), participated in this study as paid subjects after approval by the university ethics committee and informed consent. Conditions In exactly  15 min each subject drank 0.40g ethanol per kg body weight; prepared from 95%v/v ethanol and a non-alcoholic drink to give a final concentration of 20%v/v ( \u223c 2 glasses of table wine (12%v/v)). The measurements of FENO followed ATS guidelines 5 starting at  30 min before drinking and then at  30 min , 1, 2, 3, and 4h timed from start of drinking. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is measured in exhaled breath as a non-invasive biomarker for asthma, highlighting its significance in respiratory health. The study investigates how ethanol consumption may affect the accuracy of NO measurements in exhalation. This relationship underscores the importance of understanding exhaled NO levels in diagnosing and monitoring airway inflammation in patients.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and exhalation, as NO is specifically analyzed in exhaled breath for its role as a biomarker in asthma. The context discusses the implications of ethanol on NO measurement, indicating a clear relevance in clinical diagnostics.",
