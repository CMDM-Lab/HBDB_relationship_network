    "context": "The paradigm of constitutive and inducible NOS isoforms has been modified from its original conception (F\u00f6rstermann et al., 1998). In particular, although nNOS and eNOS are constitutively expressed \u2013 and indeed are sometimes collectively referred to as constitutive NOS (cNOS) \u2013 it is becoming increasingly clear that their activity can be regulated by various factors. Conversely, as will be discussed below, iNOS is constitutively expressed at certain sites. Normal airways Nitric oxide (NO) is normally present in the exhaled breath of many mammalian species, including humans, rats, mice, guinea-pigs, rabbits, and elephants (Gustafsson et al., 1991; Leone et al., 1994; Lewandowski et al., 1996). When measured by standardized methods based on chemiluminescence (American Thoracic Society, 2005), the fractional concentration of orally exhaled NO (FENO) in healthy subjects is typically between 5 and 25 parts per billion (ppb). There was initial speculation that the primary source of exhaled NO might in fact be autoinhalation of endogenous NO synthesized in the nasopharynx (Gerlach et al., 1994; Lundberg et al., 1994; M\u00fcnch et al., 1994). However, direct bronchoscopic sampling of lower airway gas clearly demonstrated that NO in exhaled breath is indeed derived from the lower airways (Kharitonov et al., 1996a; Massaro et al., 1996). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed as a naturally occurring component in the exhaled breath of various mammalian species, including humans. The study highlights that exhaled NO is primarily sourced from the lower airways rather than from autoinhalation of endogenous NO. The measurement of fractional concentration of exhaled NO (FENO) is emphasized, indicating its relevance in respiratory physiology and potential clinical applications.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between nitric oxide and exhalation, as the context directly discusses the presence of NO in exhaled breath and its physiological significance, establishing a critical relationship in respiratory health.",
