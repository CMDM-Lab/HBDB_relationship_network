    "context": "Future Directions At this time, single exhaled markers are usually evaluated in isolation; but as indicated above, markers are affected differently in different diseases, and different markers vary in their sensitivity to certain maneuvers, such as the effect of therapy. These differences may be exploited in the future as more markers are characterized, so that each disease may have a characteristic profile or fingerprint of different markers that may be diagnostic in asthma and COPD. Treatments too may impose a characteristic effect on these markers, and this may improve the specificity of treatment in the future, particularly as more potent and specific treatments become available. It is now 15 years since Gustafsson et al. (1991) reported that nitric oxide (NO) is detectable in exhaled breath. During that time, information has accumulated rapidly describing the expression of this molecule in the respiratory tract in health and disease. Although measurement of exhaled NO is now close to approval as a clinical test, however, the significance of many of the observations made remains poorly understood. NO is a freely diffusible redox-based signalling molecule that plays a homeostatic role in multiple physiological processes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a significant marker detectable in exhaled breath, particularly in relation to respiratory health and diseases such as asthma and COPD. The measurement of exhaled NO has gained attention for its potential diagnostic value, indicating that NO plays a crucial role in respiratory physiology and may reflect underlying pathological processes. The relationship between NO and exhalation is underscored by its role as a signaling molecule in the respiratory tract, although the clinical implications of its measurement are still being explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between nitric oxide and exhalation, as NO is specifically mentioned as a detectable marker in exhaled breath with significant implications for respiratory health diagnostics. The context emphasizes its physiological role and potential clinical applications.",
