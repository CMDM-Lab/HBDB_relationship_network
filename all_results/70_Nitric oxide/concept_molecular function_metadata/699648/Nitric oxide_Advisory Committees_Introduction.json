    "context": "[3] Approximately half of those with PCD have situs inversus and male infertility is common []. [4] A European Respiratory Society (ERS) consensus statement on diagnostic techniques includes high-speed video microscopy to assess function and assessment of ciliary ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. [5] Both are time-consuming, technically demanding investigations that are only available in specialist centres []. [6] Difficulty accessing specialist diagnostic services frequently contributes to a delay in diagnosis []; therefore, an ERS PCD Task Force recommended measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) as a screening test [] to improve preselection of patients to travel to centralised diagnostic centres. [7] A survey prior to the ERS consensus statement suggested only 46% of European PCD centres were measuring nNO []. [1] Lundberg et al. [] first reported very low levels of nNO in PCD patients in 1994, but development of nNO as a screening test was slow to establish with only a handful of studies over the next decade [\u00e2\u20ac\u201c]. [2] American Thoracic Society (ATS)/ERS guidelines for the measurement of nNO were published in 1999 and updated in 2005 []. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (nNO) is discussed as a potential screening test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), with recommendations from the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Advisory Committees. The committees emphasize the importance of measuring nNO to improve patient selection for specialized diagnostic services, highlighting its role in enhancing diagnostic efficiency for PCD.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and Advisory Committees, as the committees recommend its measurement for screening purposes, indicating a clear relationship in the context of improving diagnostic practices for PCD.",
