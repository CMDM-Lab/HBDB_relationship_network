    "context": "[3] This highlights need for PCD diagnostic testing in those with strong clinical suspicion even if nNO is normal. [1] A number of studies suggest that patients with CF have nNO concentrations that are lower than in healthy controls (Tables 1 and 2). [2] Although we have demonstrated that levels are generally greater than in PCD, occasional CF patients have nNO in a similar range to PCD patients [, , ]. [3] This may be due to nasal polyposis [], reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase [] or changes in arginine metabolism []. [1] In the small numbers of patients studied, there remains a highly significant difference in nNO levels between PCD, CF and healthy groups measured during tidal breathing despite the influence of lower airway gas mixing (table 5), but the discrimination is poorer than measurement during velum closure [, , , ]. Tidal breathing is the only option for screening younger children who are unable to cooperate with breathing manoeuvres; as nNO levels are lower in healthy children than healthy adults [] false positive rates are as high as 39% in children under 6 years of age []. [2] However, Piacentini et al. [] found a cut-off of 16.2 nL\u00c2\u00b7min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 was 90% sensitive for a PCD diagnosis in children less than 6 months of age. [3] nNO measured during tidal breathing is, therefore, a useful adjunct to clinical suspicion in the screening of young children for PCD with good negative predictive value, but must be interpreted with caution and alongside clinical history, particularly in those under 12 months-old.

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is linked to arginine metabolism through the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which converts arginine into NO. The discussion suggests that changes in arginine metabolism may influence nitric oxide levels, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The lower levels of NO in CF patients could be attributed to alterations in arginine metabolism or reduced inducible NOS activity, indicating a significant relationship between these two terms in the context of respiratory health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and arginine metabolism, as the context discusses how changes in arginine metabolism may affect NO levels, particularly in disease states. This relationship is supported by the mention of inducible nitric oxide synthase and its role in the conversion of arginine to NO.",
