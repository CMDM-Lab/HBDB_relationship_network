    "context": "[8] Alternatively, NO can inhibits O\u00e2\u00a8\u00aa2 production by the modification of the activity of NADPH oxidase, the main enzyme that generates O\u00e2\u00a8\u00aa2 within the cell . [1] Further, we have found that the addition of NO donors to TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-stimulated AD10 cells inhibited either the DNA binding activity of NF-\u00ce\u00baB (Fig. 3) or its activation (Fig. 5). [2] This inhibition was restored to the normal H2O2-stimulated level by treatment with exogenous H2O2. [3] In contrast, nitric oxide did not affect the NF-\u00ce\u00baB activation in untreated AD10 cells, confirming the previous observation with TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 gene expression. [4] These results suggest the presence of at least two pathways in the activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB in AD10 cells that may differ in their sensitivity to H2O2 and the selectivity of nitric oxide to affect just one of these two pathways. [5] The inactivation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB upon NO treatment was not mediated by guanylate cyclase activation since the cGMP analogue 8-bromo-cGMP had no effect on NF-\u00ce\u00baB and we could not block the inhibitory effect of NO on NF-\u00ce\u00baB activation by the use of the guanylate cyclase blocker 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (data not shown). [1] Previous reports have implicated the role of nitric oxide on the activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is shown to influence gene expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated AD10 cells. The study indicates that NO can selectively affect one of the pathways involved in NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting a regulatory role of NO in gene expression related to inflammatory responses. The findings highlight the complex interactions between NO and gene expression mechanisms, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and inflammation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and gene expression, as the context provides evidence of NO's inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB activation, a key transcription factor involved in gene expression. This relationship is supported by experimental data, indicating a clear functional interaction.",
