    "context": "[3] Bartlett's tests were used to establish the homogeneity of variance on the basis of the differences among standard deviations (S.D.). [4] Whenever needed, post hoc unpaired multiple comparison tests (Bonferroni's test) and Student's t test were used for comparison between two groups. [5] Significant differences were considered for those probabilities < 5%  (p < 0.05). [1] To investigate the role of nitric oxide on the sensitization of the human ovarian carcinoma AD10 cell line to TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-mediated cytotoxicity, we first stimulated quiescent AD10 cells with IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 in the presence or absence of 1 mm potent NOS inhibitor l-NMA. [2] The sensitivity of AD10 cells to the cytotoxic effect of increasing concentrations of TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 (0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/ml) was evaluated by the release of LDH into the culture medium after 24 h of incubation. [3] Exposure of AD10 cells to IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 (100 units/ml) for 18 h sensitized the tumor cells to TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-mediated cytotoxicity and the degree of sensitization increased with increasing concentrations of TNF-\u00ce\u00b1. [4] Sensitization by IFN-\u00ce\u00b3 was significantly decreased in the presence of 1 mm NOS inhibitor l-NMA (Fig.1 A). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the sensitization of human ovarian carcinoma AD10 cells to TNF-\u03b1-mediated cytotoxicity. The study indicates that the presence of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, l-NMA, negatively regulates the production of nitric oxide, thereby decreasing the sensitization effect of IFN-\u03b3 on the tumor cells. This suggests a direct relationship where the regulation of NOS activity impacts nitric oxide levels and subsequently influences cellular responses to TNF-\u03b1.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and the negative regulation of nitric-oxide synthase activity, as the study provides evidence that inhibiting NOS affects NO levels and alters the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic agents.",
