    "context": "[4] Cytofluorometric analysis of these cells revealed a significant activation of the reporter gene by TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 and H2O2, and the extent of activation was a function of the concentrations used. [5] The TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-induced activation of the NF-\u00ce\u00baB-dependent reporter gene was significantly decreased in the presence of 500 \u00ce\u00bcm SNAP (Fig.5), corroborating the findings obtained in the NF-\u00ce\u00baB binding assay. [6] The inhibitory activity of SNAP on the TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-induced activation of the NF-\u00ce\u00baB-dependent reporter gene was significantly rescued by stimulation with 200 \u00ce\u00bcm exogenous H2O2 (Fig. 5). [7] These data confirm the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the H2O2-dependent activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB in TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-treated AD10 cells. [8] We also noticed that untreated AD10 cells were able to maintain basal levels of NF-\u00ce\u00baB activation that were not inhibited by treatment with nitric oxide, corroborating the findings observed in the binding assay in Fig. 3. [1] Effect of NO on the TNF -\u00ce\u00b1-dependent activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB. [2] Transiently transfected AD10 cells with the NF-\u00ce\u00baB/2EGFP reporter vector were stimulated with TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 (10 and 100 units/ml) for 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 h in the presence or absence of the NO donor SNAP (500 \u00ce\u00bcm).

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed as an inhibitor of the TNF-\u03b1-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter gene in AD10 cells. The presence of the NO donor SNAP significantly decreased the activation levels, indicating that nitric oxide acts as an inhibitor in this signaling pathway. This relationship highlights the role of NO in modulating inflammatory responses through its inhibitory effects on NF-\u03baB activation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and its role as an inhibitor in the context of TNF-\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activation. The evidence provided shows a clear inhibitory effect of NO, supported by experimental data, indicating a strong relevance in the context of inflammation.",
