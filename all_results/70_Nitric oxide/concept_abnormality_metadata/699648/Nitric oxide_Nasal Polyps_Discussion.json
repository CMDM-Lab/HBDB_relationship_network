    "context": "[3] This highlights need for PCD diagnostic testing in those with strong clinical suspicion even if nNO is normal. [1] A number of studies suggest that patients with CF have nNO concentrations that are lower than in healthy controls (Tables 1 and 2). [2] Although we have demonstrated that levels are generally greater than in PCD, occasional CF patients have nNO in a similar range to PCD patients [, , ]. [3] This may be due to nasal polyposis [], reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase [] or changes in arginine metabolism []. [1] In the small numbers of patients studied, there remains a highly significant difference in nNO levels between PCD, CF and healthy groups measured during tidal breathing despite the influence of lower airway gas mixing (table 5), but the discrimination is poorer than measurement during velum closure [, , , ]. Tidal breathing is the only option for screening younger children who are unable to cooperate with breathing manoeuvres; as nNO levels are lower in healthy children than healthy adults [] false positive rates are as high as 39% in children under 6 years of age []. [2] However, Piacentini et al. [] found a cut-off of 16.2 nL\u00c2\u00b7min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 was 90% sensitive for a PCD diagnosis in children less than 6 months of age. [3] nNO measured during tidal breathing is, therefore, a useful adjunct to clinical suspicion in the screening of young children for PCD with good negative predictive value, but must be interpreted with caution and alongside clinical history, particularly in those under 12 months-old.

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (nNO) levels are discussed in relation to nasal polyps, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of nasal polyposis may contribute to reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which in turn affects nNO concentrations. This suggests a potential link between nasal polyps and altered nitric oxide metabolism, impacting diagnostic testing for conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and nasal polyps, as the context indicates that nasal polyposis may influence nNO levels through changes in nitric oxide synthase activity. This relationship is supported by clinical observations, indicating a clear relevance.",
