    "context": "[5] This discrepancy is unexplained. [6] In the meantime, we agree that further mechanistic research is needed to try to understand why airflow obstruction develops and how it contributes to the pathophysiology of lung disease in these children. [7] oas_tag.loadAd(Middle1);  [1] Arginine deficiency in sepsis may impair nitric oxide (NO) production for local perfusion and add to the catabolic state.  [2] In contrast, excessive NO production has been related to global haemodynamic instability.  [3] Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the dose\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse effect of intravenous arginine supplementation in post-absorptive patients with septic shock on arginine-NO and protein metabolism and on global and regional haemodynamics.  [4] Eight critically ill patients with a diagnosis of septic shock participated in this short-term (8\u00c2\u00a0h) dose\u00e2\u20ac\u201cresponse study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to septicemia, particularly focusing on its production influenced by arginine levels during septic shock. Arginine deficiency may reduce NO production, affecting local perfusion and contributing to a catabolic state, while excessive NO production is linked to global hemodynamic instability. The study aims to explore how intravenous arginine supplementation impacts NO levels and overall hemodynamics in patients with septic shock.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and septicemia, as the context discusses how NO production is affected by arginine levels in septic shock, indicating a clear physiological relationship with implications for treatment.",
