    "context": "Therefore, the proposed method suppresses the most serious hazards of the initial compound by fixing chloride in a solid, non-volatile form. The method must be implemented at low microwave power and flow-rate levels in order to avoid the production of N2O and NO. Although these two species appear at substantial concentrations if the operating conditions ensuring maximal destruction are used, the proposed system allows one to use flow-rate and microwave power values over wide enough ranges to ensure minimal environmental contamination with a high energy efficiency. Exhaled Nitric Oxide Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has been extensively investigated in asthma and has been shown to correlate with predominantly eosinophilic airway inflammation and to be reduced by corticosteroid therapy. There are European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society recommendations for measuring FeNO. 4 The measurement is highly reproducible in normal and asthmatic subjects if careful attention is paid to technique. 5 Until recently, no day-to-day and home FeNO monitoring was possible, as portable and simple nitric oxide (NO) analyzers were not available. The arrival of handheld portable NO analyzers that allows FeNO measurements with sufficient accuracy and reproducibility may considerably change current management of asthma, as FeNO can be measured on a daily basis by patients at home and frequently during their regular visits to their general practitioner.

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to asthma through the measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which serves as a biomarker for eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. The correlation between elevated FeNO levels and asthma severity highlights the importance of NO in asthma management, particularly with the advent of portable analyzers that enable regular monitoring of FeNO levels at home, potentially improving patient care and treatment outcomes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between nitric oxide and asthma, as FeNO is a well-established biomarker for asthma management, indicating inflammation and response to corticosteroid therapy. The context emphasizes the significance of NO in asthma diagnosis and monitoring.",
