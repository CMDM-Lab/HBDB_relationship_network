    "context": "[10] Long-term oral treatment with CCB was restricted to the nine acute responders and a sustained clinical and haemodynamic improvement was observed in only six patients. [11] In primary pulmonary hypertension, the acute response rate to high doses of calcium-channel blockers is low (27%). [12] Serious adverse reactions to high doses of calcium-channel blockers during acute testing are frequently observed in nonresponders. [13] It is concluded that nitric oxide may be used as a screening agent for safely identifying patients with primary pulmonary hypertension who respond acutely to calcium-channel blockers and may benefit from long-term treatment with these agents. [1] Murine models of invasive candidiasis were used to study the in vivo importance of gamma interferon (IFN-\u00ce\u00b3) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in host defense against Candida albicans and to characterize the tissue inflammatory reactions, with special reference to macrophages (M\u00cf\u2020). [2] Knockout (KO) IFN-\u00ce\u00b3-deficient (GKO) and IL-4-deficient (IL-4 KO) and C57BL/6 parental mouse strains were challenged intraperitoneally with 108 C. albicans blastoconidia. [3] Survival of GKO mice was significantly lower (16.7%) ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide is highlighted as a potential screening agent for identifying patients with primary pulmonary hypertension who may respond positively to calcium-channel blockers. The study suggests that nitric oxide could help determine which patients are likely to benefit from long-term treatment with these medications, indicating a significant relationship between nitric oxide and primary pulmonary hypertension management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between nitric oxide and primary pulmonary hypertension, as nitric oxide is proposed as a screening tool to identify responsive patients for treatment, supported by clinical implications in the context.",
