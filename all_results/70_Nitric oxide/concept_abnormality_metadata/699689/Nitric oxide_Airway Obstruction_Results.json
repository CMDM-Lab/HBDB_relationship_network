    "context": "For the BPD group, we identified lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) [LPC(20:2(11Z,14Z))] and platelet activating factor (PAF) [PC(O-18:2(9Z,12Z)/2:0)] as putative biomarkers for variable 548 [retention time (RT) 10.4549\u00a0m/z 548.3662], the\u00a0unsaturated phosphatidylcholines [PC(4:0/18:1(9Z)] and\u00a0[PC(18:1(9Z)/4:0] for variable 592 (RT 10.555\u00a0m/z 592.3934), and a\u00a0plasmenyl-phosphatidylserine [PS(P-16:0/12:0)] for variable 664 (RT 11.3996\u00a0m/z 664.449). For the healthy group: hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid for variable 319 (RT 13.2048 m/z 319.2286), and phosphatidylserine [PS(12:0/16:0)] for variable 680 (RT 10.7219\u00a0m/z 680.446). From a functional viewpoint, subjects with BPD, as expected, had significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) worse spirometric measurements than healthy controls (forced vital capacity [FVC] [mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SEM]: 87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4%predicted [pred] vs 106\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4%pred; forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0second [FEV1] 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5%pred vs 105\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6%pred; FEV1/FVC 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4% vs 90%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3; forced expiratory flow at 25-75% 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4%pred vs 122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5%pred). In particular, airway obstruction was mild (FEV1 >70%) in 6 subjects with BPD, and it was severe (FEV1 between 50% and 70%) in the remaining 14. Exhaled nitric oxide values did not differ between healthy (median [IQR] 13.2\u00a0ppb [7.9-16.8]) and subjects with BPD (10.6\u00a0ppb [8.8-13.2]). Discussion We applied the metabolomic approach to studying the EBC of survivors of BPD to assess, by means of an unbiased strategy, the biochemical-metabolic profile of these subjects' airways. We demonstrated that metabolomic analysis can clearly discriminate adolescents with a history of BPD from healthy controls. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is mentioned in relation to airway obstruction in subjects with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although exhaled nitric oxide levels were measured, they did not significantly differ between healthy controls and BPD subjects, suggesting that NO may not be a reliable biomarker for assessing airway obstruction severity in this population. The spirometric measurements indicate varying degrees of airway obstruction, but the lack of difference in NO levels implies a complex relationship that may not directly correlate with the degree of obstruction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitric oxide is assessed in the context of airway obstruction, but the findings indicate no significant difference in NO levels between groups, suggesting a nuanced relationship rather than a direct correlation.",
