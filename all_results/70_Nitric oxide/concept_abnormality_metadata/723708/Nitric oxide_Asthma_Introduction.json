    "context": "These data suggest that KRG would be useful for the treatment of hypertension and pulmonary vascular obstruction. We plan to continue to study the effects of KRG in hypertensive patients and are also interested in the effects of ginseng saponins purified from KRG on the cardiovascular systems to human subjects for further study. Introduction Non-invasive methods are highly desirable for use as diagnostic tools in clinical medicine. 1,2 Asthma is a disease associated with inflammation of the airways and measuring exhaled nitric oxide (NO) is a useful biochemical marker for this condition. 3 The consumption of ethanol and the resulting blood- and breath-alcohol concentrations are exogenous factors that might skew the results of measuring nitric oxide in expired air. 4 The aim of this study was to test whether drinking a moderate dose of ethanol might distort the measurements of NO in exhaled breath determined by chemiluminescence. Methods Subjects Twenty healthy subjects, 10 men with mean (SD) age 44 years (9.7), weight 79kg (10.3) and height 178cm (5.3) and 10 women mean age 35 years (8.5), weight 64kg (12.2) and height 169cm (4.4), participated in this study as paid subjects after approval by the university ethics committee and informed consent. Conditions In exactly  15 min each subject drank 0.40g ethanol per kg body weight; prepared from 95%v/v ethanol and a non-alcoholic drink to give a final concentration of 20%v/v ( \u223c 2 glasses of table wine (12%v/v)).

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a useful biochemical marker for asthma, a condition characterized by airway inflammation. The study aims to investigate how ethanol consumption may affect the measurement of NO in exhaled breath, which is relevant for diagnosing asthma. This suggests a direct relationship between NO levels and asthma diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of accurate measurement in clinical settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and asthma, as NO is specifically mentioned as a marker for asthma diagnosis. The context discusses the implications of measuring NO in relation to asthma, indicating a clear relevance in clinical assessment.",
