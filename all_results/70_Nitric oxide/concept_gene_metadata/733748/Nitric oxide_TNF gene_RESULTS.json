    "context": "[4] Cytofluorometric analysis of these cells revealed a significant activation of the reporter gene by TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 and H2O2, and the extent of activation was a function of the concentrations used. [5] The TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-induced activation of the NF-\u00ce\u00baB-dependent reporter gene was significantly decreased in the presence of 500 \u00ce\u00bcm SNAP (Fig.5), corroborating the findings obtained in the NF-\u00ce\u00baB binding assay. [6] The inhibitory activity of SNAP on the TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-induced activation of the NF-\u00ce\u00baB-dependent reporter gene was significantly rescued by stimulation with 200 \u00ce\u00bcm exogenous H2O2 (Fig. 5). [7] These data confirm the inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on the H2O2-dependent activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB in TNF-\u00ce\u00b1-treated AD10 cells. [8] We also noticed that untreated AD10 cells were able to maintain basal levels of NF-\u00ce\u00baB activation that were not inhibited by treatment with nitric oxide, corroborating the findings observed in the binding assay in Fig. 3. [1] Effect of NO on the TNF -\u00ce\u00b1-dependent activation of NF-\u00ce\u00baB. [2] Transiently transfected AD10 cells with the NF-\u00ce\u00baB/2EGFP reporter vector were stimulated with TNF-\u00ce\u00b1 (10 and 100 units/ml) for 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3 h in the presence or absence of the NO donor SNAP (500 \u00ce\u00bcm).

        "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is shown to inhibit the TNF-\u03b1-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB-dependent reporter gene in AD10 cells. The presence of the NO donor SNAP significantly decreased the activation caused by TNF-\u03b1, indicating a regulatory role of nitric oxide in modulating the inflammatory response mediated by TNF-\u03b1. This suggests a direct interaction where nitric oxide acts as a negative regulator of TNF-\u03b1 signaling pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitric oxide and the TNF gene, as the data demonstrates a clear inhibitory effect of nitric oxide on TNF-\u03b1-induced gene activation, supported by experimental evidence.",
