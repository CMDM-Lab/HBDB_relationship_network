    "context": "Associated with the previous remark, this result could explain why the combination UP 20/pine bark generated the highest and fastest oxygen consumption. As expected, pozzolan, which has no nutritive function, generated very poor oxygen consumption throughout the 5 d (around 0.5mgl\u22121). Fig. 5 presents the mass balance of sulfur for the five types of support studied. As has already been observed in the case of ammonia removal, pine bark still showed the best adsorptive properties: the adsorbed amount of sulfur ranged between 25% and 30% of the initial amount. Except for pozzolan, non-adsorbed sulfur is almost entirely biotransformed by biomass. Concerning the treatment of hydrogen sulfide under real biofiltration conditions, the results obtained here are encouraging to study UP 20 as a packing material in laboratory-scale plant experiments. Although the addition of pozzolan will have no effect on hydrogen sulfide biodegradation, it could be used to improve the mechanical resistance of the filter bed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned in relation to its removal and the performance of different materials in biotransformation processes. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of the ADRBK1 gene, which is typically associated with biological pathways and cellular functions. The relationship between ammonia and the ADRBK1 gene is not established, indicating a lack of relevance in this specific context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that ammonia and the ADRBK1 gene are mentioned in the same context but without any direct or indirect relationship discussed. They appear coincidentally without any functional or biological connection.",
