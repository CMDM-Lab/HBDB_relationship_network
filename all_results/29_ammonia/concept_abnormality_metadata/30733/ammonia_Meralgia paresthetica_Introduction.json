    "context": "Ammonia exists in digestate as ammonium ion ( NH 4 + ) and free ammonia ( NH 3 ). Ammonia mass transfer in stripping follows the Fick's first law of diffusion through liquid/gas phases as expressed by Lewis-Whitman model (Equation (1)) (Tao and Ukwuani, 2015). The driving force is the difference between free ammonia concentration and its saturation concentration. The fraction of free ammonia in total ammonia increases with increasing temperature as shown in Equations (2)\u2013(4) and saturation concentration decreases with increasing temperature (Green and Perry, 2007; Tillner-Roth and Friend, 1998; Smolen et\u00a0al., 1991; Bower and Bidwell, 1978; Whitfield, 1974), thus creating a greater driving force at a higher temperature for efficient stripping. Meanwhile, a lower vacuum pressure increases free ammonia fraction as shown in Equations (2) and (4). Ammonia saturation concentration changes little with vacuum in the absolute pressure range of 20.0\u2013101.3 kPa (Whitfield, 1974; Salavera et\u00a0al., 2005). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its physical properties and behavior in digestate, particularly focusing on its mass transfer and concentration dynamics. However, there is no mention or implication of a relationship between ammonia and Meralgia paresthetica, a condition characterized by nerve compression leading to pain and numbness in the thigh. The two terms appear unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a complete lack of relationship between ammonia and Meralgia paresthetica, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any direct or indirect connection.",
