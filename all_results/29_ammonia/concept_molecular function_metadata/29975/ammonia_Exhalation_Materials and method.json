    "context": "Nicotine, ammonia, formaldehyde and acetone were analyzed by using GC-FID (7890\u202fGC System, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), IC (DIONEX\u2122 ICS3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) (LC1290 Infinity 2, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), respectively. Participants were asked to refrain from smoking cigarettes from the time they woke up in the morning until the end of the exhalation measurements to prevent contaminations originating from cigarette smoke. To measure background levels of exhalations, each exhalation before puffing of the NTV was collected by the sampling system and repeated 10 times with a frequency of 30\u202fs (10 exhalations). Ten exhalation samples were collected for each analysis of nicotine, ammonia and for formaldehyde plus acetone. After the background measurements, each exhalation just after each puffing-inhalation of the NTV was collected according to the same procedure mentioned above. After 10 exhalations, the panel person rinsed their mouth with drinking water to prevent chemical contaminations before sampling of the next 10 exhalations. The effect of Novel Tobacco Vapor (NTV) product use on indoor air quality (IAQ) was examined and evaluated in a test chamber. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is analyzed as one of the volatile compounds exhaled by participants during a study on indoor air quality after using a Novel Tobacco Vapor (NTV) product. The study involves measuring background levels of ammonia in exhalations before and after tobacco use, indicating a direct relationship between ammonia and the process of exhalation as a means of assessing exposure and contamination levels from tobacco products.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and exhalation, as ammonia is specifically measured in exhaled breath samples to evaluate the impact of tobacco use. The context provides a clear methodological framework for analyzing ammonia levels in relation to exhalation.",
        "score": 4
