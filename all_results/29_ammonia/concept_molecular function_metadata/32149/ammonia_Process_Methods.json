    "context": "Ammonia concentration was measured in situ at the gas outlet of the composting reactor by means of an ammonia sensor (Industrial Scientific sensor iTX-T82, Oakdale, PA, USA) with a measurement range of 0\u20131200ppmv. The sensor was placed inside a hermetic recipient with inlet and outlet holes that allowed gas circulation. The measurement was taken when the value was stabilized during a period of constant flow. Ammonia was measured just before the water trap installed to protect the rest of measurement devices from moisture avoiding the effect of ammonia solubilization in the condensate water from the composting process exhaust gases.GC\u2013MS detection A sample from each process was taken daily in a 250mL glass gas collector. VOC characterization was performed using air samples analyzed by SPME (Solid Phase Micro Extraction)/GC\u2013MS, as previously reported by other authors (Orzi et al., 2010). A manual SPME device with divinylbenzene (DVB)/Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 50\u201330\u03bcm fiber from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used. The compounds were adsorbed from the air samples by exposing the fiber (preconditioned for 1h at 270\u00b0C, as suggested by the supplier) to the sample in the glass gas collector for 30min at room temperature.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is measured as part of the composting process, specifically at the gas outlet of a composting reactor. The measurement of ammonia concentration is crucial for monitoring the efficiency and environmental impact of the composting process. The methodology described involves using an ammonia sensor and gas sampling techniques to analyze volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during composting, indicating that ammonia is a significant component of the process being studied.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and the composting process, as ammonia concentration is directly measured and analyzed to assess the process's performance and emissions. The context provides clear evidence of ammonia's relevance to the composting process.",
        "score": 4
