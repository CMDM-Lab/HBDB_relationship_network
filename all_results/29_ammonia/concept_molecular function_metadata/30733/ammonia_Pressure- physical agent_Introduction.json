The first objective of this study was to develop boiling point temperature-vacuum curves and investigate how ammonia mass transfer is affected by boiling point temperature and vacuum combinations. To the best of our knowledge, ammonia mass transfer kinetic constants (K L and C s ) have not been reported previously for digestate or wastewater at a reduced pressure as in vacuum thermal stripping. The kinetic constants provide essential data for design and feasibility study of this novel process. Moreover, the purity of a chemical product recovered from wastewater determines its market value and economic feasibility. Digestate contains various volatile compounds which may be stripped along with ammonia. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its mass transfer kinetics during a process influenced by pressure, specifically in vacuum thermal stripping. The study aims to understand how varying boiling point temperatures and reduced pressure affect the transfer of ammonia from digestate or wastewater. The relationship is significant as pressure is a physical agent that impacts the behavior and efficiency of ammonia transfer in the system being studied.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ammonia and pressure, as the context explicitly discusses how pressure influences ammonia mass transfer kinetics, indicating a clear and significant relationship supported by the study's objectives.",
