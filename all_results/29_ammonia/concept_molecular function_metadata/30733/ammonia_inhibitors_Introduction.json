    "context": "Thermal stripping occurs most efficiently at the boiling temperature, but there is no need to introduce a stripping gas. Water vapor and mists are trapped in the stripper while stripped ammonia was absorbed to sulfuric acid to produce crystalline ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4. When the thermal stripping \u2013 acid absorption process is applied to a recirculation line of an anaerobic digester, the need to heat digesters can be eliminated or reduced due to heat recycling, thus making this energy-intensive process profitable (Anwar and Tao, 2016). When ammonia concentration in digestate is reduced to a level that is not inhibitory to methanogens, anaerobic digesters could be operated at a higher organic loading rate without instability issue. Unlike the other ammonia recovery methods, thermal stripping allows feed with high concentrations of solids, thus eliminating the need to separate solids from liquid of digestate. The digestate remains anaerobic after thermal stripping and is safe to be recirculated to anaerobic digesters. Besides, thermal treatment even at the stripping temperatures may enhance hydrolysis of particulate organic matter (Ruffino et\u00a0al., 2015; Serna-Maza et\u00a0al., 2014, 2015; Wang et\u00a0al., 2014), thus increasing methane production of anaerobic digestion when ammonia-recovered digestate is returned to digesters.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its concentration levels in digestate during anaerobic digestion processes. The text indicates that reducing ammonia concentration is crucial to prevent inhibition of methanogens, which are essential for stable digestion. While inhibitors are not explicitly defined, the implication is that high ammonia levels act as inhibitors to methanogenic activity, thus affecting the efficiency of anaerobic digesters. The thermal stripping process is highlighted as a method to manage ammonia levels effectively, allowing for improved operational conditions in digesters.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and its inhibitory effects on methanogens in anaerobic digestion. The context provides evidence of how managing ammonia levels can enhance digestion efficiency, indicating a clear relationship supported by the process described.",
