    "context": "Moreover, the purity of a chemical product recovered from wastewater determines its market value and economic feasibility. Digestate contains various volatile compounds which may be stripped along with ammonia. The second objective was to explore various methods to harvest (NH4)2SO4 crystals and examine product quality at both laboratory and pilot scales. Laboratory setup and batch operation A laboratory assembly for ammonia recovery using the vacuum thermal stripping - acid absorption process is given in Fig.\u00a01 . Each batch experiment had 0.3\u00a0L of manure digestate fed to a 2-L triple-neck spherical boiling flask. The digestate was taken at a dairy farm located in Cayuga County, New York, USA. The farm treats liquid dairy manure in mesophilic anaerobic digesters and reduces solids content of digester effluent with a screw press separator. ",
