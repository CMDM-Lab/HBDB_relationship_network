    "context": "Recently, in-digester and post-digestion ammonia recovery has been investigated using methods such as gas-stripping coupled with acid absorption, membrane distillation, and struvite precipitation (Tao et\u00a0al., 2016; Lu et\u00a0al., 2015; Serna-Maza et\u00a0al., 2015; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2015; Zarebska et\u00a0al., 2014). Unlike ammonia removal, ammonia recovery extracts ammonia from digestate and produces marketable products. Except for an integrated ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and cold stripping process (Ledda et\u00a0al., 2013), nevertheless, the research has not resulted in industry adoption due to economic feasibility concerns and technical challenges. In an effort to overcome these barriers, the authors developed a thermal stripping process (Tao and Ukwuani, 2015), in which both conversion of ammonium to free ammonia and stripping of free ammonia out of digestate were enhanced by thermal treatment. Thermal stripping occurs most efficiently at the boiling temperature, but there is no need to introduce a stripping gas. Water vapor and mists are trapped in the stripper while stripped ammonia was absorbed to sulfuric acid to produce crystalline ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4. When the thermal stripping \u2013 acid absorption process is applied to a recirculation line of an anaerobic digester, the need to heat digesters can be eliminated or reduced due to heat recycling, thus making this energy-intensive process profitable (Anwar and Tao, 2016).

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is central to various recovery processes investigated for its extraction from digestate, including thermal stripping and acid absorption. The processes aim to convert and recover ammonia efficiently, producing marketable products like ammonium sulfate. The development of these processes addresses economic and technical challenges in ammonia recovery, highlighting the significance of ammonia in the context of waste management and resource recovery.",
