    "context": "The present study operated the pilot system at 65\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C and 25.3\u201334.7\u00a0kPa with 10\u201315\u00a0L of the dairy manure digestate, municipal sludge digestate, foodwaste digestate from a pilot-scale anaerobic digester and a full-scale anaerobic digestion plant, and reverse osmosis retentate of landfill leachate. Based on the estimated ammonia concentrations in the digestates and stoichiometry of ammonia reaction with sulfuric acid, 1\u00a0L of 2\u20134\u00a0N H2SO4 solution was added to the absorption column. Each batch lasted for 2\u20134\u00a0h, depending on the estimated ammonia concentration in the digestate and expected effluent concentration. Initial and final feed samples were collected for determination of total ammonia and total solids concentrations. The acid solution was sampled at the end of each batch and analyzed for total ammonia concentration. The volumes of digestate feed and acid solution were measured at the end of each batch. When the acid solution that was initially saturated with (NH4)2SO4 was used, crystals formed as the acid solution was cooled down to room temperature. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its concentration in various digestates and its reaction with sulfuric acid during the anaerobic digestion process. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears unrelated to the chemical processes described, as it typically refers to a legal or formal decision-making process, not a chemical or biological interaction. Therefore, there is no meaningful relationship between ammonia and adjudication in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between ammonia and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect connection.",
