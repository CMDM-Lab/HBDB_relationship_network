    "context": "The fractions of total ammonia remaining at the beginning of vacuum thermal stripping (or the end of temperature ramping) were similar across the 7 boiling conditions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.66). However, the fractions were significantly higher at stripping temperatures of 50 and 58\u00a0\u00b0C than those at 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C after 1.5\u00a0h of stripping (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; LSD\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and 3\u00a0h of stripping (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; LSD\u00a0=\u00a00.03), which suggested slower stripping of ammonia at 50\u201358\u00a0\u00b0C than 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C. Similarly, the ammonia mass transfer coefficients (K L ) were significantly smaller at 50\u201358\u00a0\u00b0C than those at 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008; LSD\u00a0=\u00a09.0) as given in Table\u00a01 . The suction effect of vacuum would enhance gas-phase ammonia mass transfer, but it may not improve overall mass transfer any more as vacuum pressure decreases further below 25.1\u00a0kPa. This coincides with earlier studies that ammonia mass transfer coefficient is much more sensitive to a change of air velocity in a lower velocity range than that in a higher velocity range (Ye et\u00a0al., 2008; Arogo et\u00a0al., 1999). Meanwhile, free ammonia accounted for only 79\u201388% of total ammonia at 50\u201358\u00a0\u00b0C compared with 92\u201399% at 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C. The ammonia saturation concentrations (C s ) were similar across the seven combinations of boiling point temperature and vacuum (p\u00a0=\u00a00.25), although it appeared to have a higher C s at a lower temperature as shown in Table\u00a01.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its mass transfer during vacuum thermal stripping under various pressure conditions. The study indicates that vacuum pressure enhances the gas-phase mass transfer of ammonia, but its effectiveness diminishes below a certain pressure threshold. The relationship highlights how physical pressure influences the behavior and transfer efficiency of ammonia in thermal processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and pressure, as the context provides evidence of how vacuum pressure affects ammonia mass transfer rates. The findings suggest a clear relationship between the physical agent (pressure) and the behavior of ammonia during thermal stripping.",
