    "context": "Compared with thermal stripping, it allows ammonia recovery at a greater flow rate in a recirculation line of an anaerobic digester because of the lower boiling point temperature. Moreover, it creates opportunities for stripping digester effluent and other ammonia-rich wastewater, followed by\u00a0downstream temperature-dependent treatment without recirculation. Vacuum thermal stripping of ammonia could be well simulated by the Lewis-Whitman model. The driving force to strip ammonia varies with both feed temperature and stripper vacuum. The optimum boiling point was at temperature 65\u00a0\u00b0C and vacuum pressure 25.1\u00a0kPa. At 65\u00a0\u00b0C and 25.1\u00a0kPa, more than 95% of ammonia could be stripped out of digestate in 1.5\u00a0h with an ammonia mass transfer coefficient as high as 37.3\u00a0mm/h. With an ammonia saturation concentration as low as 0\u201313\u00a0mg\u00a0N/L during vacuum thermal stripping at temperature above 65\u00a0\u00b0C, ammonia concentration in digestate could be decreased substantially.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and force are related through the process of vacuum thermal stripping in an anaerobic digester. The driving force for stripping ammonia is influenced by both the feed temperature and the vacuum pressure applied. The study highlights how these parameters optimize the recovery of ammonia, indicating a direct relationship between the physical forces involved and the efficiency of ammonia removal from wastewater.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and force, as the context discusses how the driving force for ammonia stripping is dependent on specific temperature and vacuum conditions, demonstrating a clear relationship supported by quantitative data.",
        "score": 4
