    "context": "Although data obtained is only representative of the studied system, the methodology applied can be used in any other type of composting plants using different composting technologies.Step 1: Data collection on plant characteristics and operation The collection of data is systematically carried out using a specifically-designed questionnaire. Plant characteristics are classified into general, historical and socio-economical data and they include information such as plant capacity, soil occupation, characteristics of the final product obtained (compost) including amount and product destination, the quantities of waste treated and energy and water consumptions and other plant operation data. It is interesting to have reliable data on plant operation in order to relate the values of gaseous emissions obtained to these data and propose emission minimization options, if necessary. Plant operation data is then grouped and related to process main operations, i.e. reception, pre-treatment, waste decomposition phase, curing phase and post-treatment including type of process (composting technology), turning and/or aeration periodicity, watering, amount of rejected materials obtained from pre and post-treatment operations, type and amount of energy used (electric or fuel) and characteristics of the equipment and machinery used.Step 2: Determination of atmospheric emissions The pollutants studied in the present work were ammonia and total VOC. This group includes practically all types of hydrocarbons such as alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, organic acids, terpenes, etc. although the identification of single compounds present in VOC was out of the scope of this work. Ammonia was analyzed in situ using an Industrial Scientific multigas sensor iTX-T82 (Oakdale, PA, USA) with an ammonia detection range from 0 to 200mLm\u22123 and a temperature range from 20 to 50\u00b0C. Total VOC were determined in the laboratory by gas chromatography (see Step 3) from gas samples obtained in the plant using 1L Tedlar bags and a gas pump (SKC Universal de Luxe, Eighty Four, PA, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a pollutant studied in relation to composting plant operations, specifically during the reception phase of waste. The reception phase involves collecting and processing waste materials, which can lead to the emission of ammonia and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the relationship between ammonia and the reception phase is not deeply explored beyond its mention as a pollutant associated with the operational data collection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ammonia is identified as a pollutant related to the reception phase of composting operations. However, there is no detailed discussion of how ammonia specifically interacts with or impacts the reception process.",
