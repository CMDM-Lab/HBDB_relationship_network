    "context": "The concentrations of the compounds that were identified can be calculated from the following: (1) C = m Q \u00b7 t where m is the quantity of analyte adsorbed on the cartridge, Q is the sampling rate, and t is the sampling period. The sampling rate (Q) can be calculated from the following: (2) Q ( cm 3 / s ) = k ( cm ) \u00b7 D AB ( cm 2 / s ) where k is the Radiello\u00ae geometric constant and DAB is the diffusion coefficient of the organic compounds in air. The diffusion coefficients were predicted by the method developed in Fuller et al. (1966). 2.2.2 Landfill leaks \u2013 Ammonia and hydrogen sulphide: These compounds were analyzed directly at leaks from the landfill site using an MX6 Ibrid portable detector. Several readings were taken to get a representative result. A total of 10 readings were taken from 2 different landfill leaks, and the total acquisition time was around 5min. \u2013 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): Radiello\u00ae diffusive samplers were positioned in places close to the landfill leaks for two days, less time than in the other point sources\u2019 samplings, because the concentration in landfill leaks was expected to be higher than in the other point sources. There were two Radiello\u00ae diffusive samplers to each of the two landfill leaks that were sampled. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a compound analyzed at landfill leaks, while 'Leak NOS' likely refers to a specific type of leak detection system or methodology. However, there is no direct discussion of how ammonia interacts with or relates to Leak NOS. The focus is primarily on the measurement of ammonia concentrations at landfill sites without elaborating on any specific relationship with Leak NOS.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as ammonia and Leak NOS are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or relevance discussed between them.",
