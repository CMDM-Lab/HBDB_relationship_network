    "context": "It was observed that a higher binder mass proportion induced a more homogenous carbonate and calcium release rate and limited a massive dissolution during the first set. For phosphorus and nitrogen, the minimum release rate was low with all the materials and was reached during the second set. These low dissolving rates of these elements may favor the lifetime of formulated materials. As Am materials generated malodorous ammonia emissions, UP materials were considered a better nitrogen source. Every material generated a basic pH whereas a neutral pH is an optimum condition for bacterial growth. However, this may buffer the filter bed in the case of hydrogen sulfide biofiltration, which generates acidic compounds. Moreover, oxygen consumption measurements showed an interesting alternative to avoid basic pH as the combination of UP 20 and pine bark both induced a pH near to neutrality and generated the fastest and highest bacterial growth.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and nitrogen are related through their roles in the release and utilization of nutrients in formulated materials. Ammonia emissions are noted as a byproduct of certain materials, while nitrogen is highlighted as a better nutrient source. The discussion suggests that ammonia, a nitrogen compound, impacts the pH and bacterial growth conditions, indicating a functional relationship between the two in the context of material formulation and microbial activity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and nitrogen, as ammonia is a nitrogenous compound that influences nutrient dynamics and pH in the context of bacterial growth. The context provides evidence of their interaction in material formulation, supporting a clear relationship.",
        "score": 4
