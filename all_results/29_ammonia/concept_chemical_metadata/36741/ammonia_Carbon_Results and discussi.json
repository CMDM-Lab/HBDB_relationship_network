    "context": "This makes the latter unsuitable for biofiltration so they were not studied further. Concerning the porosity of the formulated materials, a slight variation in the median pore diameter was observed between Am and UP type materials; from 309 to 351nm for Am and from 446 to 517nm for UP. Nevertheless, as these values are smaller than the mean length of a microorganism cell, the biomass attachment could take place only on the surface of the granules.Chemical properties Table 2 shows the dissolving rates of C, N, P and Ca elements after 24h of immersion obtained throughout four successive solid\u2013liquid contacts for the four formulated materials Am 5, Am 10, UP 20 and UPt 20. In the case of a biofiltration process treating air polluted by inorganic compounds such as ammonia or hydrogen sulfide, the carbonate contained in the formulated materials could be used as a carbon source by the microorganisms. In general, the results showed that the maximum release occur for the first set of solid\u2013liquid contacts. For both types of material (Am, UP), the maximum amount of dissolved carbonate was observed during the first sets (around 0.3%). Then, the successive experiments seemed to reach a constant value after 24h, which can be called \u2018the minimum dissolution level\u2019. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and carbon are related through their roles in a biofiltration process aimed at treating air polluted by inorganic compounds. The carbonate present in the formulated materials can serve as a carbon source for microorganisms that may utilize ammonia. The study discusses the dissolution rates of carbon and other elements, indicating their potential interactions in the biofiltration system, particularly in the context of microbial activity and nutrient availability.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ammonia and carbon are discussed in relation to their roles in a biofiltration process. While their interaction is mentioned, the specifics of their relationship and the extent of their functional connection are not deeply explored.",
