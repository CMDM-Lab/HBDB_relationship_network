    "context": "However, wood chips present some composting advantages in front of PE such as moisture adjustment and waste stabilization. A typical municipal solid waste treatment plant consists of various different sites, including: a landfill site, leachate pond, tipping floor (area to discharge and classify fresh MSW), and sites for anaerobic digestion of MSW and the composting process. These can be sources of odours. Odours from municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants consist of a complex mixture of organic compounds, hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3). These odours can be an important problem for MSW plant operators and also a source of annoyance to nearby urban populations. The chemical characterization of the emissions from an MSW treatment plant has proven to be helpful in order to determine which compound or group of compounds are characteristic in each of the point sources of the treatment plant. This characterization is fundamental to improve the waste treatment system in order to reduce the odorous emissions (Gallego et al., 2012). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) is identified as one of the components contributing to the odorous emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants, which are described as complex mixtures of various organic compounds and gases. The characterization of these emissions, including ammonia, is crucial for identifying sources of odors and improving waste treatment processes to mitigate these emissions. Thus, ammonia is part of the broader category of complex mixtures that contribute to the odor problem in MSW treatment facilities.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ammonia is specifically mentioned as a component of the complex mixtures of odorous emissions from MSW treatment plants. While their relationship is acknowledged, the context does not delve deeply into the interactions or specific roles of ammonia within these mixtures.",
