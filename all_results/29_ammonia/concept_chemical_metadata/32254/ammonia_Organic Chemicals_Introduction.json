    "context": "Two other terpenes also showed up in the leachate: eucalyptol and camphor. The present work tries to identify the main components in emissions from an MSW treatment plant, considering: biogas leaks from the landfill site, emissions from the leachate pond and the composting site. With this objective, emissions from different sites within the MSW treatment plant were characterized. Based on the concentration of hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and some volatile organic compounds, series of ratios were proposed to characterize each emission. This in return can help to determine the main source of emission within the MSW treatment plant. Description of the studied fractions and the experiments On the MSW treatment plant considered in this study, an anaerobic digester treats the fraction of municipal solid waste consisting of particles smaller than 40mm in size; the products of this anaerobic digestion are biogas and digestate, which make up the solid effluent. There is another site on the MSW treatment plant where the composting is done. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as one of the emissions characterized from a municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plant, alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While ammonia is a type of organic chemical, the relationship is primarily about its presence in emissions rather than a detailed interaction or functional significance with other organic chemicals. The study focuses on identifying sources of emissions rather than exploring the specific roles of ammonia within the broader category of organic chemicals.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ammonia is categorized as an organic chemical and is part of the emissions being studied. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance with other organic chemicals in the context provided.",
        "score": 2
