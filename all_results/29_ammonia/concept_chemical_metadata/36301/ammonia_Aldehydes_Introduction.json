    "context": "As tobacco is only heated during a puff, the EHCSS does not generate side-stream smoke and therefore substantial reductions in ETS concentrations were expected. Clinical exposure studies of the electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS) demonstrated substantial reductions in exposure to several smoke constituents, measured by biomarkers of exposure, in adult smokers who were switched from a conventional cigarette to the EHCSS for eight days in a controlled clinical setting (Roethig et al., 2005, 2007; Frost-P ineda et al., 2008). Previous ETS studies of earlier generations of the EHCSS demonstrated that concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter measured when the EHCSS was smoked were comparable to levels observed when there was no-smoking in the room (Roethig et al., 2005). The purpose of this study was to determine concentrations of ETS markers, as measured by solanesol particulate matter (Sol-PM), fluorescent particulate matter (FPM), ultraviolet particulate matter (UVPM), nicotine, 3-ethenyl pyridine (3-EP), and other air constituents, as measured by respirable suspended particulates (RSP), CO, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) [represented by the aldehyde group of compounds], and ammonia (NH3). Particulate-phase markers included RSP, Sol-PM, FPM and UVPM, while nicotine and 3-EP were included as gas-phase ETS markers. CO, TVOC and ammonia are gas-phase markers that are not specific to ETS. The concentrations were measured in a room in which participants smoked the EHCSS and compared with concentrations measured while subjects smoked conventional cigarettes (CC) and with levels measured during a period of no-smoking.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) and aldehydes are both identified as gas-phase markers measured during the study of exposure to emissions from an electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS). While ammonia is specifically mentioned as a gas-phase marker, aldehydes are represented as part of the total volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The relationship is primarily based on their classification as markers of exposure rather than any direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ammonia and aldehydes are both mentioned as gas-phase markers in the context of tobacco emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific significance beyond their classification.",
        "score": 2
