    "context": "As tobacco is only heated during a puff, the EHCSS does not generate side-stream smoke and therefore substantial reductions in ETS concentrations were expected. Clinical exposure studies of the electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS) demonstrated substantial reductions in exposure to several smoke constituents, measured by biomarkers of exposure, in adult smokers who were switched from a conventional cigarette to the EHCSS for eight days in a controlled clinical setting (Roethig et al., 2005, 2007; Frost-P ineda et al., 2008). Previous ETS studies of earlier generations of the EHCSS demonstrated that concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter measured when the EHCSS was smoked were comparable to levels observed when there was no-smoking in the room (Roethig et al., 2005). The purpose of this study was to determine concentrations of ETS markers, as measured by solanesol particulate matter (Sol-PM), fluorescent particulate matter (FPM), ultraviolet particulate matter (UVPM), nicotine, 3-ethenyl pyridine (3-EP), and other air constituents, as measured by respirable suspended particulates (RSP), CO, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) [represented by the aldehyde group of compounds], and ammonia (NH3). Particulate-phase markers included RSP, Sol-PM, FPM and UVPM, while nicotine and 3-EP were included as gas-phase ETS markers. CO, TVOC and ammonia are gas-phase markers that are not specific to ETS. The concentrations were measured in a room in which participants smoked the EHCSS and compared with concentrations measured while subjects smoked conventional cigarettes (CC) and with levels measured during a period of no-smoking.

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and solanesol are both mentioned as markers of exposure in studies comparing the emissions from electrically heated cigarette smoking systems (EHCSS) to conventional cigarettes. Ammonia is categorized as a gas-phase marker, while solanesol is identified as a particulate-phase marker. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ammonia and solanesol beyond their roles as exposure markers in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ammonia and solanesol are both included in the study as markers of exposure but are not directly related or discussed in terms of their interaction or significance within the context.",
        "score": 2
