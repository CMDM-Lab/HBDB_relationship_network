    "context": "Moreover, there was no a liquid trap installed between vacuum thermal stripping and gas absorption in the laboratory assembly. The foams formed in the stripping flask could be sucked to the acid solution occasionally, resulting in more VOCs detected in the acid solutions, for example, (p-hydroxyphenyl)-phosphoric acid that may not tend to volatilize at the experimental pH 9. VOCs were hence examined again for the acid solutions in the pilot tests. In addition to 4-methylphenol and 4-ethylphenol that were frequently found in the acid solutions in the laboratory stripping experiments, several other VOCs were detected in the ammonia-absorbed acid solutions in the pilot tests with dairy manure digestate, including diethyl sulfate (CAS #64-67-5), phthalic anhydride (CAS #85-44-9), diethyl azelate (CAS #624-17-9), and 2-chlorocyclohexanol (CAS #1561-86-0). Only 4-methylbenzaldehyde and 4-methylphenol were found in the acid solutions upon vacuum thermal stripping of the low-ammonia and high-ammonia foodwaste digestate, respectively, with the pilot system. Nevertheless, no VOCs were detected in the recovered solid products. This further confirms that the crystals are likely marketable as an analytical grade chemical and chemical fertilizer (Tao and Ukwuani, 2015). From both economic and product quality perspectives, direct crystallization in a well-controlled acid solution is the best method to produce ammonium sulfate crystals. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and 4-cresol are mentioned in relation to the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in acid solutions during laboratory experiments involving dairy manure digestate. While ammonia is noted as being absorbed in the acid solutions, 4-cresol (4-methylphenol) is identified as one of the VOCs frequently found. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interaction or specific relationship beyond their presence in the same experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as ammonia and 4-cresol are both mentioned in the context of VOC detection in acid solutions, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or explored beyond their co-occurrence in the study.",
