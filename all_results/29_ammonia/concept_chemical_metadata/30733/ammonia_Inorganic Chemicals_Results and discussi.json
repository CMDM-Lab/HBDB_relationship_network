    "context": "Sulfuric acid is hygroscopic, requiring prolonged drying and absorbing moisture rapidly from the air (APHA et\u00a0al., 2012). Moreover, (NH4)2SO4 may react with H2SO4 to form ammonium bisulfate, (NH4)HSO4, which has a solubility of 115.1\u00a0g/L at 20\u00a0\u00b0C (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/). The (NH4)2SO4 content could be underestimated by Equation (6) for the crystals recovered from stripping of the low-ammonia foodwaste digestate when H2SO4 concentration in the final acid solution was still high that the product of H2SO4 and (NH4)2SO4 concentrations was greater than the solubility product of (NH4)HSO4. Digestate contains volatile organic and inorganic compounds which may be stripped along with ammonia (Resch et\u00a0al., 2011). Volatility of those compounds is dependent on their chemical forms which are often pH dependent and can be affected by temperature and pressure conditions (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2013; Mao et\u00a0al., 2010). At the elevated pH values of digestate fed to a stripper, compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and volatile fatty acids are largely transformed into aqueous species (Tao and Ukwuani, 2015; Laureni et\u00a0al., 2013; Mao et\u00a0al., 2010), rendering little volatilization. Based on excellent match (mass spectral match factor \u2265900), 10 VOCs were identified in the acid solutions after laboratory stripping of dairy manure digestate (Table\u00a04 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned in relation to its presence in digestate, which contains both volatile organic and inorganic compounds. The discussion highlights how ammonia can be stripped along with other compounds during the processing of low-ammonia food waste digestate. While ammonia is an inorganic compound, the context does not delve into specific interactions or detailed relationships between ammonia and the broader category of inorganic chemicals, limiting the depth of their connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ammonia is categorized as an inorganic compound and is mentioned in the context of its presence in digestate. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration or significant interaction, resulting in a low to moderate relevance.",
