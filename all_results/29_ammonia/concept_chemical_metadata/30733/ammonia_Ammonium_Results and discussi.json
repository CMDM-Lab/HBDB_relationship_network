    "context": "The K L values were close to that (37.4\u00a0mm/h) reported by EL-Bourawi et\u00a0al. (2007) for membrane distillation at 49.7\u00a0\u00b0C and 12.4\u00a0kPa. Although the high solids concentration of digestate could decrease K L , vacuum enhances ammonia mass transfer (Chiam and Sarbatly, 2013; Vaddella et\u00a0al., 2013; Ye et\u00a0al., 2008; Arogo et\u00a0al., 1999). High concentrations of suspended solids adsorb ammonia and impede ammonium dissociation (Koirala et\u00a0al., 2014; Vaddella et\u00a0al., 2013; Arogo et\u00a0al., 1999), rendering the higher ammonia saturation concentrations of digestate in this study than filtrate of digestate reported by Tao and Ukwuani (2015). The test results with the pilot system verified the kinetic model of vacuum thermal stripping (Equation (5)) as indicated by a strong correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.95 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) between the measured and simulated concentrations of total ammonia remaining at the end of batch tests (Table\u00a02 ).Effects of boiling point temperature and vacuum on absorption of ammonia Cumulative (NH4)2SO4 formation increased steeply and began to stabilize after 2\u00a0h of vacuum thermal stripping of dairy manure digestate (Fig.\u00a05 a). The differences in final (NH4)2SO4 formation between the 7 boiling conditions were probably related to the differences in initial ammonia concentration although the kinetics of ammonia mass transfer regulated the progressive accumulation of (NH4)2SO4. Ammonia could be absorbed immediately in a dilute sulfuric acid solution (Tao and Ukwuani, 2015). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium are discussed in relation to their behavior during the vacuum thermal stripping of dairy manure digestate. Ammonia is noted for its role in forming ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) during the process, with high concentrations of suspended solids affecting ammonia dissociation and thus influencing the overall dynamics of ammonium formation. The relationship is significant as it highlights the conversion and interaction between ammonia and its ionized form, ammonium, in the context of nutrient recovery from waste.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ammonia and ammonium, as the context discusses their interconversion and the impact of environmental conditions on their behavior. The relationship is supported by quantitative data regarding ammonium sulfate formation, indicating a clear relevance in the context of biochemistry and nutrient management.",
