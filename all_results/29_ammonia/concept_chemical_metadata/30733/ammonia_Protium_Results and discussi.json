The fractions of total ammonia remaining at the beginning of vacuum thermal stripping (or the end of temperature ramping) were similar across the 7 boiling conditions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.66). However, the fractions were significantly higher at stripping temperatures of 50 and 58\u00a0\u00b0C than those at 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C after 1.5\u00a0h of stripping (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01; LSD\u00a0=\u00a00.10) and 3\u00a0h of stripping (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; LSD\u00a0=\u00a00.03), which suggested slower stripping of ammonia at 50\u201358\u00a0\u00b0C than 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C. Similarly, the ammonia mass transfer coefficients (K L ) were significantly smaller at 50\u201358\u00a0\u00b0C than those at 65\u2013100\u00a0\u00b0C (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008; LSD\u00a0=\u00a09.0) as given in Table\u00a01 . The suction effect of vacuum would enhance gas-phase ammonia mass transfer, but it may not improve overall mass transfer any more as vacuum pressure decreases further below 25.1\u00a0kPa. This coincides with earlier studies that ammonia mass transfer coefficient is much more sensitive to a change of air velocity in a lower velocity range than that in a higher velocity range (Ye et\u00a0al., 2008; Arogo et\u00a0al., 1999).

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its concentration and behavior during vacuum thermal stripping of dairy manure digestate, while Protium, a hydrogen isotope, is not directly mentioned or related to the processes described. The focus is on the physical properties and mass transfer of ammonia under varying temperatures and vacuum conditions, with no evident connection to Protium or its implications in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between ammonia and Protium, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other. Protium is not discussed in relation to ammonia's behavior or properties.",
