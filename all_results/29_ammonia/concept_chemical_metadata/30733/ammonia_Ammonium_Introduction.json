    "context": "Meanwhile, a lower vacuum pressure increases free ammonia fraction as shown in Equations (2) and (4). Ammonia saturation concentration changes little with vacuum in the absolute pressure range of 20.0\u2013101.3 kPa (Whitfield, 1974; Salavera et\u00a0al., 2005).

The first objective of this study was to develop boiling point temperature-vacuum curves and investigate how ammonia mass transfer is affected by boiling point temperature and vacuum combinations. To the best of our knowledge, ammonia mass transfer kinetic constants (K L and C s ) have not been reported previously for digestate or wastewater at a reduced pressure as in vacuum thermal stripping. The kinetic constants provide essential data for design and feasibility study of this novel process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium are related through their chemical equilibrium in aqueous solutions, particularly under varying vacuum pressures. The discussion focuses on the fraction of free ammonia (NH3) and its saturation concentration, which is influenced by the presence of ammonium ions (NH4+). The equations provided illustrate the relationship between these two forms of nitrogen, emphasizing their interconversion and the impact of environmental conditions on their concentrations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and ammonium, as the context discusses their equilibrium and the factors affecting their concentrations. The equations provided support this relationship, indicating a clear interaction within the chemical framework.",
