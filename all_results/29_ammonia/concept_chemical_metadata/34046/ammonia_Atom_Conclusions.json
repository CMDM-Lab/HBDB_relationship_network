    "context": "Separately, we examined the response of the NC stretching vibration of 1,4-PDI in the nanogap electrodes under the flow of two typical VOCs, acetic acid and ammonia. In the presence of acetic acid, the NC stretching peak was blue-shifted by up to 8, 3, and 5cm\u22121, respectively, for the Au@1,4-PDI/Au(flat), Ag@1,4-PDI/Au(flat), and Au@1,4-PDI/Ag(flat) systems, while in the presence of ammonia, the NC stretching peak was red-shifted by up to 9, 4, and 5cm\u22121, respectively. The amount of blue- and red-shift was larger for the Au\u2013Au nanogap than the Ag\u2013Au nanogap, suggesting that Au nanoparticles should be affected more by VOCs than Ag nanoparticles. In conformity with the ab initio quantum mechanical calculation, the blue-shift could be understood by assuming that electrons were transferred from Au or Ag nanoparticles to the carbonyl oxygen atom of acetic acid, while the red-shift was caused by the electron donation from ammonia to Au or Ag nanoparticles, thus raising and lowering the surface potential of metal nanoparticles in the presence of acetic acid and ammonia, respectively. The NC stretching band was quite symmetrical even under the flow of VOCs, suggesting that the voltage transmission from Au or Ag nanoparticles to the planar Au or Ag should be as equally probable to that from the planar Au or Ag substrate to the Au or Ag nanoparticles in a nanogap electrode. The ready transmittance must be associated with the conjugation characteristics of 1,4-PDI. The emissions of odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are representative air pollution problems that not only threaten public health, but also deteriorate personal welfare (Yang et al., 2010).

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its effect on the NC stretching vibration of 1,4-PDI in nanogap electrodes. The interaction between ammonia and metal nanoparticles (Au and Ag) is highlighted, where ammonia donates electrons, causing a red-shift in the NC stretching peak. However, the term 'Atom' is not explicitly defined or discussed in relation to ammonia, making the connection between them unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ammonia's interaction with metal nanoparticles is described, but the term 'Atom' lacks a clear contextual relationship with ammonia, limiting the depth of their connection.",
