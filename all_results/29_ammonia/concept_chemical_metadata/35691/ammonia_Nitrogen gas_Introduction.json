    "context": "Another emerging group of works is focused on the importance of gaseous releases towards the occupational and non-occupational exposure to these chemicals and its associated risks, as reported in recently published studies (Tolvanen et al., 2005; Domingo and Nadal, 2009). Important conclusions can be obtained from atmospheric emissions studies. Composting plants present numerous odour and pollution sources, including reception and materials handling, forced aeration composting, stock piling, etc. Gaseous emissions in composting facilities are typically constituted by nitrogen-based compounds, sulphur-based compounds and a wide group of compounds denominated volatile organic compounds (VOC) (Eitzer, 1995). Among the nitrogen-based compounds released to the atmosphere, ammonia has received much attention because it can be easily identified from other composting odours, it often represents the main nitrogen gas emitted during composting and it can be released in large amounts. Reported ammonia emissions in a composting process of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) vary between 18 and 1150g NH3 Mgwaste\u22121 (Clemens and Cuhls, 2003) whereas peaks of ammonia concentration up to 700mg NH3 m\u22123 have been detected in exhaust gases from wastewater sludge composting facilities (Haug, 1993). In studies performed at laboratory level with different wastes it was shown that ammonia emissions exhibit a clear correlation with process temperature, reaching maximum values during the thermophilic period (Pagans et al., 2006a). Aeration rate, pH and initial total ammonium nitrogen are other factors influencing directly ammonia emissions in a composting process (Beck-Friis et al., 2001; Cronje et al., 2002; Grunditz and Dalhammar, 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as a significant nitrogen-based compound emitted during composting processes, often representing the primary nitrogen gas released. The text highlights ammonia's prominence in gaseous emissions from composting facilities, indicating its role as a key nitrogen gas in this environment. The relationship is established through the discussion of ammonia's emissions and its correlation with various composting factors, emphasizing its importance in nitrogen gas dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ammonia and nitrogen gas, as ammonia is explicitly mentioned as a major nitrogen gas emitted during composting. The context provides evidence of ammonia's significance in nitrogen emissions, supported by quantitative data on its release during the composting process.",
