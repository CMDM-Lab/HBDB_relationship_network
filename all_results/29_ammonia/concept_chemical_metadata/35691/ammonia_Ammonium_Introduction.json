    "context": "Among the nitrogen-based compounds released to the atmosphere, ammonia has received much attention because it can be easily identified from other composting odours, it often represents the main nitrogen gas emitted during composting and it can be released in large amounts. Reported ammonia emissions in a composting process of organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW) vary between 18 and 1150g NH3 Mgwaste\u22121 (Clemens and Cuhls, 2003) whereas peaks of ammonia concentration up to 700mg NH3 m\u22123 have been detected in exhaust gases from wastewater sludge composting facilities (Haug, 1993). In studies performed at laboratory level with different wastes it was shown that ammonia emissions exhibit a clear correlation with process temperature, reaching maximum values during the thermophilic period (Pagans et al., 2006a). Aeration rate, pH and initial total ammonium nitrogen are other factors influencing directly ammonia emissions in a composting process (Beck-Friis et al., 2001; Cronje et al., 2002; Grunditz and Dalhammar, 2001). Another main group of gaseous pollutants emitted from composting facilities are VOC. According to Eitzer (1995), who undertook an exhaustive characterization of the different VOC emitted at the different stages of the composting process, most VOC in composting plants are emitted at the early stages of process i.e. at the tipping floors, at the shredder and during the initial forced aeration composting period. Other authors related the presence of some VOC and its concentration to the odour nuisance level (Defoer et al., 2002; Mao et al., 2006). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium are closely related as ammonia (NH3) is the gaseous form of nitrogen that can be emitted during composting, while ammonium (NH4+) is its ionized form that can exist in solution. The discussion highlights ammonia emissions during composting processes, which are influenced by various factors, including temperature and pH, suggesting a direct relationship between the two forms of nitrogen in the context of waste management and environmental impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and ammonium, as the context discusses ammonia emissions and their correlation with factors that also affect ammonium levels in composting. The relationship is clear and relevant to nitrogen cycling in environmental processes.",
