    "context": "The reference compound, formaldehyde (>100ppb) is also well known to cause irritation of eyes, nose, and throat, while being capable of accelerating asthma symptoms and other respiratory illnesses [42\u201344]. In addition, the primary acute effect of inhalation exposure to acetaldehyde includes irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract in humans, while at higher exposure levels, erythema, coughing, pulmonary edema, and necrosis may also occur. In this investigation, we found several charcoals yielded a high concentration of ammonia which exceeded the guideline levels. A recent study revealed that ammonia gas can cause damage, when hydrous ammonia reacts with tissue water to form strongly alkaline solution, ammonium hydroxide. It is a product from an exothermic reaction and can cause significant thermal injury to the skin, eyes, and especially to the respiratory system. According to this study, several odorants (toluene, p-X, S, MEK, AA, PA, IA, and NH3) are often significantly emitted during charcoal combustion and thereby play an important role in odor pollution under certain circumstances. Although emissions of many odorants from different origins were below harmful levels, a few odorants (AA, PA, IA, and NH3) were found to exceed certain guidelines set for odorant emission control. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium hydroxide are closely related through the chemical reaction that occurs when ammonia gas interacts with water. The formation of ammonium hydroxide, a strongly alkaline solution, is highlighted as a significant concern due to its potential to cause severe thermal injuries to tissues, particularly in the respiratory system. This relationship underscores the hazardous nature of ammonia emissions from charcoal combustion, which can exceed safety guidelines and contribute to health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and ammonium hydroxide, as the context discusses the formation of ammonium hydroxide from ammonia and its associated health risks. The relationship is supported by the context's focus on the chemical reaction and its implications for safety.",
