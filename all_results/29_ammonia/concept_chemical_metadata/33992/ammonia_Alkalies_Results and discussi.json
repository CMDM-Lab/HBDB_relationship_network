    "context": "The reference compound, formaldehyde (>100ppb) is also well known to cause irritation of eyes, nose, and throat, while being capable of accelerating asthma symptoms and other respiratory illnesses [42\u201344]. In addition, the primary acute effect of inhalation exposure to acetaldehyde includes irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract in humans, while at higher exposure levels, erythema, coughing, pulmonary edema, and necrosis may also occur. In this investigation, we found several charcoals yielded a high concentration of ammonia which exceeded the guideline levels. A recent study revealed that ammonia gas can cause damage, when hydrous ammonia reacts with tissue water to form strongly alkaline solution, ammonium hydroxide. It is a product from an exothermic reaction and can cause significant thermal injury to the skin, eyes, and especially to the respiratory system. According to this study, several odorants (toluene, p-X, S, MEK, AA, PA, IA, and NH3) are often significantly emitted during charcoal combustion and thereby play an important role in odor pollution under certain circumstances. Although emissions of many odorants from different origins were below harmful levels, a few odorants (AA, PA, IA, and NH3) were found to exceed certain guidelines set for odorant emission control. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its potential to form ammonium hydroxide when it reacts with water, resulting in a strongly alkaline solution. This highlights a direct relationship between ammonia and alkalies, as ammonium hydroxide is a basic compound that can cause significant harm to tissues. The context emphasizes the hazardous effects of ammonia and its alkaline product, linking them through their chemical interactions and implications for health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ammonia and alkalies, as the formation of ammonium hydroxide from ammonia illustrates a clear chemical relationship with health implications. The context provides evidence of ammonia's harmful effects when it reacts to form an alkaline solution.",
