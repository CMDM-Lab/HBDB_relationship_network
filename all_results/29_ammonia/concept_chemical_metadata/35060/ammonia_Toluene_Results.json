    "context": "The amount of hydrogen cyanide formed during the fires is established to be up to 40 times lower than the formed amount of NO x . Levels vary between 0.1 and 3.5gkg\u22121 polyamide. Ammonia was found in lower amounts than HCN (max 0.3gkg\u22121 polyamide). During the first two experiments, the amount of ammonia did not exceed the detection limit (<0.1gkg\u22121).VOC, aldehydes and ketones The major organic compounds that are emitted are the classic BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes) and formaldehyde. Many other aromates and partly oxidized organic substances are formed in lower quantities. In one experiment (experiment 2) benzonitrile was detected (1.5gkg\u22121).Dust and particle bound compounds During the fires dust and soot was formed. The total amounts of emitted dust fluctuated between 2.5 and 5.5gkg\u22121 combustible material. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and toluene are both mentioned as components of emissions from fires involving polyamide materials. However, their relationship is not directly discussed, as ammonia is noted to be present in lower amounts compared to hydrogen cyanide and is not highlighted in relation to toluene or other VOCs. The mention of both compounds occurs within a broader discussion of emitted organic compounds without any specific interaction or functional relationship established between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as ammonia and toluene are merely listed among other compounds emitted during fires, with no direct interaction or relevance to each other discussed in the context.",
