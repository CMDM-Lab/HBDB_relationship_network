    "context": "The amount of hydrogen cyanide formed during the fires is established to be up to 40 times lower than the formed amount of NO x . Levels vary between 0.1 and 3.5gkg\u22121 polyamide. Ammonia was found in lower amounts than HCN (max 0.3gkg\u22121 polyamide). During the first two experiments, the amount of ammonia did not exceed the detection limit (<0.1gkg\u22121).VOC, aldehydes and ketones The major organic compounds that are emitted are the classic BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes) and formaldehyde. Many other aromates and partly oxidized organic substances are formed in lower quantities. In one experiment (experiment 2) benzonitrile was detected (1.5gkg\u22121).Dust and particle bound compounds During the fires dust and soot was formed. The total amounts of emitted dust fluctuated between 2.5 and 5.5gkg\u22121 combustible material. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ketones are both mentioned as products of combustion during fires involving polyamide materials. However, their relationship is not explicitly detailed. Ammonia is noted to be present in lower amounts compared to hydrogen cyanide, while ketones are listed among other organic compounds emitted. There is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between ammonia and ketones.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ammonia and ketones are both mentioned in the context of combustion emissions but without any direct interaction or significant relationship established between them.",
        "score": 2
