    "context": "TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine known to mediate and cause inflammatory reactions. It is noteworthy that the development of granulomatous inflammation in the lungs of patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is associated with activation and accumulation of CD4+ T cells (Fontenot et al., 2002). T cells are activated in the presence of Be antigen and release proinflammatory Th1-type cytokines, mostly TNF-\u03b1, interferon-gamma and IL-2. Experimental studies of immunotoxicity following inhalation exposure in mice showed different pattern of cytokine secretion related to the chemical form of beryllium (Muller et al., 2011). Overall, in this latter study, inhalation of Be metal and Be oxide produces greater pulmonary toxicity than other forms. Although workers of our study were exposed to a low Be concentration, we have shown a relationship between duration and cumulative exposure to poorly soluble Be compounds and the level of TNF-\u03b1 in EBC. In other words, being occupationally exposed on a full time basis during 10 years to an airborne Be concentration of 0.05\u03bcgm\u22123 (the occupational exposure limit proposed by ACGIH in 2010) is associated to an increase of 75% in TNF-\u03b1 in EBC.

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium is linked to immunotoxicity through its role in chronic beryllium disease (CBD), where exposure leads to granulomatous inflammation in the lungs and activation of CD4+ T cells. The release of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1, is associated with beryllium exposure, indicating a clear immunotoxic effect. Experimental studies further support this relationship by demonstrating varying cytokine responses based on the chemical form of beryllium, with certain forms causing greater pulmonary toxicity. The study highlights a significant correlation between occupational exposure duration and increased TNF-\u03b1 levels, underscoring beryllium's immunotoxic potential.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between beryllium and immunotoxicity, as the context provides substantial evidence of beryllium's role in inducing inflammatory responses and cytokine release, particularly TNF-\u03b1, in exposed individuals. This indicates a critical immunotoxic effect linked to beryllium exposure.",
        "score": 5
