    "context": "Unfortunately, beryllium sensitization blood test was not performed and we did not dispose of BeLPT status or personal medical data. The limited availability of laboratories assessing BeLPT in France and medical data confidentiality were the main reasons. Conclusion This pilot study reports several new findings relating biomarkers in EBC of workers in machining industries exposed to low levels of poorly soluble forms of Be. Taken together, the results suggest that machining-related exposure to beryllium seems to be associated to pulmonary inflammation involving TNF-\u03b1. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these results. Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. Funding The study was funded by own funds of our institutions without external financial support. ",

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium is linked to pulmonary inflammation in workers exposed to its poorly soluble forms, suggesting a potential association with respiratory conditions such as pneumonia. The study indicates that exposure to beryllium may trigger inflammatory responses, including the release of TNF-\u03b1, which could contribute to lung-related diseases. However, the direct relationship between beryllium exposure and pneumonia is not explicitly established, necessitating further research to confirm these findings.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as beryllium exposure is associated with pulmonary inflammation, which can lead to pneumonia. However, the context does not provide direct evidence linking beryllium to pneumonia specifically, indicating a need for more detailed studies.",
        "score": 3
