    "context": "[4] decrease in reported exposure over time. [1] Conclusions The constructed JEM successfully differentiated beryllium exposures across jobs and over time. [2] This is the only quantitative JEM containing exposure estimates (average and peak) for the entire plant history. [1] Beryllium and its metallic alloys have been used in a number of industries including aircraft construction, medical devices, and consumer products such as mobile electronic and communication devices, because of beryllium's unique physical properties of excellent thermal conductivity and the highest melting point among light metals. [2] Studies have shown that nearly all forms of beryllium (except beryl and bertrandite ore) have been associated with disease. [3] Quantitative metrics of exposure other than cumulative or weighted averages, such as peak exposures, may play a role in the development of beryllium-related diseases. [1] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) are 2.0 and 0.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2026\u00ce\u00bcg/m3 respectively.

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium is identified as a light metal with unique physical properties, such as excellent thermal conductivity and a high melting point, making it valuable in various industries, including aircraft construction and medical devices. The discussion emphasizes beryllium's classification as a light metal and its associated health risks, linking it to the broader category of light metals due to its specific applications and properties.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between beryllium and light metals, as beryllium is explicitly categorized as a light metal with unique properties. The context provides evidence of its industrial applications and health implications, indicating a clear relationship within the field of materials science.",
