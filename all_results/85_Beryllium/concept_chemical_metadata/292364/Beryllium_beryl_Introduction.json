    "context": "[1] Conclusions The constructed JEM successfully differentiated beryllium exposures across jobs and over time. [2] This is the only quantitative JEM containing exposure estimates (average and peak) for the entire plant history. [1] Beryllium and its metallic alloys have been used in a number of industries including aircraft construction, medical devices, and consumer products such as mobile electronic and communication devices, because of beryllium's unique physical properties of excellent thermal conductivity and the highest melting point among light metals. [2] Studies have shown that nearly all forms of beryllium (except beryl and bertrandite ore) have been associated with disease. [3] Quantitative metrics of exposure other than cumulative or weighted averages, such as peak exposures, may play a role in the development of beryllium-related diseases. [1] The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) are 2.0 and 0.5\u00e2\u20ac\u2026\u00ce\u00bcg/m3 respectively. [2] Beryllium has been designated a group 1 (known human) carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, based partly on findings from a number of retrospective epidemiological studies.

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium and beryl are related as beryl is a mineral form of beryllium. While beryllium is used in various industries due to its unique properties, the text notes that most forms of beryllium, except for beryl and bertrandite ore, are associated with health risks. This indicates a distinction in the safety profile of beryl compared to other beryllium compounds, highlighting its relevance in discussions about beryllium exposure and related diseases.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between beryllium and beryl, as beryl is a mineral form of beryllium that is noted to be less harmful. The context provides evidence of their relationship, particularly in terms of health implications, making it a critical aspect of the discussion.",
        "score": 4
