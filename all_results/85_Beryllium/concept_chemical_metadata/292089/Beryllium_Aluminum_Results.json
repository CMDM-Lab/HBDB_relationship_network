    "context": "There was no significant difference in clinical data (respiratory history and symptoms) between controls and exposed subjects. There were more women in control group (p=0.01). All spirometric indices were above the lower limit of normal and there were no statistically significant differences between exposed group and controls.Assessment of beryllium exposure Exposure matrices were developed for each plant in order to assign levels of exposure to each task. Altogether, 36 specific job tasks were defined for individual exposure reconstruction as following: - Plant A \u2013 eight tasks with exposure to alloy copper-beryllium 2%: lathe work, milling, sanding, electrospark machining, welding, polishing, grinding, manual filling - Plant B \u2013 five tasks with exposure to alloy copper-beryllium 3%: deburring with a clipping tool, etching, wet machining, polishing, assembling - Plant C \u2013 twenty-three tasks with exposure to beryllium metal and alloy aluminum-beryllium 62%, performed with different machines and belonging to the following operations: machining, dry machining, manual scraping, production support operations (maintenance, shipping and receiving, decontamination and cleaning operations, inventory management, waste package, supervision, quality control, machines assistance, workplace sampling and analysis) Due to the confidentiality agreements with the companies, the results of beryllium exposure levels for each task cannot be provided here. The highest Be concentration was measured in plant C on personal air samples collected in 1998 in Be machining workroom (3\u03bcgm\u22123). All the other airborne concentrations of beryllium were below the current French occupational exposure limit value of 2\u03bcgm\u22123. In contrast, a quarter of these concentrations were above the limit value of 0.05\u03bcgm\u22123 proposed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH, 2010). ",

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium and aluminum are mentioned in relation to their presence in specific alloys used in various job tasks at different plants. Beryllium is noted for its exposure levels in tasks involving copper-beryllium and aluminum-beryllium alloys. However, the context does not elaborate on any direct chemical or biological interactions between beryllium and aluminum, focusing instead on exposure assessment and occupational safety.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both beryllium and aluminum are components of alloys mentioned in the context. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions, limiting the relevance.",
