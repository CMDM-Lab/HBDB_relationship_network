    "context": "TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine known to mediate and cause inflammatory reactions. It is noteworthy that the development of granulomatous inflammation in the lungs of patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is associated with activation and accumulation of CD4+ T cells (Fontenot et al., 2002). T cells are activated in the presence of Be antigen and release proinflammatory Th1-type cytokines, mostly TNF-\u03b1, interferon-gamma and IL-2. Experimental studies of immunotoxicity following inhalation exposure in mice showed different pattern of cytokine secretion related to the chemical form of beryllium (Muller et al., 2011). Overall, in this latter study, inhalation of Be metal and Be oxide produces greater pulmonary toxicity than other forms. Although workers of our study were exposed to a low Be concentration, we have shown a relationship between duration and cumulative exposure to poorly soluble Be compounds and the level of TNF-\u03b1 in EBC. In other words, being occupationally exposed on a full time basis during 10 years to an airborne Be concentration of 0.05\u03bcgm\u22123 (the occupational exposure limit proposed by ACGIH in 2010) is associated to an increase of 75% in TNF-\u03b1 in EBC.

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium is discussed as a specific chemical that induces inflammatory responses, particularly in chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The relationship is highlighted through the examination of cytokine release, particularly TNF-\u03b1, in response to different chemical forms of beryllium. The study emphasizes the toxicological effects of beryllium compounds, linking them to immune responses and pulmonary toxicity, thus establishing a clear connection between beryllium as a chemical and its biological impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between beryllium and chemicals, as the context provides evidence of beryllium's role in inducing inflammatory responses and its toxicological effects, supported by experimental studies on different chemical forms of beryllium.",
        "score": 4
