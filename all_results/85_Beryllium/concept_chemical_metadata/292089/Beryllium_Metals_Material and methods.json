    "context": "All the subjects were recruited in 2010\u20132011 and answered an interviewed questionnaire in two parts: - A medical questionnaire to assess medical history and treatment, in particular respiratory health and smoking habits. We used the questionnaire of the European Community for Steel and Coal on respiratory symptoms (Minette, 1989). - A questionnaire to gather occupational history, focusing on the type, the duration and frequency of Be exposed operations as well as occupational exposure to other pneumotoxicants such as aluminum, titan, zirconium, welding fumes, copper, cobalt, antimony, iron, silica, asbestos, oil mist, nickel, chrome, refractory ceramic fibers, chlorine, solvents. Then we collected the following samples in that order: - collection of EBC samples - measurement of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) - spirometric measurements All clinical data were collected during the workshift.Assessment of exposure to beryllium Workers\u2019 exposure to Be was related to machining tasks performed on alloys Cu-Be 2-3% in plants A and B, and on alloy Al-Be 62% and Be metal in plant C. Beryllium exposed operations and tasks were recorded for each of the three plants based on information collected during the plants visits and workstation observations before the subjects\u2019 recruitment. For each Be-exposing task, exposure to Be was assessed using historical plant hygiene data issued from measurements campaigns that were performed in the 3 plants between 1998 and 2011. Using historical air measurements, task-exposure matrices were developed for each plant allowing the estimation of a level of exposure to Be for relevant operations. Inhalable fraction of aerosols taken in personal and area samples were collected at a flow rate of 1 or 2Lmin\u22121 (GilAir \u2122 pumps, Gilian Instrument Corp., West Calwell, N.J.) using 37-mm diameter closed-face cassette (Merck Millipore Billerica, MA, USA) with a 4-mm diameter orifice containing a quartz fiber filter or a cellulose ester membrane (Merck Millipore Billerica, MA, USA).

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium (Be) is discussed as a specific metal that workers are exposed to during machining tasks involving various metal alloys. The study focuses on assessing exposure to beryllium in relation to other metals and pneumotoxicants, indicating that beryllium is categorized within the broader group of metals that can pose respiratory health risks. However, the relationship is primarily about exposure assessment rather than a detailed interaction between beryllium and other metals.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as beryllium is specifically mentioned as a metal and is part of a broader discussion on metal exposure in occupational settings. However, the context does not delve into specific interactions or comparisons between beryllium and other metals.",
