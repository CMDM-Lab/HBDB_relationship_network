    "context": "Biomarkers of local inflammation and oxidative stress \u2013 cytokines, nitric-oxide-related products, arachidonic acid metabolites, hydrogen peroxide, aldehydes \u2013 were reported as potential sensitive endpoints when identifying early biochemical changes in the airways of workers exposed to various pneumotoxic subtances (Ch\u00e9rot et al., 2012). Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator involved in several physiological processes that induces respiratory tract injuries via the interaction of NO with reactive oxygen species resulting in reactive nitrogen intermediates (Sugiura and Ichinose, 2011; Robbins et al., 2000). NO-related products, which are found in EBC, are formed in the airways by oxidation of NO in nitrogen oxides (NOx, namely nitrite and nitrate) (Kub\u00e1\u0148 and Foret, 2013). We recently reported that it was possible to quantify beryllium in the EBC of workers exposed mainly to water soluble forms of beryllium in a primary aluminum production plant (Hulo et al., 2016a,b). We also shown that concentrations of Be in EBC and cumulative beryllium exposure index were significantly correlated. To our knowledge, there have been no published data on exhaled biomarkers to assess respiratory tract effects in workers exposed to beryllium yet. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of occupational exposure to poorly soluble forms of Be on pulmonary inflammation using EBC in workers employed in machining industries.

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium and aluminum are both mentioned in relation to occupational exposure in a primary aluminum production plant. The study focuses on the quantification of beryllium in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of workers, highlighting the potential health effects of beryllium exposure. While aluminum is referenced as part of the production environment, there is no direct discussion of a relationship between beryllium and aluminum in terms of their biochemical interactions or health impacts, making their connection indirect and primarily contextual.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect relationship, as both beryllium and aluminum are associated with occupational exposure in the same context, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other.",
