    "context": "Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of occupational exposure to poorly soluble forms of Be on pulmonary inflammation using EBC in workers employed in machining industries. Study population We conducted an exposed-control study in a population of 20 workers exposed to poorly soluble forms of Be and 16 control subjects. Exposed subjects worked in three French plants (A, B and C) that machined: - low beryllium alloys (copper \u2013 beryllium (Cu-Be) alloys with beryllium content 2% for plant A and 3% for plant B). Eight exposed workers were recruited from plants A and B - high beryllium alloy with aluminum (Al-Be) (beryllium content 62%) and beryllium metal for plant C. Twelve exposed workers were recruited from plant C. Machining operations within the plants consist mainly in lathe work, milling, grinding, deburring, filling, polishing, sanding and electrospark machining. Plants were identified from a French assessment survey of exposure associated with occupational use of Be and its compounds (Vincent et al., 2009) and recruited on a voluntary basis of their management boards. Within each recruited plant, we identified workrooms and workstations with potential exposure to beryllium. All the operators working in these workrooms and workstations were proposed to participate to the study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium and aluminum are related through their presence in specific alloys used in machining industries. The study examines the effects of occupational exposure to poorly soluble forms of beryllium, particularly in alloys that also contain aluminum. The focus is on the health impacts of beryllium exposure, with aluminum being a component of some beryllium alloys, indicating a potential interaction in occupational settings. However, the relationship is primarily centered on beryllium's effects rather than a direct interaction between the two metals.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as beryllium and aluminum are connected through their use in alloys and the study's focus on beryllium exposure. While they are mentioned together, the primary emphasis is on beryllium's health effects rather than a detailed exploration of their interaction.",
