    "context": "TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine known to mediate and cause inflammatory reactions. It is noteworthy that the development of granulomatous inflammation in the lungs of patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is associated with activation and accumulation of CD4+ T cells (Fontenot et al., 2002). T cells are activated in the presence of Be antigen and release proinflammatory Th1-type cytokines, mostly TNF-\u03b1, interferon-gamma and IL-2. Experimental studies of immunotoxicity following inhalation exposure in mice showed different pattern of cytokine secretion related to the chemical form of beryllium (Muller et al., 2011). Overall, in this latter study, inhalation of Be metal and Be oxide produces greater pulmonary toxicity than other forms. Although workers of our study were exposed to a low Be concentration, we have shown a relationship between duration and cumulative exposure to poorly soluble Be compounds and the level of TNF-\u03b1 in EBC. In other words, being occupationally exposed on a full time basis during 10 years to an airborne Be concentration of 0.05\u03bcgm\u22123 (the occupational exposure limit proposed by ACGIH in 2010) is associated to an increase of 75% in TNF-\u03b1 in EBC.

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium exposure is linked to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1, in patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The activation of CD4+ T cells in response to beryllium antigens leads to increased cytokine production, indicating a direct relationship between beryllium exposure and cytokine secretion. Experimental studies further support this connection by demonstrating varying patterns of cytokine secretion based on the chemical form of beryllium, with certain forms causing greater pulmonary toxicity and cytokine release.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context clearly establishes a direct relationship between beryllium exposure and the secretion of cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1, supported by both clinical and experimental evidence.",
        "score": 5
