    "context": "NO-related products, which are found in EBC, are formed in the airways by oxidation of NO in nitrogen oxides (NOx, namely nitrite and nitrate) (Kub\u00e1\u0148 and Foret, 2013). We recently reported that it was possible to quantify beryllium in the EBC of workers exposed mainly to water soluble forms of beryllium in a primary aluminum production plant (Hulo et al., 2016a,b). We also shown that concentrations of Be in EBC and cumulative beryllium exposure index were significantly correlated. To our knowledge, there have been no published data on exhaled biomarkers to assess respiratory tract effects in workers exposed to beryllium yet. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of occupational exposure to poorly soluble forms of Be on pulmonary inflammation using EBC in workers employed in machining industries. Study population We conducted an exposed-control study in a population of 20 workers exposed to poorly soluble forms of Be and 16 control subjects. Exposed subjects worked in three French plants (A, B and C) that machined: - low beryllium alloys (copper \u2013 beryllium (Cu-Be) alloys with beryllium content 2% for plant A and 3% for plant B). ",

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium is analyzed as a potential biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of workers exposed to poorly soluble forms of beryllium in machining industries. The study aims to investigate the correlation between beryllium concentrations in EBC and pulmonary inflammation, highlighting the significance of exhalation as a method for assessing respiratory effects due to beryllium exposure. This suggests a direct relationship between beryllium exposure and its measurable presence in exhaled breath, indicating potential health implications for workers.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between beryllium and exhalation, as the study provides evidence of beryllium quantification in EBC and its correlation with exposure levels, indicating a clear relationship in the context of respiratory health assessment.",
