    "context": "These results can be partly explained by the low occupational exposure of the exposed group. In contrast to spirometric or imaging testing which often indicate late and irreversible lung pathological process related to pneumotoxic species in workplace, the study of inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers in EBC which are likely to reflect the composition of the airway-lining fluid may be useful to assess early lung pathobiology accompanying or preceding inflammation (Mutti and Corradi, 2006). TNF-\u03b1 is a cytokine known to mediate and cause inflammatory reactions. It is noteworthy that the development of granulomatous inflammation in the lungs of patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD) is associated with activation and accumulation of CD4+ T cells (Fontenot et al., 2002). T cells are activated in the presence of Be antigen and release proinflammatory Th1-type cytokines, mostly TNF-\u03b1, interferon-gamma and IL-2. Experimental studies of immunotoxicity following inhalation exposure in mice showed different pattern of cytokine secretion related to the chemical form of beryllium (Muller et al., 2011). Overall, in this latter study, inhalation of Be metal and Be oxide produces greater pulmonary toxicity than other forms. ",

        "summary": "In this context, beryllium is linked to granulomatous inflammation through its role in chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The presence of beryllium antigens activates CD4+ T cells, which release proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, leading to the development of granulomatous inflammation in the lungs. This relationship highlights the immunotoxic effects of beryllium exposure and its association with lung pathobiology.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between beryllium and granulomatous inflammation, as the context explicitly discusses how beryllium exposure leads to immune activation and subsequent inflammatory responses in the lungs, supported by specific cytokine involvement.",
