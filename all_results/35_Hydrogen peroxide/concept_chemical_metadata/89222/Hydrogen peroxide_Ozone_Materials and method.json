    "context": "The filled reactors were distributed equidistant around the UV lamp (at 4cm) and the reactor area belonging to gas phase was covered with aluminium foil in order to avoid the UV oxidation of the VSC in gas phase during the experiments. A reactor was taken off from the container every two minutes and the concentration of VSC was determined as explained in analytical procedures. Triplicate experiments were carried out at 15\u00b0C and at free pH (6.7\u00b10.2). In order to compare the oxidative efficiency of the studied treatments, the same molar concentration of both hydrogen peroxide and ozone (0.20mM) was used. This corresponds to the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide needed for the complete oxidation of the synthetic multicomponent solution. The influence of hydrogen peroxide concentration (0.2\u20134mM) in the VSC oxidation was tested with UV/H2O2 treatment. In the Fenton treatment (H2O2/Fe2+), the effect of Fe2+ concentration (0.004\u20130.018mM) was also studied. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide and ozone are both evaluated for their oxidative efficiency in treating volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) under controlled experimental conditions. The study compares the effects of equal molar concentrations of both oxidants, indicating their potential roles in oxidation processes. However, the specific interactions or comparative effectiveness between hydrogen peroxide and ozone are not deeply explored beyond their use in the same experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both hydrogen peroxide and ozone are used in the same experimental context to assess oxidative efficiency, indicating a relationship in their application. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or comparative effectiveness.",
