    "context": "One of the main causes of malodour episodes in these facilities is the emission of volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs), especially in the sludge management areas (Dincer and Muezzinoglu, 2008). One of the most extended treatments for the removal of odourous compounds, especially VSCs, is the use of oxidative wet scrubbers using hypochlorite (Van Durme et al., 1992; Kastner et al., 2003; Sanchez et al., 2006; Vilmain et al., 2013). However, the formation of chlorinated by-products in the oxidative process has been reported as a negative aspect by several authors (Myslinski et al., 2000; Lin and Chang, 2005). Thus, other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (Charron et al., 2004; Couvert et al., 2006; Biard et al., 2009) and ozone (Hwang et al., 1994; Biard et al., 2009), which can promote advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), have been tested. Gaseous VSC removal integrating AOPs with wet scrubbers involves mass transfer with simultaneous reaction due to the generation of highly reactive oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals. These radicals have a higher oxidation potential (2.8eV) than other oxidising species such as hydrogen peroxide or chlorine (1.78 and 1.36eV, respectively) (Metcalf, 2003). Because the VSC concentration in the liquid phase decreases as it is degraded, VSC mass transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase is expected to be continuous (Tokumura et al., 2012). ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide and ozone are both discussed as alternative oxidants for the removal of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in odour treatment processes. They are mentioned in relation to advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that generate highly reactive oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals, which are effective in degrading VSCs. The text highlights their roles in promoting oxidation, suggesting a functional relationship in the context of environmental remediation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between hydrogen peroxide and ozone, as both are presented as effective oxidants in the same treatment process for VSCs. Their roles in advanced oxidation processes indicate a clear relationship, supported by the context of their application in odour removal.",
