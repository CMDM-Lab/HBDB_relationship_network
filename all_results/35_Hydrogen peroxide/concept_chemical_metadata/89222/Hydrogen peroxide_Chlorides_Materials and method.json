    "context": "This study was focused on the use of UV/H2O2, H2O2/Fe2+, UV/H2O2/Fe2+ and O3 at mild conditions (room temperature and pressure and pH around neutral). A comparative assessment regarding the oxidation efficiency and the total cost of each treatment was carried out. Chemicals All sulphur compounds used in this study (ETM, DMS and DMDS) were supplied by Acros Organics (Belgium) and Merck (Germany) with purities higher than 99%. Fenton and photo-Fenton oxidation were carried out using iron chloride (FeCl2\u22c54H2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) of 30% (w/w) purchased from Panreac and Scharlau (Spain), respectively.Experimental setup The experimental set-up, shown in Fig. SM-1 of supplementary material (SM), was used in all oxidation experiments. The steel container can hold up to 6 cylindrical quartz reactors (diameter=1.8cm; height=17.5cm) which are magnetically stirred and is equipped with a thermostatic bath. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is utilized as an oxidizing agent in various treatment methods, including Fenton and photo-Fenton oxidation, which involve iron chloride (FeCl2). While chlorides are mentioned in relation to the use of iron chloride, there is no direct discussion of their interaction with hydrogen peroxide or their role in the oxidation processes. The focus remains on the efficiency of oxidation treatments rather than a specific relationship between H2O2 and chlorides.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both hydrogen peroxide and chlorides are involved in oxidation processes, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or explored in the context provided.",
