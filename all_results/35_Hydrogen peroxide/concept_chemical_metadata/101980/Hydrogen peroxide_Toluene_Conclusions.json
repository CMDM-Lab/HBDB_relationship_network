    "context": "The heterogeneous gas\u2013liquid photocatalytic oxidation of toluene gas involves gas\u2013liquid mass transfer with simultaneous reaction. The photo-Fenton reaction in the liquid-phase could improve the overall toluene absorption rate due to the increase in the driving force for mass transfer. The effect of the inlet toluene gas concentration on the toluene degradation rate has been examined. The toluene concentrations in the inlet gas concentrations were varied in the range from 0.0968 to 8.69gm\u22123 with initial hydrogen peroxide concentration of 400mgl\u22121 and Fe dose of 5.0mgl\u22121. It was found that toluene in the inlet gas was almost completely dissolved into water and degraded in the liquid-phase for the toluene gas dose of less than 0.42gm\u22123. It should be emphasized that the higher toluene gas dose may applicable with increasing the concentrations of Fenton reagents, Fe and H2O2. By continuous addition of H2O2 make-up solution to compensate for the reacted amount, the toluene gas degradation process by the photo-Fenton reaction could be operated continuously. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is utilized as a reagent in the photo-Fenton reaction to enhance the degradation of toluene gas in a heterogeneous gas-liquid photocatalytic oxidation process. The study indicates that the presence of H2O2 improves the overall absorption and degradation rates of toluene, suggesting a direct and significant role of hydrogen peroxide in facilitating the breakdown of toluene in the liquid phase during the reaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between hydrogen peroxide and toluene, as H2O2 is a critical reagent that enhances the degradation of toluene in the described photocatalytic process, demonstrating a clear functional interaction.",
        "score": 5
