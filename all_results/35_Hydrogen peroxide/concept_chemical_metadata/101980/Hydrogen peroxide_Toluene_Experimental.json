    "context": "Using sulfuric acid the solution pH was adjusted to 3.0, which is the optimal value for the photo-Fenton reactions (Tokumura et al., 2006). All experiments were carried out without adding any buffers for pH adjustments during the degradation process. The doses of hydrogen peroxide and Fe,  C H 2 O 2 , 0 and C Fe0, were 400 and 5.0mgl\u22121, respectively. It should be noted, as mentioned below, that for the continuous toluene treatment, hydrogen peroxide which is consumed by the photo-Fenton reaction has to be continuously supplied to the liquid-phase. In this study, however, in order to examine the kinetics and dynamics of photo-Fenton reaction in the liquid-phase the operation was batch and continuous with respect to liquid- and gas-phase, respectively. Reagent grade hydrogen peroxide (30% solution), iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4 \u00b77H2O), sulfuric acid were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. (Japan). Toluene used as an example of VOCs in effluent gas was 99.5% (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan). ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized in a photo-Fenton reaction to treat toluene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) present in effluent gas. The study emphasizes the need for continuous supply of hydrogen peroxide during the degradation process of toluene, indicating a direct chemical interaction where hydrogen peroxide acts as a reagent to facilitate the breakdown of toluene in the liquid phase.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between hydrogen peroxide and toluene, as hydrogen peroxide is actively used in the degradation of toluene through a specific chemical reaction. The context provides clear evidence of their interaction in a treatment process, although it does not delve into quantitative data.",
