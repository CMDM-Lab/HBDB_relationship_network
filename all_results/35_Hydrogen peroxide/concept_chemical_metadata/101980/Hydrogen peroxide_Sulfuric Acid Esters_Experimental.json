    "context": "The doses of hydrogen peroxide and Fe,  C H 2 O 2 , 0 and C Fe0, were 400 and 5.0mgl\u22121, respectively. It should be noted, as mentioned below, that for the continuous toluene treatment, hydrogen peroxide which is consumed by the photo-Fenton reaction has to be continuously supplied to the liquid-phase. In this study, however, in order to examine the kinetics and dynamics of photo-Fenton reaction in the liquid-phase the operation was batch and continuous with respect to liquid- and gas-phase, respectively. Reagent grade hydrogen peroxide (30% solution), iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4 \u00b77H2O), sulfuric acid were purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc. (Japan). Toluene used as an example of VOCs in effluent gas was 99.5% (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Japan). Photo-Fenton degradation reactions were started by addition of known amount of H2O2 and injection of gas effluent containing toluene to water including iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate as a source of iron with UV light irradiation. At the beginning of degradation process, therefore, water in the photoreactor contained no toluene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a reagent in the photo-Fenton reaction, which involves the degradation of toluene in the presence of iron(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid is mentioned as a reagent, its specific role in relation to hydrogen peroxide is not detailed. The focus is primarily on the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with iron and toluene rather than a direct relationship with sulfuric acid esters.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid are used in the same chemical process (photo-Fenton reaction), but their specific interactions or functional relationships are not elaborated upon in the context.",
        "score": 2
