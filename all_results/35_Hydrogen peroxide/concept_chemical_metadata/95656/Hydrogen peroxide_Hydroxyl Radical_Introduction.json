    "context": "These observations demonstrated that both direct (molecular ozone attack) and indirect reactions (HO\u00b0, generated by O3 decomposition, attack) were potentially involved in the mechanism. Toward a deeper description and comprehension of the transfer mechanisms, which could enable to generalise these results to other VOCs, several information were missing. Indeed, the kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 and the stoichiometric coefficient (\u03b3) of the direct reaction could not be found in the available literature whereas the kinetic constant with HO\u00b0 is well known (Buxton et al., 1988): (2) | \u03b3 | O 3 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / O 3 = ? Products (3) HO \u00b0 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / HO \u00b0 =\u00d7 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 Products Moreover, the average hydroxyl radical concentration in the scrubber between the inlet and the outlet and its evolution depending on the chemical conditions (pH, ozone and hydrogen peroxide concentrations) were unknown. The kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 will be determined by using the competitive kinetic method. The average HO\u00b0 concentration in the scrubber will be measured using para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a HO\u00b0 tracer. The knowledge of these parameters will enable to calculate relevant parameters such as the mass transfer enhancement factors using O3 and the peroxone process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is indirectly related to hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) through their roles in chemical reactions involving ozone (O3) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The generation of hydroxyl radicals is mentioned as a consequence of ozone decomposition, which can also involve hydrogen peroxide. The study aims to understand the kinetics of these reactions, highlighting the significance of both species in oxidative processes, although their direct interaction is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals are connected through their involvement in oxidative reactions and the study's focus on their roles in the context of ozone and VOCs. However, the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored.",
