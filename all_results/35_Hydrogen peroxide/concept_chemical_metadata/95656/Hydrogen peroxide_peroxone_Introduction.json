    "context": "However, due to its poor stability, the HO\u00b0 concentration in water is usually low (in the range 10\u221210 to 10\u221212 M) which counterbalances its high reactivity. Consequently, using AOPs, the HO\u00b0 formation is mostly the rate-limiting step (Beltr\u00e1n, 1997). In the peroxone process (O3/H2O2), HO\u00b0 are involved in a chain cycle (Glaze and Kang, 1989; Acero and Von Gunten, 2000) which is initiated by the fast decomposition of dissolved ozone by the hydroperoxide anion  HO 2 - (Staehelin and Hoigne, 1982, 1985; Buehler et al., 1984; Staehelin et al., 1984), the conjugated base of H2O2 (pKa=11.8): (1) H 2 O - + O 3 \u2192 k 1 =\u00d7 10 6 M - 1 s - 1 O 2 + HO \u00b0 + O 2 \u00b0 - The application of the peroxone process in a continuous operation showed that dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) mass transfer was improved when ozone was previously dissolved at pH 8 in water and mixed with a solution of hydrogen peroxide directly in the scrubber (Biard et al., 2009a). The peroxone process was more efficient than a simple ozonation only when a restrictive H2O2-to-O3 inlet concentrations ratio ( F H 2 O 2 / F O 3 ) ranging between 1 and 2molmol\u22121 was implemented. These observations demonstrated that both direct (molecular ozone attack) and indirect reactions (HO\u00b0, generated by O3 decomposition, attack) were potentially involved in the mechanism. Toward a deeper description and comprehension of the transfer mechanisms, which could enable to generalise these results to other VOCs, several information were missing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key component of the peroxone process, which involves the simultaneous use of ozone (O3) and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The interaction between H2O2 and O3 leads to the formation of HO\u00b0, which are crucial for the oxidative degradation of pollutants. The efficiency of the peroxone process is influenced by the ratio of H2O2 to O3, indicating a significant and direct relationship between these two substances in enhancing the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as hydrogen peroxide is directly involved in the peroxone process, which is essential for generating reactive species that facilitate pollutant degradation. The context provides clear evidence of their interdependence and the importance of their ratio in optimizing the process.",
