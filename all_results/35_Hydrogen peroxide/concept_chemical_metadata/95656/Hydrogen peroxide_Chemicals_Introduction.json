    "context": "These observations demonstrated that both direct (molecular ozone attack) and indirect reactions (HO\u00b0, generated by O3 decomposition, attack) were potentially involved in the mechanism. Toward a deeper description and comprehension of the transfer mechanisms, which could enable to generalise these results to other VOCs, several information were missing. Indeed, the kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 and the stoichiometric coefficient (\u03b3) of the direct reaction could not be found in the available literature whereas the kinetic constant with HO\u00b0 is well known (Buxton et al., 1988): (2) | \u03b3 | O 3 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / O 3 = ? Products (3) HO \u00b0 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / HO \u00b0 =\u00d7 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 Products Moreover, the average hydroxyl radical concentration in the scrubber between the inlet and the outlet and its evolution depending on the chemical conditions (pH, ozone and hydrogen peroxide concentrations) were unknown. The kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 will be determined by using the competitive kinetic method. The average HO\u00b0 concentration in the scrubber will be measured using para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a HO\u00b0 tracer. The knowledge of these parameters will enable to calculate relevant parameters such as the mass transfer enhancement factors using O3 and the peroxone process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is mentioned as a chemical involved in reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) in the study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship is primarily focused on the chemical interactions and kinetics involving hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals, particularly in the context of their roles in oxidation processes. However, the specific interactions of hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals are not detailed, indicating a broader chemical context rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as hydrogen peroxide is part of a broader discussion on chemical reactions involving ozone and hydroxyl radicals, but there is no detailed exploration of its specific interactions with other chemicals.",
