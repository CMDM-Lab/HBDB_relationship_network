    "context": "These observations demonstrated that both direct (molecular ozone attack) and indirect reactions (HO\u00b0, generated by O3 decomposition, attack) were potentially involved in the mechanism. Toward a deeper description and comprehension of the transfer mechanisms, which could enable to generalise these results to other VOCs, several information were missing. Indeed, the kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 and the stoichiometric coefficient (\u03b3) of the direct reaction could not be found in the available literature whereas the kinetic constant with HO\u00b0 is well known (Buxton et al., 1988): (2) | \u03b3 | O 3 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / O 3 = ? Products (3) HO \u00b0 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / HO \u00b0 =\u00d7 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 Products Moreover, the average hydroxyl radical concentration in the scrubber between the inlet and the outlet and its evolution depending on the chemical conditions (pH, ozone and hydrogen peroxide concentrations) were unknown. The kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 will be determined by using the competitive kinetic method. The average HO\u00b0 concentration in the scrubber will be measured using para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a HO\u00b0 tracer. The knowledge of these parameters will enable to calculate relevant parameters such as the mass transfer enhancement factors using O3 and the peroxone process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide and ozone are discussed in relation to their roles in chemical reactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Ozone is noted for its direct molecular attack and its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) through decomposition, which can subsequently react with other compounds. The study aims to understand the kinetic constants and mechanisms of these reactions, indicating a significant interaction between ozone and hydrogen peroxide in the context of oxidative processes and pollutant degradation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between hydrogen peroxide and ozone, as both are involved in oxidative reactions and the study aims to elucidate their interactions in the context of VOC degradation. The mention of kinetic constants and reaction mechanisms supports this relationship.",
