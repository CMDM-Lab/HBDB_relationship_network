    "context": " [1] To test this hypothesis, we measured systemic hydrogen peroxide production in leaves using a chemical staining method .  [2] We chose the second leaf for this analysis because we observed a severe decrease in the viability of second leaf in M202 at 7 d after submergence compared with M202(Sub1) .  [3] We monitored hydrogen peroxide production corresponding to red-brown colors in M202(Sub1) and M202 at 0, 1, 6, and 14 d after submergence (Supplemental Fig. S4).  [4] Results of the hydrogen peroxide measurement assays after short-term submergence (1 d) were similar between M202(Sub1) and M202 (Supplemental Fig. S4).  [5] However, the effect of prolonged submergence challenges (6 or 14 d) was detrimental to M202.  [6] Thus, hydrogen peroxide is higher in leaves of M202 at 6 d after submergence compared with M202(Sub1) (Supplemental Fig. S4).  [7] The effect is dependent on the duration of submergence (Supplemental Fig. S4). ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is specifically measured as a systemic product in leaves, while peroxides refer to a broader class of compounds that includes hydrogen peroxide. The study highlights the production of hydrogen peroxide in response to submergence stress, indicating its role as a reactive oxygen species. However, the relationship is primarily focused on hydrogen peroxide without detailed exploration of other peroxides, suggesting a direct but limited connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as hydrogen peroxide is a specific type of peroxide being studied in the context of plant stress responses. While they are related, the focus is mainly on hydrogen peroxide without extensive discussion of other peroxides.",
        "score": 3
