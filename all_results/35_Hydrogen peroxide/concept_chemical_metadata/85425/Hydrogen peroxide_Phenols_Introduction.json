    "context": "However, and even if microbial degradation of chlorophenols was reported by several authors as an efficient cost effective method (Field and Sierra-Alvarez, 2008), chlorophenols at high concentration could be inhibitory for a wide range of microorganisms (Marsolek et\u00a0al., 2006). During the last decade, more attention has been paid to the use of enzymes as potential catalysts for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds including phenolic compounds (Kirk et\u00a0al., 2002). As catalysts in aqueous phase, enzymes like peroxidases have been used since decades in emerging process of wastewater charged in phenolic compounds (Bansal and Kanwar, 2013; Bayramo\u011flu and Ar\u0131ca, 2008; Nazari et\u00a0al., 2007). Enzymatic treatment using peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide as a co-substrate was proposed in the early 1980s as an alternative treatment, which is highly selective and efficient for removing phenols from aqueous solutions (Klibanov et\u00a0al., 1980). Enzymatic polymerization offers the advantages of low process energy requirements as well as low solubility of the polymerized product. The use of organic solvents as reaction media can also greatly expand the repertoire of enzyme-catalysed transformations. In order to overcome the denaturing effect of organic solvents on enzymes, methods such as enzyme cross-linking were developed (Sheldon et\u00a0al., 2006). ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is mentioned as a co-substrate used alongside peroxidases in enzymatic treatments for the degradation of phenolic compounds in wastewater. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and peroxidases enhances the efficiency of removing phenols, indicating a significant functional relationship where hydrogen peroxide acts as a catalyst in the enzymatic breakdown of phenolic pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between hydrogen peroxide and phenols, as the context discusses their combined use in enzymatic treatments for phenolic degradation, supported by historical references to their effectiveness in wastewater management.",
