    "context": "The reaction solution containing 3.9\u00a0mL of 50\u00a0mM sodium phosphate buffer pH\u00a0=\u00a07.0 and 4.05\u00a0\u03bcL of guaiacol (98%) was mixed with 2\u00a0mg of CLEAs or 90\u00a0\u03bcL of crude peroxidase. 5\u00a0\u03bcL of hydrogen peroxide (0.8\u00a0M) was then added quickly to initiate the reaction. The colour development was monitored at 470\u00a0nm using Shimadzu UV\u2013VIS spectrophotometer (model UV mini-1240 with a molar extinction coefficient value of 4279\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0cm\u22121) (Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, France). One unit (1.0\u00a0U) of peroxidase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme protein that catalyses the oxidation of 1.0\u00a0\u03bcmol of hydrogen peroxide per min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and pH\u00a0=\u00a07.Analytical method The 2-CP concentrations in the gas phase and in silicone oil were determined using gas chromatography (GC- thermo Focus) equipped with aflame ionisation detector (FID), using an RTx\u22121column (15\u00a0m\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.32\u00a0mm) with 0.25\u00a0\u03bcm thickness of film. The chromatographic operating conditions are as follows: high-purity nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 21\u00a0ml\u00a0min\u22121. Detector temperature was 202\u00a0\u00b0C. Injector temperatures were 140\u00a0\u00b0C for the gas phase and 220\u00a0\u00b0C in the case of silicone oil, while oven temperatures were maintained at 120\u00a0\u00b0C and 140\u00a0\u00b0C for the gas phase and silicone oil respectively.Partition coefficient determination In order to evaluate the capacity of silicone oil to absorb 2-CP, liquid/air partition coefficients of 2-CP in pure water and silicone oil (Rhodorsil\u00ae 47V20) were determined at 25\u00a0\u00b0C using a static method (Darracq et\u00a0al., 2010, 2012; Dumont et\u00a0al., 2010).

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a substrate in a peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation reaction. The addition of hydrogen peroxide initiates the oxidation process, which is monitored through color development. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, indicating a direct relationship where hydrogen peroxide acts as a key oxidizing agent in biochemical reactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as hydrogen peroxide is directly involved in the oxidation process facilitated by peroxidase. The context clearly describes the role of hydrogen peroxide in catalyzing oxidation, establishing a critical relationship between the two terms.",
