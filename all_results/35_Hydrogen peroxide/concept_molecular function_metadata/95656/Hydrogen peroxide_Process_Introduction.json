    "context": "However, due to its poor stability, the HO\u00b0 concentration in water is usually low (in the range 10\u221210 to 10\u221212 M) which counterbalances its high reactivity. Consequently, using AOPs, the HO\u00b0 formation is mostly the rate-limiting step (Beltr\u00e1n, 1997). In the peroxone process (O3/H2O2), HO\u00b0 are involved in a chain cycle (Glaze and Kang, 1989; Acero and Von Gunten, 2000) which is initiated by the fast decomposition of dissolved ozone by the hydroperoxide anion  HO 2 - (Staehelin and Hoigne, 1982, 1985; Buehler et al., 1984; Staehelin et al., 1984), the conjugated base of H2O2 (pKa=11.8): (1) H 2 O - + O 3 \u2192 k 1 =\u00d7 10 6 M - 1 s - 1 O 2 + HO \u00b0 + O 2 \u00b0 - The application of the peroxone process in a continuous operation showed that dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) mass transfer was improved when ozone was previously dissolved at pH 8 in water and mixed with a solution of hydrogen peroxide directly in the scrubber (Biard et al., 2009a). The peroxone process was more efficient than a simple ozonation only when a restrictive H2O2-to-O3 inlet concentrations ratio ( F H 2 O 2 / F O 3 ) ranging between 1 and 2molmol\u22121 was implemented. These observations demonstrated that both direct (molecular ozone attack) and indirect reactions (HO\u00b0, generated by O3 decomposition, attack) were potentially involved in the mechanism. Toward a deeper description and comprehension of the transfer mechanisms, which could enable to generalise these results to other VOCs, several information were missing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is integral to the peroxone process, which combines ozone (O3) and H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The efficiency of this process is influenced by the ratio of H2O2 to O3, highlighting its critical role in enhancing the reaction mechanisms involved in pollutant degradation. The relationship is characterized by H2O2's function as a reactant that facilitates the formation of reactive species necessary for the process to occur effectively.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between hydrogen peroxide and the peroxone process, supported by evidence of its role in generating hydroxyl radicals and improving mass transfer efficiency. The context provides quantitative details about the optimal ratios and mechanisms involved, indicating a strong relationship.",
