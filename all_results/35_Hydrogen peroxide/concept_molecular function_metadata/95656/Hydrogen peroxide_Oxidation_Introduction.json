    "context": "Moreover, in contactors operating co-currently, the Number of Transfer Units is equal to one with a possible saturation of the scrubbing liquid in the absence of VOC degradation after reaching the Height of a Transfer Units (HTU). To increase both the mass transfer kinetics and the absorption capacity, a fast chemical reaction is required to improve mass transfer in the liquid and to consume the targeted VOC (Perry and Green, 1997). Acidic or basic reactions are possible candidates to increase the apparent VOC solubility but this solution is not universal. In a previous paper, the opportunity of using hydroxyl radical HO\u00b0 as a fast chemical oxidant using the ozone/hydrogen peroxide based advanced oxidation process (AOP) was investigated (Biard et al., 2010). This oxidant is a priori a perfect candidate considering its high reactivity and low selectivity with all the VOCs (Munter, 2001; Lobo and Ried, 2008). However, due to its poor stability, the HO\u00b0 concentration in water is usually low (in the range 10\u221210 to 10\u221212 M) which counterbalances its high reactivity. Consequently, using AOPs, the HO\u00b0 formation is mostly the rate-limiting step (Beltr\u00e1n, 1997). ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as a component of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that utilize hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The high reactivity of hydrogen peroxide makes it a suitable oxidant for enhancing mass transfer and degradation of VOCs, indicating a direct relationship between hydrogen peroxide and oxidation processes. The text highlights the role of hydrogen peroxide in facilitating oxidation reactions, particularly in the context of improving VOC solubility and degradation efficiency.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between hydrogen peroxide and oxidation, as hydrogen peroxide is explicitly mentioned as a key oxidant in AOPs aimed at enhancing the oxidation of VOCs. The context provides evidence of its role in facilitating these reactions, although it does not delve deeply into quantitative data.",
