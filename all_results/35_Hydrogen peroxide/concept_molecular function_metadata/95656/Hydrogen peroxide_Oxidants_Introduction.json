    "context": "Moreover, in contactors operating co-currently, the Number of Transfer Units is equal to one with a possible saturation of the scrubbing liquid in the absence of VOC degradation after reaching the Height of a Transfer Units (HTU). To increase both the mass transfer kinetics and the absorption capacity, a fast chemical reaction is required to improve mass transfer in the liquid and to consume the targeted VOC (Perry and Green, 1997). Acidic or basic reactions are possible candidates to increase the apparent VOC solubility but this solution is not universal. In a previous paper, the opportunity of using hydroxyl radical HO\u00b0 as a fast chemical oxidant using the ozone/hydrogen peroxide based advanced oxidation process (AOP) was investigated (Biard et al., 2010). This oxidant is a priori a perfect candidate considering its high reactivity and low selectivity with all the VOCs (Munter, 2001; Lobo and Ried, 2008). However, due to its poor stability, the HO\u00b0 concentration in water is usually low (in the range 10\u221210 to 10\u221212 M) which counterbalances its high reactivity. Consequently, using AOPs, the HO\u00b0 formation is mostly the rate-limiting step (Beltr\u00e1n, 1997). ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as a precursor in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0), which are classified as oxidants. The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) involving hydrogen peroxide aims to enhance the reactivity and efficiency of oxidants in degrading volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship highlights hydrogen peroxide's role in producing powerful oxidants that can facilitate chemical reactions for VOC removal, although its stability poses challenges in practical applications.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between hydrogen peroxide and oxidants, as hydrogen peroxide is utilized to generate hydroxyl radicals, which are key oxidants in advanced oxidation processes. The context provides evidence of their interaction in the degradation of VOCs, indicating a clear functional relationship.",
