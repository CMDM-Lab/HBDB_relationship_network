    "context": "These observations demonstrated that both direct (molecular ozone attack) and indirect reactions (HO\u00b0, generated by O3 decomposition, attack) were potentially involved in the mechanism. Toward a deeper description and comprehension of the transfer mechanisms, which could enable to generalise these results to other VOCs, several information were missing. Indeed, the kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 and the stoichiometric coefficient (\u03b3) of the direct reaction could not be found in the available literature whereas the kinetic constant with HO\u00b0 is well known (Buxton et al., 1988): (2) | \u03b3 | O 3 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / O 3 = ? Products (3) HO \u00b0 + DMDS \u2192 k DMDS / HO \u00b0 =\u00d7 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 Products Moreover, the average hydroxyl radical concentration in the scrubber between the inlet and the outlet and its evolution depending on the chemical conditions (pH, ozone and hydrogen peroxide concentrations) were unknown. The kinetic constant  k DMDS / O 3 will be determined by using the competitive kinetic method. The average HO\u00b0 concentration in the scrubber will be measured using para-chlorobenzoic acid (pCBA) as a HO\u00b0 tracer. The knowledge of these parameters will enable to calculate relevant parameters such as the mass transfer enhancement factors using O3 and the peroxone process. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is mentioned in relation to its role in chemical reactions involving hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) generated from ozone decomposition. However, the term 'evolution' is not explicitly defined or connected to hydrogen peroxide in a biological or chemical sense. The discussion focuses on the kinetics of reactions rather than any evolutionary implications or biological evolution related to hydrogen peroxide.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as hydrogen peroxide is involved in chemical reactions that may have broader implications, but there is no detailed discussion linking it to the concept of evolution in a biological context.",
