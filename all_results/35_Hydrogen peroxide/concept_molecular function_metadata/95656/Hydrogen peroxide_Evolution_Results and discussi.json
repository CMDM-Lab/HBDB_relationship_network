It is also convenient to introduce the Rct and the logarithmic average ozone concentration, which can be calculated since the O3 concentration is measured at the inlet and the outlet: (28) - ln C pCBA outlet C pCBA t inlet = k pCBA/HO \u00b0 R ct \u222b t inlet t outlet C O 3 d t \u2248 k pCBA / HO \u00b0 \u03c4 R ct C O 3 inlet - C O 3 outlet ln C O 3 inlet / C O 3 outlet Consequently, both Rct and  C HO \u00b0 \u00af can be deduced by Eqs. (27) and (28) providing an efficient tool to estimate the potential of the peroxone process. Fig. 5 a and b presents respectively the evolution of  C HO \u00b0 ,L \u00af and Rct versus the inlet hydrogen peroxide concentration ( C H 2 O 2 ,L inlet ) for different ozone concentrations at the inlet of the scrubber ( C O 3 ,L inlet ) at an optimal pH of 8. The results demonstrate a radical generation yield ( C HO \u00b0 ,L \u00af \u224810\u22128 M\u22121 s\u22121 and Rct \u224810\u22124) significantly higher than those usually observed ( C HO \u00b0 ,L \u00af \u224810\u221212\u201310\u221210 M\u22121 s\u22121 and Rct \u224810\u22128). Buffle et al. (2006) showed that during the first 350ms of fast ozone decomposition, the kinetics follows a power-law. Consequently,  C HO \u00b0 ,L \u00af and Rct were larger than those expected by extrapolation considering a first order decomposition. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed in relation to its role in the peroxone process, which involves the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HO\u00b0) through the interaction of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The evolution of HO\u00b0 concentration and the reaction kinetics are analyzed, indicating that the presence of hydrogen peroxide significantly enhances radical generation, which is crucial for various chemical processes. However, the term 'evolution' here primarily refers to the changes in concentration and reaction rates rather than a biological or evolutionary context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as hydrogen peroxide is linked to the evolution of hydroxyl radicals in the context of chemical reactions, but the term 'evolution' does not imply a direct biological or evolutionary relationship.",
