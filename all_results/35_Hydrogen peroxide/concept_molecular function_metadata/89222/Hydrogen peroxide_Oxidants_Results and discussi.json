As it is observed, the oxidation percentage of the mentioned compounds is similar, what is in agreement with the published reaction rate constants of DMS and DMDS with hydroxyl radicals  ( K DMS / OH =\u00d7 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 and K DMDS / OH =\u00d7 10 10 M - 1 s - 1 ) . The hydrogen peroxide consumption was around 43% at the end of the reaction (0.086mM) which is a concentration around 2 times lower than the stoichiometric amount needed for the complete oxidation of the multicomponent VSCs mixture (Table 1 ). On the other hand, different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (0.20, 2.00 and 4.00mM) were tested in order to study the influence of the oxidant concentration in the treatment (Fig. 2 A). Higher oxidation percentages were obtained as the hydrogen peroxide concentration was increased up to 2mM. The highest concentration of hydrogen peroxide (4mM) did not cause significant improvement either in the oxidation rate or the oxidation percentages at the end of treatments. These results are explained by an excessive hydrogen peroxide concentration which scavenges the radicals according to the Eq. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed as an oxidant used in reactions to oxidize volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). The study indicates that varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide influence the oxidation rates, with higher concentrations leading to increased oxidation percentages. This suggests that hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidant in chemical reactions, highlighting its role in oxidation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between hydrogen peroxide and oxidants, as the context provides evidence of H2O2's role as an oxidant in oxidation reactions, supported by quantitative data on its effectiveness at different concentrations.",
