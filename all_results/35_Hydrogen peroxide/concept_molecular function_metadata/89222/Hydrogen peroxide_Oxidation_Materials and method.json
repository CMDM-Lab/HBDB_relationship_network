    "context": "Triplicate experiments were carried out at 15\u00b0C and at free pH (6.7\u00b10.2). In order to compare the oxidative efficiency of the studied treatments, the same molar concentration of both hydrogen peroxide and ozone (0.20mM) was used. This corresponds to the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide needed for the complete oxidation of the synthetic multicomponent solution. The influence of hydrogen peroxide concentration (0.2\u20134mM) in the VSC oxidation was tested with UV/H2O2 treatment. In the Fenton treatment (H2O2/Fe2+), the effect of Fe2+ concentration (0.004\u20130.018mM) was also studied. In the Fenton treatment, the reactors were covered with aluminium foil to avoid the incidence of the natural light during the reaction. Photo-Fenton treatment was performed in a similar way as Fenton treatment but in the presence of UV light and without aluminium foil covering the liquid phase. ",
