    "context": "However, the formation of chlorinated by-products in the oxidative process has been reported as a negative aspect by several authors (Myslinski et al., 2000; Lin and Chang, 2005). Thus, other oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (Charron et al., 2004; Couvert et al., 2006; Biard et al., 2009) and ozone (Hwang et al., 1994; Biard et al., 2009), which can promote advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), have been tested. Gaseous VSC removal integrating AOPs with wet scrubbers involves mass transfer with simultaneous reaction due to the generation of highly reactive oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals. These radicals have a higher oxidation potential (2.8eV) than other oxidising species such as hydrogen peroxide or chlorine (1.78 and 1.36eV, respectively) (Metcalf, 2003). Because the VSC concentration in the liquid phase decreases as it is degraded, VSC mass transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase is expected to be continuous (Tokumura et al., 2012). The reported studies about coupling AOPs with wet scrubbers have been mainly focused on the removal of chlorinated solvents (Dewulf et al., 2001; Feitz et al., 2002) and aromatic compounds (Tokumura et al., 2012). Concerning sulphur compounds, the coupling of wet scrubber with AOPs has been limited to photocatalysis with TiO2 (Liu et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2012) and the use of O3/H2O2 (Biard et al., 2009, 2011).

        "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as an oxidant that can promote advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). It is compared to other oxidizing agents, such as ozone and chlorine, in terms of oxidation potential. The text highlights the role of hydrogen peroxide in oxidation reactions, particularly in the removal of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) through AOPs, indicating its significance in oxidative processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between hydrogen peroxide and oxidation, as hydrogen peroxide is explicitly mentioned as an oxidant involved in AOPs, demonstrating its role in oxidation reactions. The context provides comparative data on oxidation potentials, supporting the relevance of hydrogen peroxide in oxidative processes.",
