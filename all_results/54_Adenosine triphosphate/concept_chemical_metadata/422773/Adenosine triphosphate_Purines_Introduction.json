    "context": "In fact, most of the early studies of purinergic signalling were focused on the autonomic nervous system and were largely concerned with rapid signalling in neurotransmission (for review, see Ref.). Several years later ATP was proposed to act as a cotransmitter with \u2018classical\u2019 transmitters in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves (for review, see Ref.). Now it is firmly established that ATP is used either as a sole transmitter or cotransmitter by many neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Receptors for purines and pyrimidines were cloned and characterized in the 1990s; four subtypes of G-protein-coupled P1 (adenosine) receptors, seven subtypes of ionotropic P2X receptor subunits (which form homomeric or heteromeric channels) and eight subtypes of G-protein-coupled metabotropic P2Y receptors for ATP have been identified. Apart from a release of ATP by damaged or dying cells, physiological release of ATP from both neuronal and non-neuronal cells can be triggered by various stimuli. Several mechanisms of ATP release have been described that include the involvement of vesicular exocytosis, connexin and/or pannexin hemichannels, maxi anion and P2X7 channels. In the extracellular space ATP is rapidly broken down by ectonucleotidases to ADP, AMP and adenosine. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as a key purine nucleotide involved in purinergic signaling within the nervous system. ATP functions as both a neurotransmitter and a cotransmitter, highlighting its critical role in the signaling pathways associated with purines. The breakdown of ATP into other purines like ADP and AMP further emphasizes its relationship with the purine family, as these metabolites are integral to various physiological processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and purines, as ATP is a primary member of the purine family and plays a significant role in purinergic signaling, supported by detailed contextual information.",
        "score": 5
