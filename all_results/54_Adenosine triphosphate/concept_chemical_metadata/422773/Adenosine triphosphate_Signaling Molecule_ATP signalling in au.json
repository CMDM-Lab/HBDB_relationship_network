    "context": "Both systems consist of central neuronal circuits controlling cholinergic preganglionic CNS neurons, which, in turn, innervate autonomic ganglia, glands and peripheral semi-autonomous neural networks such as the enteric nervous system (ENS). The latter is now considered by some to be a third division of the autonomic nervous system. ATP-mediated purinergic signalling seems to have an important role in the operation of the autonomic nervous system at multiple steps of the reflex pathways, from the transduction of sensory information to neuroeffector transmission. ATP signalling in autonomic neuroeffector transmission There is considerable evidence that ATP has an important role as a signalling molecule of NANC nerves found in the respiratory, cardiovascular and urogenital systems, and in the gastrointestinal tract. In the late 1960s many substances were examined as putative transmitters in the NANC nerves of the gastrointestinal tract and bladder, but the substance that best satisfied criteria for function as a neurotransmitter was ATP. Nerves utilizing ATP as their principal transmitter were subsequently named \u2018purinergic\u2019. ATP is released together with noradrenaline (NA) from sympathetic nerves supplying various peripheral targets (Figure 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as a crucial signaling molecule involved in purinergic signaling within the autonomic nervous system. ATP plays a significant role in neuroeffector transmission across various systems, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal functions. It is recognized as a principal neurotransmitter in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves, highlighting its importance in mediating communication between neurons and target tissues.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and its role as a signaling molecule, supported by substantial evidence of its function in neuroeffector transmission and its classification as a neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system.",
        "score": 5
