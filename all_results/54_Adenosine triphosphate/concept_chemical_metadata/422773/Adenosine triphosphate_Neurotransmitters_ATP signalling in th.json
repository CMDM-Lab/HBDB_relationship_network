    "context": "Purinergic modulation of AH-type neurons (their name comes from prolonged and substantial afterhyperpolarizing potentials that follow action potentials) is largely adenosine mediated; when accumulating spontaneously or applied experimentally, adenosine suppresses slow EPSPs in AH neurons. In S neurons (S stands for synaptic, given that these neurons exhibit large amplitude synaptic potentials when their inputs are stimulated), which can be musculomotor, secretomotor or interneurons, adenosine evokes slow EPSP-like excitatory responses mediated via A2A receptors. Adenosine is also responsible for most presynaptic inhibitory actions in the ENS. Interestingly, adenosine is not responsible for presynaptic inhibition at synaptic terminals where ATP is acting as a neurotransmitter; slow EPSPs in submucosal secretomotor neurons, which are mediated by ATP acting at P2Y1 receptors, are not suppressed by activation of adenosine receptors. The P2Y1 purinergic receptor is expressed in the circular muscle coat of the human colon and the guinea pig ileum. ATP released from ENS inhibitory musculomotor neurons acts via the P2Y1 receptor to suppress contractile activity of the circular muscle of both [50\u201352]. ATP is also co-released with ACh from neurons in the myenteric plexus that project and synapse with secretomotor neurons in the submucosal plexus. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a neurotransmitter involved in the modulation of enteric neurons, specifically influencing slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in submucosal secretomotor neurons via P2Y1 receptors. While adenosine mediates inhibitory effects, ATP acts as a neurotransmitter that can evoke excitatory responses, indicating a complex interplay between ATP and other neurotransmitters in the enteric nervous system (ENS). This relationship underscores the role of ATP in neurotransmission and its significance in neuronal signaling.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and neurotransmitters, as ATP is explicitly described as a neurotransmitter with specific roles in neuronal signaling and modulation. The context provides evidence of ATP's function in the ENS, indicating a clear relationship.",
