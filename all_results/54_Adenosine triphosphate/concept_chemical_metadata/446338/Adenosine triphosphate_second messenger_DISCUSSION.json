    "context": "[2] For example, mitochondria were shown to accumulate at the IS and to regulate store-operated Ca2+ signaling by buffering inflowing Ca2+ ions, thus preventing termination of Ca2+ signaling . [3] Our current findings extend this concept by showing that mitochondria can regulate Ca2+ signaling at the IS by fueling purinergic signaling mechanisms that facilitate sustained Ca2+ influx in a P2X receptor-mediated fashion. [4] Our novel concept that mitochondria pump ATP into the IS extends previous reports that the mitochondrial fission factor DRP-1 positions mitochondria to the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) of the IS and regulates mitochondrial ATP production near the IS . [1] Several other reports have suggested that mitochondria-derived ROS, the byproducts of mitochondrial ATP production, function as secondary messengers that are necessary for T cell activation . [2] Recently, Sena et al. reported that ROS specifically generated at complex III of the electron transport chain are required for activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and subsequent induction of IL-2 and proliferation in CD4+ T cells. [3] The authors also showed that ROS production depends on Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake . [4] Taken together with these findings, our results indicate that mitochondrial ROS as well as ATP production have important roles in T cell activation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule produced by mitochondria that plays a significant role in purinergic signaling mechanisms, which facilitate sustained calcium influx in immune cells. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during ATP production, are described as secondary messengers necessary for T cell activation. This indicates a direct relationship where ATP and ROS function together in signaling pathways critical for immune responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ATP and its role as a second messenger, particularly in the context of T cell activation and calcium signaling. The evidence presented supports the importance of ATP in these signaling processes, although the term 'second messenger' is more commonly associated with molecules like cAMP or calcium itself.",
