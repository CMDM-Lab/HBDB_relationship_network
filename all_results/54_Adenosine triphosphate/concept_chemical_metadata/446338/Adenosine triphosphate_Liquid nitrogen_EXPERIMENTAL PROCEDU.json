    "context": "[2] Leukocyte-rich plasma was obtained at the day of diagnosis immediately after blood draw by spontaneous sedimentation (1 \u00c3\u2014 g) over Ficoll-Paque Plus for 30 min at 37 \u00c2\u00b0C. [3] All studies involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board of BIDMC, and written informed consent was obtained. [1] Jurkat cells or purified CD4+ T cells (5 \u00c3\u2014 105) were treated with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG; 20 mm), CCCP (10 \u00ce\u00bcm) or oligomycin (10 \u00ce\u00bcm), or stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads (2 beads/cell) for the indicated periods of time, and intracellular ATP concentrations or ATP in the cell-free supernatant were determined using an ATP Bioluminescence HS II assay kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of samples after etheno-derivatization of adenine compounds as previously described . [2] For the assessment of intracellular ATP concentrations, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, sonicated in the presence of 0.4 m perchloric acid, and analyzed by HPLC. [1] The membrane-bound ATP probe 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) and the intracellular ATP probe 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) were a generous gift of Drs. [2] Kurishita and Hamachi (Kyoto University). [3] Binding of ATP and other polyphosphate compounds to these probes causes a shift in their fluorescence properties. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is analyzed in relation to its intracellular concentrations, which are assessed after cells are snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The use of liquid nitrogen is crucial for preserving the cellular state and preventing degradation of ATP during the analysis process. Thus, while ATP and liquid nitrogen are not directly related in function, liquid nitrogen plays a vital role in the preservation and accurate measurement of ATP levels in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection, as liquid nitrogen is essential for preserving ATP integrity during analysis. The context provides evidence of this relationship through the methodology described, indicating that liquid nitrogen is critical for accurate ATP measurement.",
