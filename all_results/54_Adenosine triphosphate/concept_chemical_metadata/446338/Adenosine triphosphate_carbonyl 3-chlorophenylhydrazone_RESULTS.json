    "context": "[9] Taken together our results indicate that T cell stimulation triggers virtually instantaneous ATP release, which is fueled by equally rapid processes that increase intracellular ATP concentrations. [1] Mammalian cells can generate ATP by phosphorylation of ADP in the glycolysis pathway, which takes place in the cytosol or by the ATP synthase that is driven by the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. [2] We wondered how these distinct processes contribute to ATP formation in T cells and which of these processes is responsible for the rapid intracellular ATP production that leads to the ATP release we observed during T cell activation. [3] We treated Jurkat cells and primary CD4+ T cells with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) in order to block glycolysis or with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) or oligomycin to inhibit mitochondrial ATP production (Fig. 2, A and B). [4] While 2-DG reduced intracellular ATP levels by 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c50% in both cell types, inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production had no effect on intracellular ATP concentrations in Jurkat cells indicating that Jurkat cells, which are leukemia cells, rely mainly on glycolytic metabolism, which is a characteristic feature of cancer cells (Fig. 2A). [5] By contrast, inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production markedly reduced intracellular ATP levels in unstimulated primary CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2B). [6] Interestingly, however, CCCP inhibited the increase in ATP production and the release of ATP in response to the stimulation of Jurkat cells (Fig. 2, C and D). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is central to the energy metabolism of T cells, particularly during activation. Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) is used to inhibit mitochondrial ATP production, allowing researchers to assess the contribution of glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation to ATP levels. The results indicate that Jurkat cells primarily rely on glycolysis for ATP production, while CCCP affects ATP release during T cell stimulation, highlighting the interplay between ATP generation pathways in immune cell function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and CCCP, as the context discusses how CCCP impacts ATP production and release in T cells, providing evidence of their interaction in cellular metabolism.",
