[4] MT, MitoTracker; scale bars, 5 \u00ce\u00bcm. [5] C and D, Jurkat cells were treated or not (control) with CBX (20 \u00ce\u00bcm) or latrunculin B (10 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) for 20 min. [6] ATP concentrations in the supernatant (C) or inside the cells (D) were determined after stimulation for 1 min with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads. [7] Data shown are means \u00c2\u00b1 S.D. (n = 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c8); *, p < 0.05. [1] IS formation and mitochondrial translocation are actin cytoskeleton-dependent processes . [2] Latrunculin B, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, markedly reduced the release of ATP from cells stimulated with beads. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is assessed in Jurkat cells during immune synapse formation, particularly in relation to stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads. The CD28 gene product is crucial for T cell activation, and its engagement leads to ATP release, indicating a functional relationship where CD28 signaling influences ATP dynamics in immune responses. However, the specific role of the CD28 gene in ATP release is not deeply explored in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and the CD28 gene, as ATP release is linked to CD28-mediated T cell activation. The context provides evidence of this relationship through experimental data, although the exact mechanisms are not fully detailed.",
