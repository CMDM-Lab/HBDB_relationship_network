    "context": "[1] Eligible patients were patients presenting to the Emergency Department of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) aged 18 years or older who were clinically diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock (classified according to the criteria of the ACCP/SCCM consensus conference, ). [2] Leukocyte-rich plasma was obtained at the day of diagnosis immediately after blood draw by spontaneous sedimentation (1 \u00c3\u2014 g) over Ficoll-Paque Plus for 30 min at 37 \u00c2\u00b0C. [3] All studies involving human subjects were approved by the Institutional Review Board of BIDMC, and written informed consent was obtained. [1] Jurkat cells or purified CD4+ T cells (5 \u00c3\u2014 105) were treated with 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG; 20 mm), CCCP (10 \u00ce\u00bcm) or oligomycin (10 \u00ce\u00bcm), or stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads (2 beads/cell) for the indicated periods of time, and intracellular ATP concentrations or ATP in the cell-free supernatant were determined using an ATP Bioluminescence HS II assay kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of samples after etheno-derivatization of adenine compounds as previously described . [2] For the assessment of intracellular ATP concentrations, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, sonicated in the presence of 0.4 m perchloric acid, and analyzed by HPLC. [1] The membrane-bound ATP probe 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) and the intracellular ATP probe 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) were a generous gift of Drs. [2] Kurishita and Hamachi (Kyoto University). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is measured in Jurkat cells or CD4+ T cells that are stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads. The CD28 gene is crucial for T cell activation, and its stimulation is linked to increased ATP production, indicating a relationship between ATP levels and T cell activation through CD28 signaling. However, the context does not provide detailed insights into the specific mechanisms or quantitative relationships between ATP and the CD28 gene.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ATP levels are assessed in the context of CD28 stimulation, indicating a connection between energy metabolism and T cell activation. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of the underlying mechanisms.",
