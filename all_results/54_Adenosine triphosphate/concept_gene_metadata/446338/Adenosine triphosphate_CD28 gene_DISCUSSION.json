    "context": "[3] ATP in the IS then stimulates P2X receptors that function as ATP-gated Ca2+ channels and facilitate Ca2+ influx. [4] These inside-out/outside-in feedback loops escalate mitochondrial ATP production, thereby amplifying TCR/CD28 signaling and sustaining Ca2+ influx through P2X receptors. [1] Proposed model of the regulation of Ca2+ and purinergic signaling by mitochondrial firing. [2] TCR/CD28 stimulation triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, resulting in mitochondrial Ca2+ firing and ATP production that feeds autocrine purinergic signaling and prolonged Ca2+ influx via P2X1 and P2X4 receptors at the immune synapse. [1] Impairments of these interconnected signaling processes can inhibit T cell function and cause immunosuppression . [2] Critical care patients are particularly prone to such complications, which increases their risk of developing nosocomial infections and sepsis . [3] It has long been known that patients with severe trauma or burn injuries are unable to appropriately generate IL-2 in response to T cell stimulation  and that Ca2+ homeostasis in T cells is affected .

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in T cell signaling, particularly in relation to the CD28 gene. ATP stimulates P2X receptors, facilitating calcium influx that amplifies T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 signaling. This interaction is essential for sustaining T cell function and preventing immunosuppression, highlighting the importance of ATP in modulating the effects of CD28 during immune responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and the CD28 gene, as ATP is integral to enhancing CD28 signaling and T cell activation. The context provides evidence of their interaction in immune signaling pathways, although it does not delve into specific quantitative data.",
        "score": 4
