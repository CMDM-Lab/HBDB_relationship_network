    "context": "[1] As expected from its ATPase activity, the RHDV \u00ce\u201d2C protein was also able to efficiently bind ATP, as indicated by the major labeled band observed (Fig. 3B) corresponding to the mobility of recombinant GST-\u00ce\u201d2C protein. [2] The radioactive label was efficiently competed by the presence of 1 mM unlabeled ATP, GTP, dATP, or dGTP in the incubation medium. [3] In the presence of 1 mM CTP, UTP, dCTP, or dTTP, only small amounts of ADP-protein complexes could still be observed, indicating a lower binding capacity for the RHDV \u00ce\u201d2C protein. [1] In order to investigate the contribution of the A, B, and C conserved motifs to ATP binding and hydrolysis by the \u00ce\u201d2C polypeptide, we performed a limited number of site-directed mutagenesis experiments. [2] Highly conserved amino acid residues were chosen as targets for mutagenesis, and the residues that were introduced (replacing those naturally occurring in RHDV) could be classified into two groups. [3] The first group included changes to residues that were never found at the corresponding position in other NTP-binding proteins , such as mutations G522I and T529A in domain A, D566L in motif B, and K600Q in the conserved C sequence. [4] The second type of mutants included amino acid changes to residues similar to those found at the equivalent positions of 2C-like proteins of picornaviruses, such as T529S in region A and E567D in the B motif.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to the RHDV \u03942C polypeptide, which exhibits ATPase activity and binds ATP. The study investigates how specific conserved motifs within the polypeptide contribute to ATP binding and hydrolysis, indicating a direct functional relationship between ATP and the polypeptide's activity. The mutagenesis experiments aim to elucidate the role of certain amino acid residues in this process, highlighting the significance of polypeptides in ATP interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and polypeptides, as the context provides evidence of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the RHDV \u03942C polypeptide, supported by experimental mutagenesis data. This indicates a clear functional relationship.",
