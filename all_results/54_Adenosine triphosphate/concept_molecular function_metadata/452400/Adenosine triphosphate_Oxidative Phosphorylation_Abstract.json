    "context": "[2] Under hypoxia, on the other hand, respiration and ATP supply are restricted. [3] Under these conditions of oxygen limitation, any compromise in the coupling of oxidative phosphorylation to oxygen consumption could accentuate ATP depletion, leading to metabolic failure. [4] To address this issue, we have developed the approach of oxygen-injection microcalorimetry and ADP-injection respirometry for evaluating mitochondrial function at limiting oxygen supply. [5] Whereas phosphorylation efficiency drops during ADP limitation at high oxygen levels, we show here that oxidative phosphorylation is more efficient at low oxygen than at air saturation, as indicated by higher ratios of ADP flux to total oxygen flux at identical submaximal rates of ATP synthesis. [6] At low oxygen, the proton leak and uncoupled respiration are depressed, thus reducing maintenance energy expenditure. [7] This indicates the importance of low intracellular oxygen levels in avoiding oxidative stress and protecting bioenergetic efficiency.  [1] Atmospheric oxygen levels were probably 0.1% of the present when mitochondria became associated with cells early during evolution (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly linked to oxidative phosphorylation, which is the process by which ATP is produced in mitochondria during aerobic respiration. The text discusses how ATP supply is affected under hypoxic conditions, emphasizing the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in maintaining ATP levels even when oxygen is limited. The efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is highlighted, showing its critical role in ATP synthesis and bioenergetic efficiency, particularly under varying oxygen levels.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between ATP and oxidative phosphorylation, as the context explicitly discusses how ATP production is reliant on the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, especially under conditions of oxygen limitation.",
