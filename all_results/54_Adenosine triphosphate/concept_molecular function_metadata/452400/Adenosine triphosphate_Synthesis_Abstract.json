    "context": "[2] Under hypoxia, on the other hand, respiration and ATP supply are restricted. [3] Under these conditions of oxygen limitation, any compromise in the coupling of oxidative phosphorylation to oxygen consumption could accentuate ATP depletion, leading to metabolic failure. [4] To address this issue, we have developed the approach of oxygen-injection microcalorimetry and ADP-injection respirometry for evaluating mitochondrial function at limiting oxygen supply. [5] Whereas phosphorylation efficiency drops during ADP limitation at high oxygen levels, we show here that oxidative phosphorylation is more efficient at low oxygen than at air saturation, as indicated by higher ratios of ADP flux to total oxygen flux at identical submaximal rates of ATP synthesis. [6] At low oxygen, the proton leak and uncoupled respiration are depressed, thus reducing maintenance energy expenditure. [7] This indicates the importance of low intracellular oxygen levels in avoiding oxidative stress and protecting bioenergetic efficiency.  [1] Atmospheric oxygen levels were probably 0.1% of the present when mitochondria became associated with cells early during evolution (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is central to the synthesis of energy through oxidative phosphorylation, particularly under varying oxygen conditions. The discussion highlights how ATP synthesis efficiency is influenced by oxygen availability, with lower oxygen levels enhancing the coupling of oxidative phosphorylation, thereby optimizing ATP production. This underscores the critical role of ATP synthesis in cellular metabolism and energy management during hypoxic conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and synthesis, as the context discusses how ATP synthesis is affected by oxygen levels and metabolic conditions, providing evidence of their interrelationship in bioenergetics.",
