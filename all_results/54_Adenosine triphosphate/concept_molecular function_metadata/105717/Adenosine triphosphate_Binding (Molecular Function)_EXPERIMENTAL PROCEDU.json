    "context": " [8] Therefore, the nonspecific background was usually estimated by averaging the small heats at the end of the titration.  [9] Raw data were collected, corrected for ligand heats of dilution, and integrated using the Microcal Origin software supplied with the instrument. [10] Since protein concentration was expressed on a subunit basis, a single-site binding model was fit to the data by a nonlinear regression analysis to yield binding constants (K B), enthalpies of binding (\u00ce\u201dH), and stoichiometry of binding. [1] High performance liquid chromatography was used for concentration determination of thymidine and ATP in the final ligand solutions and to monitor potential phosphorylation products during calorimetric experiments using a modified protocol of a previously published method . [2] Nucleotides were determined by reverse-phase ion-paired chromatography using a C18 column (LiChrospher 100 RP-18, 5 \u00ce\u00bcm, 250 \u00c3\u2014 4 mm; Merck) in 0.2m NaH2PO4, 25 mmtetrabutylammonium, 3% (v/v) methanol at 1.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. [3] Ligand concentrations were calculated by means of calibration curves from standard solutions showing linearity in the range of <0.04 to at least 2 mm. [4] The detection limit for dT, dTMP, and ATP was <20 nmol . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is mentioned as a ligand in binding studies, where its concentration is determined alongside other nucleotides. The binding of ATP to proteins is a critical molecular function, as it often serves as an energy source or signaling molecule in various biochemical processes. However, the specific binding interactions or mechanisms involving ATP are not detailed in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ATP is involved in binding studies, indicating its role in molecular functions. However, the context lacks detailed discussion on the specific binding interactions or significance of ATP in relation to binding, limiting the strength of their connection.",
