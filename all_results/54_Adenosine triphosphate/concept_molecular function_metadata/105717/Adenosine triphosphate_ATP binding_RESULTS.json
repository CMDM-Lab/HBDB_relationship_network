    "context": "[3] \u00ce\u201dCp scales with the amount and type of surface buried in the complex according to the equation,  Equation 2where \u00ce\u201dASA represents the apolar (ap) and polar (pol) surface buried in the complex, and \u00ce\u201dC represents the elementary contributions per \u00c3\u20262 of apolar and polar surface to the heat capacity and enthalpy changes . [1] Since there are no structural data available for HSV1 TK in the ligand-free state, to estimate \u00ce\u201dASA, one may remove dT and ATP from the crystal structure of the ternary complex to obtain \u00ce\u201dASA. [2] The buried surface area calculated in this way corresponds to a rigid body binding model in which no conformational changes take place when dT and ATP bind. [3] As seen in TableII, \u00ce\u201dASA totcalculated for the rigid body model was on the order of \u00e2\u02c6\u2019600 to \u00e2\u02c6\u2019800 \u00c3\u20262 for both dT binding and ATP binding. [4] However, values of \u00ce\u201dCp calculated by Equation 2 using the rigid body values of \u00ce\u201dASA were much smaller than \u00ce\u201dCp determined by experiment (\u00ce\u201dCp calc and \u00ce\u201dCp exp in Table II).  [1] The calorimetric titrations presented here provide a comprehensive description of the energetics of substrate binding to HSV1 TK.  [2] Substrate binding is strictly ordered. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding to the enzyme HSV1 thymidine kinase (TK). The analysis involves calculating the buried surface area (\u00ce\u201dASA) during ATP binding, indicating a focus on the energetics and structural aspects of how ATP interacts with the enzyme. The study emphasizes the importance of ATP binding in the context of substrate interactions, suggesting a direct relationship between ATP and its binding dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and ATP binding, as the context discusses the energetics and structural calculations related to ATP's interaction with HSV1 TK, indicating a clear relationship supported by experimental data.",
