    "context": "[2] Since changes in the atomic interactions are similar in protein folding and in binding reactions involving proteins , thermodynamic parameters of protein-protein, peptide-protein, and small ligand-protein interactions can be related to changes in solvent-accessible surface in the same way . [3] \u00ce\u201dCp scales with the amount and type of surface buried in the complex according to the equation,  Equation 2where \u00ce\u201dASA represents the apolar (ap) and polar (pol) surface buried in the complex, and \u00ce\u201dC represents the elementary contributions per \u00c3\u20262 of apolar and polar surface to the heat capacity and enthalpy changes . [1] Since there are no structural data available for HSV1 TK in the ligand-free state, to estimate \u00ce\u201dASA, one may remove dT and ATP from the crystal structure of the ternary complex to obtain \u00ce\u201dASA. [2] The buried surface area calculated in this way corresponds to a rigid body binding model in which no conformational changes take place when dT and ATP bind. [3] As seen in TableII, \u00ce\u201dASA totcalculated for the rigid body model was on the order of \u00e2\u02c6\u2019600 to \u00e2\u02c6\u2019800 \u00c3\u20262 for both dT binding and ATP binding. [4] However, values of \u00ce\u201dCp calculated by Equation 2 using the rigid body values of \u00ce\u201dASA were much smaller than \u00ce\u201dCp determined by experiment (\u00ce\u201dCp calc and \u00ce\u201dCp exp in Table II).  [1] The calorimetric titrations presented here provide a comprehensive description of the energetics of substrate binding to HSV1 TK. ",
