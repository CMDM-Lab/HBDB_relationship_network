    "context": "[12] While these considerations remain speculative before the structure of substrate-free HSV1 TK is known, recent crystallographic studies of adenylate kinases, to which the viral thymidine kinase is homologous, have indeed demonstrated major changes induced by substrate binding in the NMPbind domains and the LID domains as well as small changes in the CORE domains . [1] This is the first report providing a comprehensive thermodynamic description of substrate and cofactor binding to HSV1 TK, a representative of the large family of nucleotide and nucleoside kinases. [2] The results obtained by titration microcalorimetry reveal an extreme case of positive heterotropic interaction. [3] Formation of a binary complex of thymidine with HSV1 TK is a stringent prerequisite for ATP binding. [4] Since the ATP binding site is in fact generated by thymidine binding, one would expect the enzyme to undergo considerable conformational rearrangements. [5] This has been supported by the analysis of the observed heat capacity changes, which were large and negative and indicated burial of molecular surface to an extent much larger than expected if the substrate binding sites preexisted on the apoenzyme and no rearrangement would occur (rigid body binding model). [6] The findings support the view that substrate binding to HSV1 TK leads to a conformational closing of the substrate binding sites to bring thymidine and ATP into an orientation appropriate for catalysis.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly related to ATP binding through its role as a substrate for the viral thymidine kinase (HSV1 TK). The binding of thymidine to HSV1 TK is a prerequisite for ATP binding, indicating that the conformational changes in the enzyme upon substrate binding facilitate the proper orientation of ATP for catalysis. This highlights a critical interaction where ATP binding is contingent upon the prior binding of thymidine, demonstrating a significant relationship between the two terms in the context of enzyme activity.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP binding is explicitly dependent on the prior binding of thymidine to HSV1 TK, indicating a critical and direct relationship supported by the thermodynamic and structural changes described in the context.",
        "score": 5
