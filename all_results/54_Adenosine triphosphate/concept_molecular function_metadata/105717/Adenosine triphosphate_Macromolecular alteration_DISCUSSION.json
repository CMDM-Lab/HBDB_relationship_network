    "context": "[1] Since, in general, \u00ce\u201dCp correlates well with the amount of surface area buried at the complex interface , we have tried to calculate \u00ce\u201dCp from the surface area of HSV1 TK buried by dT and ATP, respectively, and by both substrates together. [2] The calculation (Equation 2) is based on a large body of structural and thermodynamic data for protein folding, protein-protein association, and protein-ligand binding. [1] Since the three-dimensional structure of substrate-free HSV1 TK is not known, we could not relate the calculated surface changes with actual structural data. [2] However, from the crystal structure of the TK\u00c2\u00b7dT\u00c2\u00b7ATP complex, one can calculate the buried area for the case of a rigid body binding model in which the dT and ATP binding sites preexist and no conformational changes take place. [3] Obviously, this assumption was unjustified in view of the ordered sequential binding mechanism. [4] Indeed, the heat capacity changes calculated from \u00ce\u201dASA for the rigid body binding model were accordingly much smaller than the experimentally determined ones (Table II).  [1] One has to remember that surface burial calculated according to Equation 2 takes into account mainly hydration effects, which are not the only contributions to \u00ce\u201dCp. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding with HSV1 TK and dT, where the changes in heat capacity (\u0394Cp) are calculated based on the surface area buried during the complex formation. While ATP is a substrate involved in the binding process, the term 'macromolecular alteration' refers to the structural changes in proteins upon binding. The relationship suggests that ATP's interaction with macromolecules like proteins can lead to alterations in their structural and thermodynamic properties, although specific details on the nature of these alterations are not provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ATP's role in binding and its impact on macromolecular structure is discussed, indicating a connection between ATP and macromolecular alteration, but without detailed exploration of the specific alterations.",
