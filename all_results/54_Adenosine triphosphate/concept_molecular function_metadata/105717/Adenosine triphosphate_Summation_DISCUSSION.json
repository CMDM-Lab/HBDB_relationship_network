    "context": " [5] One might argue that ATP binding was entropy-driven and that \u00ce\u201dH for ATP binding was so small that it escaped detection by ITC.  [6] This possibility could be ruled out because the entire set of thermodynamic parameters satisfied the cycle shown in Fig.6.  [7] Fig. 6 summarizes the energetics of binding of dT and ATP at 25\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C and pH 7.5.  [8] Summation of the parameters for reactions i and ii equaled almost exactly the parameters determined independently for the single reaction of the apoenzyme with dT and ATP together.  [9] The free energy change for dT binding was smaller than for ATP binding, \u00e2\u02c6\u20197.2 versus \u00e2\u02c6\u20199.0 kcal mol\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, but the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity changes were significantly larger for the initial dT binding. [10] Comparing absolute values, one notes that \u00ce\u201dH was 1.4 times larger, and T\u00ce\u201dS and \u00ce\u201dCp were 2.5 times larger for dT binding than for the subsequent ATP binding. [11] This means that dT binding, which induced the formation of a tight ATP binding site, was driven by a large enthalpy change but at a high cost in entropy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding energetics, where the summation of thermodynamic parameters for ATP and dT binding is analyzed. The text indicates that the summation of parameters for two reactions aligns closely with the parameters for a single reaction involving both dT and ATP, suggesting a significant relationship in their binding energetics. This implies that the concept of summation is crucial for understanding the thermodynamics of ATP binding.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and summation, as the context discusses how the summation of thermodynamic parameters is essential for understanding ATP binding energetics, supported by quantitative comparisons.",
