    "context": " [8] Therefore, the nonspecific background was usually estimated by averaging the small heats at the end of the titration.  [9] Raw data were collected, corrected for ligand heats of dilution, and integrated using the Microcal Origin software supplied with the instrument. [10] Since protein concentration was expressed on a subunit basis, a single-site binding model was fit to the data by a nonlinear regression analysis to yield binding constants (K B), enthalpies of binding (\u00ce\u201dH), and stoichiometry of binding. [1] High performance liquid chromatography was used for concentration determination of thymidine and ATP in the final ligand solutions and to monitor potential phosphorylation products during calorimetric experiments using a modified protocol of a previously published method . [2] Nucleotides were determined by reverse-phase ion-paired chromatography using a C18 column (LiChrospher 100 RP-18, 5 \u00ce\u00bcm, 250 \u00c3\u2014 4 mm; Merck) in 0.2m NaH2PO4, 25 mmtetrabutylammonium, 3% (v/v) methanol at 1.0 ml/min and detection at 254 nm. [3] Ligand concentrations were calculated by means of calibration curves from standard solutions showing linearity in the range of <0.04 to at least 2 mm. [4] The detection limit for dT, dTMP, and ATP was <20 nmol . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is mentioned in relation to its quantification during calorimetric experiments and chromatography methods. However, there is no mention or discussion of 'adjudication' in a biological or chemical context, making it unclear how these two terms relate to each other. The terms appear in the same document but do not interact or connect meaningfully.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between ATP and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect connection or relevance to each other.",
