    "context": "[3] It was also found that the replacement of the conserved Asp566 residue with Leu in motif B severely impaired its ATP-binding and ATPase activities. [4] Similarly, this type of mutation was lethal in poliovirus 2C, as no viral RNA replication could be detected in cells transfected with mutant transcripts, suggesting a functional role for the NTP-binding motif of 2C in the RNA replication and proliferation of poliovirus . [5] The lack of ATP binding obtained with the RHDV \u00ce\u201d2C site B mutant (D566L) does not agree with the results of an earlier mutational study involving the B motif (DEAD) of the mammalian translation initiation factor eIF-4A, which is included in the superfamily II helicases . [6] In this case, ATP binding was not affected by mutations in the B motif, although ATP hydrolysis was abolished . [7] This discrepancy may reflect differences in the ATP-binding capacities of the members of superfamilies II and III of RNA helicases. [8] In addition, mutations in other conserved amino acid residues, such as Lys135 (domain A) and Asp177 (motif B), also abolished the ATPase activity of the poliovirus 2C protein . [1] Conservative-replacement studies, with amino acid residues from RHDV \u00ce\u201d2C motifs A and B replaced by residues observed at the equivalent picornavirus 2C protein positions, showed that this type of changes more severely affected ATP hydrolysis than ATP-binding capacity, suggesting the biological relevance of these residues, particularly that of Thr529.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is critically linked to mutations in the poliovirus 2C protein, where specific mutations impair ATP-binding and ATPase activities, leading to lethal consequences for viral RNA replication. The study highlights how mutations in conserved residues affect ATP's functional role in RNA helicase activity, emphasizing the importance of ATP in the biological processes influenced by these mutations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and mutations, as the context provides evidence of how specific mutations directly impact ATP-binding and hydrolysis, which are crucial for viral replication. This relationship is well-supported by experimental findings.",
