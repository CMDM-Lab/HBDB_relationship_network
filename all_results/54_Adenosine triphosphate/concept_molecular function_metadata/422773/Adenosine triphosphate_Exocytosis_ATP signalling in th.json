    "context": "Secretomotor neurons in the submucosal plexus, which receive inhibitory noradrenergic synaptic input from sympathetic postganglionic neurons, are found to express P2Y1 receptors. The action of ATP is opposite to NA: activation of the P2Y1 receptors on secretomotor neurons by stimulus-evoked sympathetic release of ATP is excitatory. These secretomotor neurons also receive excitatory purinergic input from the myenteric plexus and other neurons elsewhere in the submucosal plexus, suggesting the ATP might be involved in the minute-to-minute control of mucosal secretion at the ENS microcircuit level [53\u201355]. In the small intestine and colon, ATP was found to stimulate water, Cl\u2212 and HCO3 \u2212 secretion \u2013 the effects also mediated by P2Y1 receptors. ATP signalling in the central nervous control of autonomic function ATP-mediated purinergic signalling has been implicated in the central control of autonomic function in the hypothalamus and the brain stem. At the hypothalamic level ATP is involved in the regulation of neurohormone (vasopressin and oxytocin) release (for review, see Ref.) and in the mechanisms of body temperature control. The functional role of ATP in the brainstem has been under particular scrutiny in recent years. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule that activates P2Y1 receptors on secretomotor neurons, leading to excitatory responses. This activation suggests that ATP plays a significant role in stimulating exocytosis of neurohormones and secretion of electrolytes in the gastrointestinal tract, indicating its importance in the regulation of mucosal secretion and autonomic functions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ATP and exocytosis, as ATP's role in stimulating secretion through P2Y1 receptor activation is well-supported by the context. The evidence of ATP's involvement in neurohormone release further emphasizes its critical function in exocytosis.",
