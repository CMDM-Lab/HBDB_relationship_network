    "context": "Now it is firmly established that ATP is used either as a sole transmitter or cotransmitter by many neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Receptors for purines and pyrimidines were cloned and characterized in the 1990s; four subtypes of G-protein-coupled P1 (adenosine) receptors, seven subtypes of ionotropic P2X receptor subunits (which form homomeric or heteromeric channels) and eight subtypes of G-protein-coupled metabotropic P2Y receptors for ATP have been identified. Apart from a release of ATP by damaged or dying cells, physiological release of ATP from both neuronal and non-neuronal cells can be triggered by various stimuli. Several mechanisms of ATP release have been described that include the involvement of vesicular exocytosis, connexin and/or pannexin hemichannels, maxi anion and P2X7 channels. In the extracellular space ATP is rapidly broken down by ectonucleotidases to ADP, AMP and adenosine. Ectonucleotidase activity is important in shaping purinergic signalling by removing ATP and also by producing ATP metabolites, which are also active ligands for various purinergic receptors. Functionally, adenosine might be the most important product of ATP degradation by ectonucleotidases. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a key molecule involved in neurotransmission, where it can act as a transmitter or cotransmitter in the nervous system. The release of ATP is facilitated through mechanisms such as vesicular exocytosis, indicating a direct relationship between ATP and the process of exocytosis, which is crucial for the secretion of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. This underscores the importance of ATP in cellular communication and signaling pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and exocytosis, as ATP is released via exocytosis and plays a critical role in neurotransmission. The context provides evidence of ATP's involvement in exocytosis mechanisms, supporting its relevance in physiological processes.",
