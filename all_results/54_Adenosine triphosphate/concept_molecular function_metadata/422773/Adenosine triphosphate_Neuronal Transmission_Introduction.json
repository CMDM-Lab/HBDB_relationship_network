    "context": "Functionally, adenosine might be the most important product of ATP degradation by ectonucleotidases. In this review, however, we concentrate mostly on the functional role of ATP acting at P2 receptors. The effects of adenosine are not discussed in detail and can be found in recent reviews (for example, see Ref.). Abbracchio et al.  provided a general overview of purinergic signalling in the nervous system, discussing recent data on the release and extracellular fate of ATP and other nucleotides, structure and properties of purinergic receptors, ATP contribution to synaptic currents and neuronal\u2013glial transmission in the CNS, and the role of ATP in development, regeneration and pathology of the nervous system. Here, we endeavour to summarize a substantial amount of data demonstrating an important role for ATP-mediated purinergic signalling in various aspects of autonomic control. The autonomic nervous system The autonomic nervous system can be viewed as the CNS neuronal circuits that receive sensory visceral information and generate control of the efferent output to various cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, respiratory, endocrine, reproductive and gastrointestinal targets. From the efferent point of view the autonomic nervous system has been historically divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic arms. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule in purinergic signaling within the nervous system, particularly in relation to neuronal transmission. ATP acts at P2 receptors, contributing to synaptic currents and facilitating communication between neurons and glial cells. The review emphasizes ATP's role in various aspects of neuronal function, including development and pathology, indicating its significant involvement in neuronal transmission processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ATP and neuronal transmission, as ATP's role in purinergic signaling and synaptic activity is well-supported by the context. However, the discussion does not delve deeply into specific mechanisms or quantitative data, preventing a perfect score.",
        "score": 4
