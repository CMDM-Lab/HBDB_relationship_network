    "context": "The expression profile of P2 receptors and the effects of ATP in parasympathetic ganglia usually are very similar to those observed in sympathetic neurons. There are differences in the expression of various P2X and P2Y receptors and the effects evoked by ATP and its analogues on parasympathetic ganglion cells in different species. The functional role of ATP-mediated signalling in parasympathetic ganglia is less clear, probably owing to the fact that these ganglia are smaller, have a more diffuse location, and, therefore, are much harder to study. ATP signalling and sensory transduction There is a vast literature on the distribution of the receptors and the effects of ATP on sensory neurons. The function and expression profile for native P2X receptors are characterized for sensory neurons from dorsal root, trigeminal, nodose and petrosal ganglia. All P2X receptor subtypes (except P2X7) and some P2Y receptors are expressed by sensory neurons, although the P2X3 and P2X2 receptor subunits have the highest level of expression. These subunits form homomeric P2X3 and P2X2 and heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors; when present on sensory fibres and terminals, these receptors sense changes in local concentrations of ATP released in response to an appropriate physiological stimulus or in pathological conditions.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction, particularly in the functioning of P2 receptors in parasympathetic and sensory neurons. ATP acts as a signaling molecule that activates various P2X and P2Y receptors, which are involved in sensory transduction by responding to changes in local ATP concentrations during physiological and pathological stimuli. The expression and functional roles of these receptors highlight the importance of ATP in mediating cellular communication and responses in the nervous system.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between ATP and signal transduction, as ATP is directly implicated in the activation of P2 receptors that mediate signaling pathways in neurons, demonstrating a critical relationship in physiological processes.",
        "score": 5
