    "context": "Several years later ATP was proposed to act as a cotransmitter with \u2018classical\u2019 transmitters in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves (for review, see Ref.). Now it is firmly established that ATP is used either as a sole transmitter or cotransmitter by many neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS). Receptors for purines and pyrimidines were cloned and characterized in the 1990s; four subtypes of G-protein-coupled P1 (adenosine) receptors, seven subtypes of ionotropic P2X receptor subunits (which form homomeric or heteromeric channels) and eight subtypes of G-protein-coupled metabotropic P2Y receptors for ATP have been identified. Apart from a release of ATP by damaged or dying cells, physiological release of ATP from both neuronal and non-neuronal cells can be triggered by various stimuli. Several mechanisms of ATP release have been described that include the involvement of vesicular exocytosis, connexin and/or pannexin hemichannels, maxi anion and P2X7 channels. In the extracellular space ATP is rapidly broken down by ectonucleotidases to ADP, AMP and adenosine. Ectonucleotidase activity is important in shaping purinergic signalling by removing ATP and also by producing ATP metabolites, which are also active ligands for various purinergic receptors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is described as a key signaling molecule that can be released from cells in response to various stimuli. It acts as a cotransmitter in the nervous system, influencing neuronal communication. The release of ATP can be triggered by physiological stimuli, highlighting its role in purinergic signaling and cellular responses to environmental changes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and stimuli, as ATP's release is directly linked to various physiological stimuli, indicating its critical role in cellular signaling and communication.",
