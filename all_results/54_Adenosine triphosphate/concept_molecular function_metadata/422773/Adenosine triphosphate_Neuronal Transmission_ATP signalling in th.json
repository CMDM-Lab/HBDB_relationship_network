    "context": "Simultaneous blockade of P2 and excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors in the NTS significantly attenuates increases in arterial blood pressure and thoracic sympathetic activity in response to chemoreceptor stimulation, suggesting that ATP signalling is involved in mediating the sympathoexcitatory component of the arterial chemoreflex (Figure 4 ). Rhythmic release of ATP and glutamate phase-locked to lung inflation and independent of the central respiratory drive was recorded in the NTS, suggesting that both transmitters are released from the central terminals of the lung stretch-receptor afferents. P2 and EAA receptor antagonists significantly reduce baseline lung-inflation-induced firing of the NTS second-order relay neurons, which receive monosynaptic inputs from these receptors. These data demonstrate that at the NTS level ATP contributes to neurotransmission of the pulmonary stretch receptor (Breuer-Hering) reflex pathway \u2013 a key respiratory mechano-reflex influencing the duration of inspiration. Cardiovascular and respiratory afferent information is processed and integrated by the NTS neuronal circuits and then transmitted to the respiratory, vagal preganglionic and presympathetic neuronal networks, which generate appropriate commands to the respiratory muscles, heart and different vascular beds. It seems that ATP influences the activity of all these brainstem networks. The neuronal circuits responsible for the generation and shaping of the respiratory pattern and transmitting this pattern to motoneurons controlling respiratory muscles are located in the pons and the medulla oblongata.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is implicated in neuronal transmission within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), where it plays a role in mediating the sympathoexcitatory response to chemoreceptor stimulation. ATP is released rhythmically alongside glutamate, influencing the firing of NTS neurons that relay information from pulmonary stretch receptors. This suggests that ATP is crucial for neurotransmission in the reflex pathways that regulate respiratory and cardiovascular functions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP is directly involved in neuronal transmission processes within the NTS, demonstrating a critical role in the integration of respiratory and cardiovascular signals.",
        "score": 5
