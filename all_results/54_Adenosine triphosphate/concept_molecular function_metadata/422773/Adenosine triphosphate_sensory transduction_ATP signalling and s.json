    "context": "The expression profile of P2 receptors and the effects of ATP in parasympathetic ganglia usually are very similar to those observed in sympathetic neurons. There are differences in the expression of various P2X and P2Y receptors and the effects evoked by ATP and its analogues on parasympathetic ganglion cells in different species. The functional role of ATP-mediated signalling in parasympathetic ganglia is less clear, probably owing to the fact that these ganglia are smaller, have a more diffuse location, and, therefore, are much harder to study. ATP signalling and sensory transduction There is a vast literature on the distribution of the receptors and the effects of ATP on sensory neurons. The function and expression profile for native P2X receptors are characterized for sensory neurons from dorsal root, trigeminal, nodose and petrosal ganglia. All P2X receptor subtypes (except P2X7) and some P2Y receptors are expressed by sensory neurons, although the P2X3 and P2X2 receptor subunits have the highest level of expression. These subunits form homomeric P2X3 and P2X2 and heteromeric P2X2/3 receptors; when present on sensory fibres and terminals, these receptors sense changes in local concentrations of ATP released in response to an appropriate physiological stimulus or in pathological conditions.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in sensory transduction by acting on P2X and P2Y receptors expressed in sensory neurons. The release of ATP in response to physiological stimuli activates these receptors, facilitating the transmission of sensory signals. The study highlights the importance of ATP-mediated signaling in sensory neurons, particularly in the context of understanding how sensory information is processed and relayed in the nervous system.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP is directly involved in sensory transduction through its interaction with specific receptors in sensory neurons, indicating a critical relationship supported by detailed discussion in the context.",
        "score": 5
