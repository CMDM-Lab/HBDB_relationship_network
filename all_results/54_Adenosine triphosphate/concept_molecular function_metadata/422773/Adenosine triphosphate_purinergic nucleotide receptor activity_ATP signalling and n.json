    "context": "Studies of the release and metabolism of endogenous ATP in rat superior cervical ganglia suggests that ATP and ACh are released simultaneously in response to stimulation of preganglionic nerve terminals. A likely functional role for ATP in sympathetic ganglia was demonstrated in coeliac ganglion neurons where excitatory synaptic potentials and currents are mimicked by ATP and blocked by suramin and \u03b1,\u03b2-methyleneATP desensitisation. The expression profile of P2 receptors and the effects of ATP in parasympathetic ganglia usually are very similar to those observed in sympathetic neurons. There are differences in the expression of various P2X and P2Y receptors and the effects evoked by ATP and its analogues on parasympathetic ganglion cells in different species. The functional role of ATP-mediated signalling in parasympathetic ganglia is less clear, probably owing to the fact that these ganglia are smaller, have a more diffuse location, and, therefore, are much harder to study. ATP signalling and sensory transduction There is a vast literature on the distribution of the receptors and the effects of ATP on sensory neurons. The function and expression profile for native P2X receptors are characterized for sensory neurons from dorsal root, trigeminal, nodose and petrosal ganglia. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a key signaling molecule that interacts with purinergic nucleotide receptors, specifically P2 receptors, in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. The simultaneous release of ATP and acetylcholine (ACh) suggests a functional role for ATP in neurotransmission. The study indicates that ATP can mimic excitatory synaptic potentials, demonstrating its significant role in receptor activity and signaling pathways within the nervous system.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ATP and purinergic nucleotide receptor activity, as ATP's role in neurotransmission and receptor activation is well-supported by the context, indicating a clear functional relationship.",
        "score": 4
