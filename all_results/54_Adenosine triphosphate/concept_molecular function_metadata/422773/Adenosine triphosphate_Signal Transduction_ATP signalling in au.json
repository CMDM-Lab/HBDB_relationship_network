    "context": "Both systems consist of central neuronal circuits controlling cholinergic preganglionic CNS neurons, which, in turn, innervate autonomic ganglia, glands and peripheral semi-autonomous neural networks such as the enteric nervous system (ENS). The latter is now considered by some to be a third division of the autonomic nervous system. ATP-mediated purinergic signalling seems to have an important role in the operation of the autonomic nervous system at multiple steps of the reflex pathways, from the transduction of sensory information to neuroeffector transmission. ATP signalling in autonomic neuroeffector transmission There is considerable evidence that ATP has an important role as a signalling molecule of NANC nerves found in the respiratory, cardiovascular and urogenital systems, and in the gastrointestinal tract. In the late 1960s many substances were examined as putative transmitters in the NANC nerves of the gastrointestinal tract and bladder, but the substance that best satisfied criteria for function as a neurotransmitter was ATP. Nerves utilizing ATP as their principal transmitter were subsequently named \u2018purinergic\u2019. ATP is released together with noradrenaline (NA) from sympathetic nerves supplying various peripheral targets (Figure 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule involved in purinergic signaling within the autonomic nervous system. It plays a significant role in signal transduction processes, facilitating communication between neurons and their targets, particularly in neuroeffector transmission across various systems, including respiratory and gastrointestinal. The evidence suggests that ATP functions as a neurotransmitter, underscoring its importance in the signaling pathways that govern autonomic functions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and signal transduction, as ATP is explicitly described as a key signaling molecule in the context of neuroeffector transmission and autonomic nervous system function.",
        "score": 5
