    "context": "[6] Fluorescence live-cell imaging was performed with an inverted Leica DMI6000B microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a temperature controlled stage incubator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and a Spot Boost EMCCD BT 2100 camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). [7] Fluorescence images were taken through 100\u00c3\u2014 (NA 1.3) or 63\u00c3\u2014 (NA 1.4) oil objectives (Leica) using an YFP-2427A filter set (Semrock, Rochester, NY) and \u00ce\u00bcManager software that was developed in Ron Vale's laboratory at UCSF and with funding from the National Institutes of Health, NIH Grant R01-EB007187. [8] The ATP cell surface concentration was estimated by comparison of fluorescence signals obtained with ATP standards (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c100 \u00ce\u00bcm). [1] ATP release during synapse formation was also assessed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). [2] Jurkat cells were stained with 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) as described above and stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated polystyrene beads, which display negligible autofluorescence. [3] Cell/bead aggregates were identified by their characteristic forward and side scattering properties and the percentage of 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II)+ cells releasing high amounts of ATP was determined where cells were considered 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II)+ whose mean fluorescence intensity was higher than that of 95% of unstimulated control cells. [1] For imaging of intracellular ATP firing, cells were loaded with 100 \u00ce\u00bcm of the lipid anchor-free ATP probe, 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II), in the presence of 1% DMSO. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is assessed for its role during synapse formation, indicating its involvement in synaptogenesis. The study measures ATP release during the formation of cell aggregates, suggesting that ATP may play a critical role in the signaling processes that facilitate synaptic connections. The methods employed, including fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry, highlight the importance of ATP in cellular interactions relevant to synaptogenesis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and synaptogenesis, as the context discusses ATP's release during synapse formation and its potential role in facilitating synaptic connections, supported by experimental methods.",
        "score": 4
