    "context": "[4] We found that stimulation of T cells triggers a spike in cellular ATP production that doubles intracellular ATP levels in <30 s and causes prolonged ATP release into the extracellular space. [5] Cell stimulation triggered rapid mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, increased oxidative phosphorylation, a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m), and the accumulation of active mitochondria at the immune synapse of stimulated T cells. [6] Inhibition of mitochondria with CCCP, KCN, or rotenone blocked intracellular ATP production, ATP release, intracellular Ca2+ signaling, induction of the early activation marker CD69, and IL-2 transcription in response to cell stimulation. [7] These findings demonstrate that rapid activation of mitochondrial ATP production fuels the purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate T cells and define their role in host defense. [1] Critically ill patients often develop profound immunosuppression and nosocomial infections due to impaired T cell function . [2] However, the underlying mechanisms leading to T cell dysfunction have remained unclear . [1] The release of cellular ATP via pannexin-1 channels (panx1)2 and autocrine feedback through purinergic receptors are being recognized as essential steps required for proper T cell activation . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction during T cell activation. The stimulation of T cells leads to a rapid increase in ATP production, which is essential for purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate T cell functions. This ATP release and subsequent signaling are vital for intracellular calcium signaling and the activation of immune responses, highlighting the direct relationship between ATP and signal transduction in immune cell function.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP is directly involved in the signal transduction processes that regulate T cell activation and function, with clear evidence of its role in purinergic signaling mechanisms.",
