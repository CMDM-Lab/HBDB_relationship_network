    "context": "[4] Suramin had no effect in these experiments, indicating that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake occurs independently of P2 receptors (Fig. 7E). [5] To assess concomitant intracellular ATP production, we used an intracellular ATP probe, 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) that was also developed in the laboratory of Prof. Hamachi and is structurally identical to 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II), except that 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) lacks the membrane anchor residue and can be taken up by cells . [6] Using this probe, we found that mitochondrial firing in response to cell stimulation resulted in rapid bursts of intracellular ATP release, apparently by the release of ATP from activated mitochondria (supplemental Movie S8). [7] Taken together, these findings demonstrate that T cell stimulation triggers rapid mitochondrial ATP production accompanied by bursts in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as by a sudden drop in \u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m. [1] Rapid mitochondrial activation and Ca2+ influx precede sustained cytosolic Ca2+ signaling. [2] A and B, primary human CD4+ T cells (A) and Jurkat cells (B) were loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ probe Rhod-2, stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads, and mitochondrial Ca2+ firing was assessed with live-cell imaging (100\u00c3\u2014 oil objective, NA 1.3; see also s u p p l em e n t a l M o v i e s S 5 a n d S 6). [3] C and D, Jurkat cells expressing the mitochondrial Ca2+ biosensor mito-CAR-GECO1 were treated or not (control) with latrunculin B (10 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) or CCCP (10 \u00ce\u00bcm) for 10 min and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to mitochondrial uptake processes during T cell stimulation. The study highlights that stimulation leads to rapid bursts of intracellular ATP release from activated mitochondria, indicating a direct relationship between ATP production and its uptake by cells. This suggests that ATP plays a crucial role in cellular energy dynamics and signaling during immune responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and its uptake, as the context discusses how T cell stimulation triggers ATP production and its subsequent release, indicating a clear relationship in cellular metabolism and signaling.",
