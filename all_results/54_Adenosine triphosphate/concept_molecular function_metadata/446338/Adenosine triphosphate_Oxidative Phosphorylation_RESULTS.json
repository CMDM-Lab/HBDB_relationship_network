    "context": "[4] Suramin had no effect in these experiments, indicating that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake occurs independently of P2 receptors (Fig. 7E). [5] To assess concomitant intracellular ATP production, we used an intracellular ATP probe, 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) that was also developed in the laboratory of Prof. Hamachi and is structurally identical to 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II), except that 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2Zn(II) lacks the membrane anchor residue and can be taken up by cells . [6] Using this probe, we found that mitochondrial firing in response to cell stimulation resulted in rapid bursts of intracellular ATP release, apparently by the release of ATP from activated mitochondria (supplemental Movie S8). [7] Taken together, these findings demonstrate that T cell stimulation triggers rapid mitochondrial ATP production accompanied by bursts in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as by a sudden drop in \u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m. [1] Rapid mitochondrial activation and Ca2+ influx precede sustained cytosolic Ca2+ signaling. [2] A and B, primary human CD4+ T cells (A) and Jurkat cells (B) were loaded with the mitochondrial Ca2+ probe Rhod-2, stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads, and mitochondrial Ca2+ firing was assessed with live-cell imaging (100\u00c3\u2014 oil objective, NA 1.3; see also s u p p l em e n t a l M o v i e s S 5 a n d S 6). [3] C and D, Jurkat cells expressing the mitochondrial Ca2+ biosensor mito-CAR-GECO1 were treated or not (control) with latrunculin B (10 \u00ce\u00bcg/ml) or CCCP (10 \u00ce\u00bcm) for 10 min and stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads.

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced rapidly in response to T cell stimulation, which is closely linked to oxidative phosphorylation. The findings indicate that mitochondrial activation leads to bursts of ATP release, highlighting the critical role of oxidative phosphorylation in generating ATP during cellular activation. This relationship underscores the importance of mitochondrial function in energy production within immune cells.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and oxidative phosphorylation, as ATP production is a key outcome of oxidative phosphorylation processes in mitochondria during T cell activation, supported by experimental evidence in the context.",
        "score": 5
