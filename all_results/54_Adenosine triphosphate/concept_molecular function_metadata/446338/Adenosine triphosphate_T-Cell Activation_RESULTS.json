    "context": "[4] In addition, we found that mitochondrial ROS production in T cells of sepsis patients was significantly lower compared with cells from healthy controls (Fig. 8D). [5] Although the mechanisms involved in the ATP release are still not completely understood, it seems likely that opening of panx1 channels is essential. [6] In support of this assumption, we found that IL-2 expression was significantly suppressed in T cells of panx1 knock-out mice (Fig. 8E). [7] The absence of panx1 channels and blockage of mitochondrial ATP production had similar effects on T cell activation. [8] Taken together, these findings show that mitochondrial ATP production, ATP release via panx1, and purinergic signaling are critical requirements for proper T cell function and a successful host defense.  [1] Proper T cell effector functions require mitochondrial ATP production.  [2] A, Jurkat cells were treated (red line) or not (black and blue line) with CCCP (1 \u00ce\u00bcm) for 10 min and stimulated or not (black line) for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial component for T-cell activation and function. The study indicates that mitochondrial ATP production and its release through panx1 channels are essential for proper T-cell activation and effector functions. The absence of these mechanisms leads to impaired T-cell responses, emphasizing the critical role of ATP in immune defense.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and strong relevance between ATP and T-cell activation, as the context clearly establishes ATP's essential role in T-cell function and the mechanisms involved in its release and signaling.",
