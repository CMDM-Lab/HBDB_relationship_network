    "context": "[10] CCCP, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, was used as a control and caused a further drop and complete dissipation of \u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m. [11] The decrease in \u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m following T cell stimulation suggests intense mitochondrial activity and ATP production due to heavy ion flux and ATP release across the mitochondrial membrane. [12] As with stimulated T cells, firing neurons are also known to show a drop in \u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m during bursts of heavy mitochondrial activity, which involves vigorous mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and ATP release . [13] Taken together with these findings, our results suggest that mitochondrial depolarization and massive mitochondrial ATP production are characteristics not only of synaptic activity in neurons but also in T cells that generate ATP for release into the IS. [1] TCR stimulation decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential \u00ce\u201d\u00cf\u02c6m in T cells. [2] CD4+ T cells (A and B) or Jurkat cells (C) were stained with JC-1, stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28-coated beads for the indicated periods of time, and red and green JC-1 fluorescence was recorded with a flow cytometer. [3] Representative histograms after 20 min stimulation are shown in A. CCCP (10 \u00ce\u00bcm) was added as a control for maximal depolarization. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production is closely linked to depolarization events in both T cells and neurons. The stimulation of T cells leads to mitochondrial depolarization, which is associated with increased ATP production due to heightened mitochondrial activity. This relationship highlights the role of ATP in supporting cellular functions during depolarization, particularly in response to stimulation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP production is directly tied to the process of depolarization in the context of T cell and neuronal activity, indicating a critical relationship supported by the findings presented.",
