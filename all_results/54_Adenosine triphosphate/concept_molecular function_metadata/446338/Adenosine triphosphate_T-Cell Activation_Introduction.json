    "context": "[6] However, recent evidence suggests that mitochondria may have a more profound role in T cell activation. [7] For example, mitochondria have been shown to accumulate at the immune synapse (IS) that T cells form with antigen-presenting cells (APC). [8] Mitochondria are thought to be necessary in order to regulate Ca2+ homeostasis and to generate reactive oxygen species that modulate signaling pathways downstream of the TCR/CD28 co-receptor . [1] Here we show that mitochondria play another critical role in T cell activation, namely the production of intracellular ATP that is released from stimulated cells in order to fuel the purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate T cell activation at the IS. [2] Our findings indicate that mitochondria are gate-keepers of T cell activation that coordinate Ca2+ homeostasis with autocrine purinergic signaling processes to orchestrate the complex choreography of T cell activation events required for a successful immune response. [1] Dynabeads (Invitrogen Dynal AS, Oslo, Norway) or polystyrene particles (3.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c3.9 \u00ce\u00bcm, Spherotech, Lake Forest, IL) coated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were labeled with mouse anti-human CD3 and anti-human CD28 antibodies (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and used for T cell stimulation. [2] Mouse anti-human CD69-FITC antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial component in T cell activation. Mitochondria are shown to produce ATP, which is released from stimulated T cells to fuel purinergic signaling mechanisms at the immune synapse. This ATP production is essential for regulating calcium homeostasis and modulating signaling pathways that are critical for effective T cell activation and immune response.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and T cell activation, as ATP production is necessary for the signaling processes that facilitate T cell activation, supported by strong contextual evidence.",
