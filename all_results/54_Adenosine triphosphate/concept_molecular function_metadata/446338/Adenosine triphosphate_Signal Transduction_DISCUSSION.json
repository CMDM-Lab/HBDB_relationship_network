    "context": "[1] Based on our findings, we propose a yinyang-like mechanism whereby mitochondria integrate purinergic and Ca2+ signaling at the IS (Fig. 9). [2] TCR stimulation initially triggers an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ levels that is followed by rapid ATP production and the release of ATP into the extracellular space via panx1 channels and probably additional release mechanisms . [3] ATP in the IS then stimulates P2X receptors that function as ATP-gated Ca2+ channels and facilitate Ca2+ influx. [4] These inside-out/outside-in feedback loops escalate mitochondrial ATP production, thereby amplifying TCR/CD28 signaling and sustaining Ca2+ influx through P2X receptors. [1] Proposed model of the regulation of Ca2+ and purinergic signaling by mitochondrial firing. [2] TCR/CD28 stimulation triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, resulting in mitochondrial Ca2+ firing and ATP production that feeds autocrine purinergic signaling and prolonged Ca2+ influx via P2X1 and P2X4 receptors at the immune synapse. [1] Impairments of these interconnected signaling processes can inhibit T cell function and cause immunosuppression . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction, particularly in T cell activation. The release of ATP into the extracellular space stimulates P2X receptors, which are ATP-gated Ca2+ channels, facilitating calcium influx. This process amplifies TCR/CD28 signaling and sustains calcium influx, highlighting ATP's integral function in modulating cellular signaling pathways and immune responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and signal transduction, as ATP is essential for activating P2X receptors that mediate calcium signaling, thereby influencing T cell function and immune responses.",
        "score": 5
