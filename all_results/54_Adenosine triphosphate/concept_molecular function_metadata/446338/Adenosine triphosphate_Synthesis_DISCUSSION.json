    "context": "[10] However, our data also show that the rapid increase in cellular ATP production during T cell activation requires additional mechanisms that provide the ADP that mitochondria phosphorylate to ATP. [11] It is likely that purine salvage pathways are involved in these mechanisms . [12] Several immune dysfunctions, including SCID, are caused by deficiencies of key enzymes involved in purine salvage pathways . [13] However, it is also possible that de novo purine synthesis and creatine kinases are involved in the formation of ADP that can be phosphorylated and converted to ATP in mitochondria . [14] Further studies are needed to delineate these mechanisms. [1] Our novel finding that mitochondria provide ATP for autocrine purinergic signaling at the IS is supported by previous reports that suggest a direct involvement of mitochondria in T cell activation. [2] For example, mitochondria were shown to accumulate at the IS and to regulate store-operated Ca2+ signaling by buffering inflowing Ca2+ ions, thus preventing termination of Ca2+ signaling . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to the synthesis processes involved in T cell activation. The rapid increase in ATP production during this activation requires mechanisms that provide adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for phosphorylation to ATP in mitochondria. The discussion includes the potential roles of purine salvage pathways and de novo purine synthesis in ATP synthesis, highlighting the importance of these pathways in immune function and cellular energy metabolism.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ATP and synthesis, as the context discusses the mechanisms of ATP production and the involvement of various pathways in its synthesis during T cell activation, supported by evidence of mitochondrial involvement.",
