    "context": "[5] Although the mechanisms involved in the ATP release are still not completely understood, it seems likely that opening of panx1 channels is essential. [6] In support of this assumption, we found that IL-2 expression was significantly suppressed in T cells of panx1 knock-out mice (Fig. 8E). [7] The absence of panx1 channels and blockage of mitochondrial ATP production had similar effects on T cell activation. [8] Taken together, these findings show that mitochondrial ATP production, ATP release via panx1, and purinergic signaling are critical requirements for proper T cell function and a successful host defense.  [1] Proper T cell effector functions require mitochondrial ATP production.  [2] A, Jurkat cells were treated (red line) or not (black and blue line) with CCCP (1 \u00ce\u00bcm) for 10 min and stimulated or not (black line) for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28 beads.  [3] The expression of the early T cell activation marker CD69 was analyzed by flow cytometry. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule for signal transduction in T cells, particularly through its release via panx1 channels and its role in purinergic signaling. The study indicates that mitochondrial ATP production and ATP release are essential for T cell activation and function, linking ATP directly to the mechanisms of signal transduction in immune responses.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP is directly involved in the signal transduction processes necessary for T cell activation and function, with clear evidence provided in the context regarding its critical role in immune signaling.",
