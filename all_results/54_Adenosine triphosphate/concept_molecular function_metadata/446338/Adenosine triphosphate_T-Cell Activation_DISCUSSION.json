    "context": "[3] The authors also showed that ROS production depends on Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake . [4] Taken together with these findings, our results indicate that mitochondrial ROS as well as ATP production have important roles in T cell activation. [5] We found a spike in ATP production that may fuel autocrine purinergic signaling processes that contribute to Ca2+ influx as well as intracellular processes associated with T cell proliferation. [6] Taken together with previous reports, we conclude that mitochondria have at least three different tasks in T cell activation: generating a rapid burst in ATP production that triggers autocrine purinergic signaling, production of ROS that regulate downstream signaling pathways, and regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis that sustains T cell responses. [1] T cells are able to respond with remarkable sensitivity and selectivity to the faint antigen-induced signals generated at the IS . [2] While it has been proposed that T cells must possess sophisticated amplification mechanisms that help them respond to such weak external signals, the nature of these amplification mechanisms has remained elusive . [3] Purinergic signal amplification could explain this enigma. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T-cell activation, as it is produced in a spike that fuels autocrine purinergic signaling processes. This signaling enhances Ca2+ influx and supports intracellular processes necessary for T-cell proliferation. Mitochondria play multiple roles in T-cell activation, including ATP generation, ROS production, and Ca2+ homeostasis regulation, indicating a direct and significant relationship between ATP and T-cell activation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP is directly linked to T-cell activation through its role in signaling and proliferation processes, supported by multiple mechanisms outlined in the context.",
