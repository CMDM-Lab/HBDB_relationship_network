    "context": "[1] Our novel finding that mitochondria provide ATP for autocrine purinergic signaling at the IS is supported by previous reports that suggest a direct involvement of mitochondria in T cell activation. [2] For example, mitochondria were shown to accumulate at the IS and to regulate store-operated Ca2+ signaling by buffering inflowing Ca2+ ions, thus preventing termination of Ca2+ signaling . [3] Our current findings extend this concept by showing that mitochondria can regulate Ca2+ signaling at the IS by fueling purinergic signaling mechanisms that facilitate sustained Ca2+ influx in a P2X receptor-mediated fashion. [4] Our novel concept that mitochondria pump ATP into the IS extends previous reports that the mitochondrial fission factor DRP-1 positions mitochondria to the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC) of the IS and regulates mitochondrial ATP production near the IS . [1] Several other reports have suggested that mitochondria-derived ROS, the byproducts of mitochondrial ATP production, function as secondary messengers that are necessary for T cell activation . [2] Recently, Sena et al. reported that ROS specifically generated at complex III of the electron transport chain are required for activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and subsequent induction of IL-2 and proliferation in CD4+ T cells. [3] The authors also showed that ROS production depends on Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake . ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced by mitochondria and plays a crucial role in autocrine purinergic signaling at the immunological synapse (IS). Mitochondria not only generate ATP but also regulate calcium signaling, which is essential for T cell activation. The positioning of mitochondria at the IS, influenced by the mitochondrial fission factor DRP-1, enhances ATP production and supports sustained signaling necessary for immune responses. This highlights the integral relationship between ATP production and mitochondrial function in cellular signaling and division processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between ATP and mitochondria, as ATP production is fundamentally linked to mitochondrial function, particularly in the context of T cell activation and signaling at the IS.",
