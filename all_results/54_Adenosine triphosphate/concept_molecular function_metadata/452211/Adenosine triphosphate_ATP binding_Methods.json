    "context": "We examined how these distributions are perturbed by periodic changes of muscle length and how these distributions lead to changes in muscle mechanics and in the rate of ATP utilization. These results may help to explain why airway narrowing is limited in healthy lungs, but can become excessive in asthmatic lungs. Methods Hai and Murphy (1988a) defined the four-state myosin model to comprise free unphosphorylated myosin (M), phosphorylated myosin (Mp), phosphorylated myosin attached to actin (AMp), and unphosphorylated myosin attached to actin (AM, also called latch bridges) (Fig. 1 A ). As in their work, we assumed that both AMp and AM cross-bridges have the same stiffness, and that ATP binding is a prerequisite for detachment. The transitions among the four states are governed by seven rate constants (Fig. 1 A ). Implicit in the scheme is that cross-bridges cannot attach to actin unless they are first phosphorylated, i.e., the muscle is regulated exclusively by Ca2+-dependent state transition rate constants, k 1 and k 6 (which may vary with time), mediated by calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Hai and Murphy also assumed that the affinities of MLCK and myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) for both attached and detached cross-bridges are similar, i.e., k 1 \u2248 k 6 and k 2 \u2248 k 5 . We assessed the relationship among the time-varying external load, level of muscle activation, and actomyosin dynamics by computing numerical solutions to the HHM theory. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for muscle mechanics, specifically in the process of ATP binding, which is necessary for the detachment of cross-bridges in muscle contraction. The study discusses how ATP binding is a prerequisite for myosin to detach from actin, indicating a direct relationship between ATP and muscle function. The model presented emphasizes the importance of ATP in regulating muscle dynamics and the transitions between different states of myosin, highlighting its role in muscle activation and contraction.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP binding is explicitly described as essential for the detachment of myosin from actin, indicating a critical relationship in muscle mechanics and function. The context provides clear support for this connection.",
