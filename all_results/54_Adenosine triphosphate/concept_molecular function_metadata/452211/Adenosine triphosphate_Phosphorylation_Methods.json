    "context": "Similarly, the instantaneous state population fractions, denoted M(t), Mp(t), AMp(t), and AM(t), were computed from the zeroth spatial moment of the number state distributions. In steady state, \u3008M\u3009, \u3008Mp\u3009, \u3008AMp\u3009, and \u3008M\u3009 denote the respective average values over one period. During isometric force development instantaneous force is explicitly computed from n(x, t). The rate of ATP consumption was separately computed for each of the four transition processes indicated in Fig. 1: the detachment of Mp from AMp: {formula not available us MathML} the detachment of M from AM: {formula not available us MathML} the phosphorylation of M: {formula not available us MathML} and the phosphorylation of AM: {formula not available us MathML} The total ATP consumption rate (denoted ATPtot in the figures) is the sum of these four terms. The cyclic rate of ATP consumption (denoted ATPcycl in the figures) is designated as that component associated only with bridge detachments, i.e., the sum of the first two terms above. In particular, in steady state, the average (over one period) cross-bridge cycling rate is proportional to the average ATPcycl. Average fractional phosphorylation of myosin was calculated as \u3008Mp\u3009+\u3008AMp\u3009. ",

        "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly involved in the phosphorylation processes of myosin and actomyosin complexes during muscle contraction. The phosphorylation of these proteins is crucial for muscle function, as it regulates the interaction between actin and myosin, thereby influencing force development. The rate of ATP consumption is linked to these phosphorylation events, indicating a significant relationship between ATP and phosphorylation in muscle physiology.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ATP is essential for the phosphorylation of myosin, which is a critical process in muscle contraction. The context provides clear evidence of ATP's role in phosphorylation, highlighting its importance in muscle physiology.",
        "score": 5
