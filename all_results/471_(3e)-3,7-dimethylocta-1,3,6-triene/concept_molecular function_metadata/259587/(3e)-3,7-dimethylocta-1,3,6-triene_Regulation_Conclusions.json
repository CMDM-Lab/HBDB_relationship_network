    "context": "The production of terpenes has been demonstrated to be often regulated at the transcript level. Induction of MtEBOS was observed after wounding, and addition of insect oral factors enhanced this response. Overall, the transcript and volatile profiles suggest that expression of this gene is tightly associated with wound responses in M. truncatula. The identification of a functional \u03b2-ocimene synthase in M. truncatula, and the demonstration of herbivore-induced \u03b2-ocimene release, add to our understanding of the regulation and formation of terpenes in this important plant system. Many semi-polar organic groundwater contaminants such as chloroform (CF), non-polar compounds such as fuel constituents benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers (BTEX) or perchloroethene (PCE), or the polar fuel additive methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) belong to the class of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are persistent and toxic, and some are even considered to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic. At industrial or accidental spill sites, VOCs can accumulate in groundwater up to concentrations of several hundred mg/L. ",
