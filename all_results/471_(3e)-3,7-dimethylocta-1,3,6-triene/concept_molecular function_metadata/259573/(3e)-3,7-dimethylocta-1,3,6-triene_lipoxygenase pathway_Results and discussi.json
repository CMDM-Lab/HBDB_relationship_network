    "context": "The tobacco plants released VOCs in response to spraying with a conidial suspension of G. cichoracearum. The emissions increased immediately after infection, reaching their maximum 3 days after, before decreasing (data not shown). The volatile profile emitted by these infected plants differed quantitatively and qualitatively from that of the healthy plants. The main compounds detected in the VOCs blend from the infected plants were the terpene \u03b2-ocimene, the jasmonates MeJA and cis-jasmone, the lipoxygenase pathway derivative (E)-2-hexenal, and the shikimic acid derivative MeSA (Fig.\u00a01 ). As expected, an increase in (E)-2-hexenal emission was detected strating from the first hour after G. cichoracearum inoculation, and rapidly decreased within 24\u00a0h. (E)-2-hexenal belongs to the so called \u2018\u2018green leaf volatiles\u201d that are emitted almost instantaneously after damage in contrast to the delayed emission of induced volatiles. These C6-compounds have recently gained particular interest since they seem to be involved in the \u2018\u2018priming process\u2019\u2019 of undamaged leaves. ",

        "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is not directly mentioned in the context, but the lipoxygenase pathway is referenced through the emission of (E)-2-hexenal, a derivative of this pathway. The context discusses the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by tobacco plants in response to infection, highlighting the role of the lipoxygenase pathway in producing certain VOCs. However, the specific relationship between (3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and the lipoxygenase pathway is not established, as the former compound is not explicitly linked to the pathway's activity or products in the provided information.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the broader context of plant responses to infection and VOC emissions, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship.",
