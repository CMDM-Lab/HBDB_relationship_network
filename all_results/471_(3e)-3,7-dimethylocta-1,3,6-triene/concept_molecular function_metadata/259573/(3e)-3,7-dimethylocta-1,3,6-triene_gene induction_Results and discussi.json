    "context": "In contrast, MeJA emission reached its maximum 3 days after the treatment, and then decreased to basal levels. The emissions of both MeSA and volatile jasmonates from infected plants confirms that the SA and JA pathways are involved in plant responses against G. cichoracearum, as previously showed in Arabidopsis thaliana  . To determine the interference between the volatile compounds emitted from infected tobacco plants and those from the fungus, we also collected and identified the volatiles released from the conidia of G. cichoracearum. The conidia volatiles were characterised by the presence of C8-compounds, such as (E)-2-octenal, 1-octen-3-ol and (E)-2-octenol, which were only detected in the headspace from conidia, and not from infected plants.Effects of MeJA, (E)-2-hexenal and (E)-\u03b2-ocimene on tobacco powdery mildew infections and genes induction As compared with the controls, pre-treatment of tobacco plants with MeJA and (E)-2-hexenal used at the higher concentrations [2\u00a0mM and 5\u00a0mM for MeJA and from 5 to 25\u00a0mM for (E)-2-hexenal] induced a significant reduction in the severity of powdery mildew infections while pre-treatment with (E)-\u03b2-ocimene used at the higher concentration (0.18\u00a0mM) seemed to increase the infection severity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3 ). The three compounds did not affect the severity of tobacco powdery mildew infection when applied at the lower concentrations (Figs.\u00a02 and 3). Moreover, at all the tested concentrations, none of them seemed to show phytotoxic effects as observed during the visual examination of the infection. For each compound, the lowest concentration that promoted a significant variation in the severity of powdery mildew [2.0\u00a0mM MeJA, 5\u00a0mM (E)-2-hexenal and 0.18\u00a0mM (E)-\u03b2-ocimene] was used with the aim to investigate the accumulation of LOX, AOC and defensin genes transcripts by semi-quantitative analysis.

        "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is mentioned in the context of plant responses to pathogens, specifically regarding the induction of genes related to defense mechanisms. The study indicates that pre-treatment with this compound, along with others like MeJA and (E)-2-hexenal, leads to significant changes in the expression of genes associated with reducing the severity of powdery mildew infections. This suggests a direct relationship between the volatile compound and the induction of defense-related genes in tobacco plants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between (3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and gene induction, as the compound is shown to influence gene expression related to plant defense mechanisms against infections, supported by experimental evidence.",
