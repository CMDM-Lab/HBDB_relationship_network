    "context": "In contrast, MeJA emission reached its maximum 3 days after the treatment, and then decreased to basal levels. The emissions of both MeSA and volatile jasmonates from infected plants confirms that the SA and JA pathways are involved in plant responses against G. cichoracearum, as previously showed in Arabidopsis thaliana  . To determine the interference between the volatile compounds emitted from infected tobacco plants and those from the fungus, we also collected and identified the volatiles released from the conidia of G. cichoracearum. The conidia volatiles were characterised by the presence of C8-compounds, such as (E)-2-octenal, 1-octen-3-ol and (E)-2-octenol, which were only detected in the headspace from conidia, and not from infected plants.Effects of MeJA, (E)-2-hexenal and (E)-\u03b2-ocimene on tobacco powdery mildew infections and genes induction As compared with the controls, pre-treatment of tobacco plants with MeJA and (E)-2-hexenal used at the higher concentrations [2\u00a0mM and 5\u00a0mM for MeJA and from 5 to 25\u00a0mM for (E)-2-hexenal] induced a significant reduction in the severity of powdery mildew infections while pre-treatment with (E)-\u03b2-ocimene used at the higher concentration (0.18\u00a0mM) seemed to increase the infection severity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3 ). The three compounds did not affect the severity of tobacco powdery mildew infection when applied at the lower concentrations (Figs.\u00a02 and 3). Moreover, at all the tested concentrations, none of them seemed to show phytotoxic effects as observed during the visual examination of the infection. For each compound, the lowest concentration that promoted a significant variation in the severity of powdery mildew [2.0\u00a0mM MeJA, 5\u00a0mM (E)-2-hexenal and 0.18\u00a0mM (E)-\u03b2-ocimene] was used with the aim to investigate the accumulation of LOX, AOC and defensin genes transcripts by semi-quantitative analysis.

        "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is mentioned in the context of plant responses to infection by G. cichoracearum, where it is part of the volatile compounds emitted from infected plants. The study highlights the role of jasmonates and other volatiles in mediating plant defense mechanisms against infections. However, the specific relationship between (3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and the infection itself is not explicitly detailed, indicating a broader involvement of volatile compounds in plant defense rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as (3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is part of the discussion on plant responses to infection, but its specific role or interaction with the infection is not clearly defined.",
