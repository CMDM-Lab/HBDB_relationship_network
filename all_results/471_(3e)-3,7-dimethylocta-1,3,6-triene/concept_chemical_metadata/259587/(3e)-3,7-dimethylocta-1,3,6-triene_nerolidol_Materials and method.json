    "context": "The chloroplast transit peptides of the monoterpene synthases were predicted by ChloroP 1.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/) and excluded for the sequence comparison. Full length sequences of characterized sesquiterpene synthases as well as other M. truncatula terpene synthases were added to the sequence comparison. The sequence alignment was generated with Geneious Align using progressive pairwise alignment in which deduced amino acid sequence of MtEBOS (GenBank accession no. AAV36465) was aligned with those of Artemisia annua (3R)-linalool synthase (AAF13356); A. annua (E)-\u03b2-farnesene synthase (AAX39387); Antirrhinum majus (E)-\u03b2-ocimene synthase (AAO42614); A. majus nerolidol/linalool synthase (ABR24417); Arabidopsis thaliana (E)-\u03b2-ocimene synthase (AAN65379); Citrus limon (+)-limonene synthase 2 (AAM53946); C. limon (\u2212)-\u03b2-pinene synthase (AAM53945); C. limon \u03b3-terpinene synthase (AAM53943); Citrus unshiu (E)-\u03b2-ocimene synthase (BAD91046); Cinnamomum tenuipile geraniol synthase (CAD29734); Gossypium hirsutum (+)-\u03b4-cadinene synthase (AAX44034); Lavandula angustifolia (R)-limonene synthase (ABB73044); L. japonicus (E)-\u03b2-ocimene synthase (AAT86042); Mentha aquatica (\u2212)-3R-linalool synthase (AAL99381); Magnolia grandiflora \u03b1-terpineol synthase (ACC66282); Mentha spicata (\u2212)-4S-limonene synthase (AAC37366); M. truncatula \u03b2-caryophyllene synthase (AAV36464); M. truncatula nerolidol/geranyl linalool synthase (AAV36466); Nicotiana tabacum 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (AAA19216); Ocimum basilicum \u03b2-myrcene synthase (AAV63791); Perilla frutescens myrcene synthase (AAF76186); Phaseolus lunatus \u03b2-ocimene synthase (ABY65110); Salvia fruticosa cineole synthase (ABH07677); Salvia pomifera sabinene synthase (ABH07678); Salvia stenophylla 3-carene synthase (AAM89254); Solanum lycopersicum (R)-linalool synthase (AAX69063); Vitis vinifera (\u2212)-\u03b1-terpineol synthase (AAS79352). The unrooted tree was drawn in the Geneious Basic 3.6.2 program via the neighbor-joining method.RNA blot analysis Total RNA was extracted from collected leaf tissues using TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was loaded in each lane and separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. ",

        "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and nerolidol are both terpenes mentioned in the context of a sequence comparison of terpene synthases from various plant species. The context highlights the alignment of sequences related to different terpene synthases, including those that produce nerolidol. While they are part of the same biochemical pathway, the specific relationship or interaction between these two compounds is not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the broader category of terpenes and are mentioned in the context of terpene synthase sequence comparisons, but their specific relationship or functional interaction is not discussed.",
