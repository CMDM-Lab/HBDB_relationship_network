    "context": "In the control plants, the total VOCs emissions were almost 100% monoterpenes, whereas these were a much lower percentage in MeJA-treated plants (data not shown). Instead, the sesquiterpenes were the predominant compounds after MeJA treatment. These data are in agreement with those reported in cotton plants. Among the VOCs identified in the headspace of MeJA-treated tobacco plants, and as compared with the controls, significant differences were seen for the terpenes (E)-\u03b2-ocimene, (E,E)-2,6-dimethyl-1,3,5,7-octatetraene (cosmene), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (sulcatone), (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b1-bergamotene, \u03b1-farnesene, as well as for the JA metabolite cis-jasmone (Fig.\u00a07 ). After 48\u00a0h of treatment with MeJA, there were increases in the emissions of these compounds that were not detectable in the initial 0\u201324\u00a0h time period, when only (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene was detected. The emission of (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene showed its maximum increase 3 days after MeJA exposure, although significant differences were not seen in the 0\u201324\u00a0h and 24\u201348\u00a0h time intervals. (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene was frequently the most abundant sesquiterpene within many of these volatiles blends, and increased emissions of (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene have been seen in several plant systems, also after MeJA treatment.
