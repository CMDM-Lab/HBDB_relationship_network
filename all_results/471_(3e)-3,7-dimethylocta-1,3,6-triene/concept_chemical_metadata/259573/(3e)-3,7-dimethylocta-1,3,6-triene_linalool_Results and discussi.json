    "context": "They are believed to have roles as either direct defence agents or as signalling molecules. The emission of C6-compounds has never been seen in plants treated with MeJA, except for (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate.VOCs emission from MeJA-treated G. cichoracearum-infected tobacco plants The powdery mildew infection did not interfere with the global VOCs emission induced by MeJA. The compounds identified as emitted by G. cichoracearum were not detected in the MeJA-treated G. cichoracearum-infected tobacco plants, where instead we identified the majority of the volatile compounds seen in the MeJA-treated plants used as controls. In particular, among the volatiles, there were the terpenes linalool, (E)-\u03b2-ocimene, cosmene, sulcatone, (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene, \u03b1-bergamotene, \u03b1-farnesene, and the jasmonate cis-jasmone (Fig.\u00a08 ). These compounds, except (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-farnesene, were emitted from the tobacco leaves in the same percentages seen for MeJA-treated plants, with the same timing of release (the maximum increase in emission was 48\u00a0h after the treatment). Significant differences in emission (in terms of timing and amount) were detected for the sesquiterpenes (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene and \u03b1-farnesene. For example, (E)-\u03b2-caryophyllene was seen in high percentages in the 48\u00a0h\u201372\u00a0h time interval, as compared with the previous two sampling times (0\u201324\u00a0h, 24\u201348\u00a0h).

        "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and linalool are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from tobacco plants treated with jasmonic acid (MeJA) in response to powdery mildew infection. While the context highlights their presence among other terpenes released from the plants, it does not detail any specific interaction or functional relationship between these two compounds, indicating they are part of a broader response to stress rather than directly related to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are mentioned in the context of VOCs emitted from treated plants, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific roles in the defense mechanism.",
