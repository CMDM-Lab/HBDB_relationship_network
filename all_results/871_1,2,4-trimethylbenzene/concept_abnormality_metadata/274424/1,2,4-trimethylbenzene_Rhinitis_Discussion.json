    "context": "95% CI: 0.94\u20131.11). Results obtained by the mixed model were very similar to those obtained by the GEE model (data not shown). Using population-based data on air quality of French dwellings, we found an increasing risk of asthma and rhinitis in dwellings with high concentrations of the selected VOCs. n-Undecane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were individually significantly associated with increases in reported asthma and ethylbenzene, trichloroethylene, m/p- and o-xylene with increases in rhinitis. The risks of asthma and rhinitis increased significantly for any additional VOC with a concentration higher than the 3rd quartile in the dwelling, ORs of 1.07 and 1.04, respectively, were observed. Aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons were associated with a significant risk of asthma and halogenated hydrocarbons with a significant risk of rhinitis. Our health outcomes collected with a standardized questionnaire are consistent with previous findings. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with an increased risk of rhinitis. The study indicates that higher concentrations of this compound in dwellings correlate with a significant rise in reported cases of rhinitis, suggesting a direct link between exposure to 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and respiratory health issues, particularly rhinitis. This relationship is supported by statistical data showing odds ratios for rhinitis associated with VOC exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and rhinitis, as the study provides evidence of increased risk associated with VOC concentrations, indicating a clear relationship within the context of respiratory health.",
        "score": 4
