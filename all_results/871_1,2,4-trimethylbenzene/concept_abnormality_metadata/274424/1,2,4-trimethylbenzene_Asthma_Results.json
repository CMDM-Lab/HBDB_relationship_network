    "context": "Other confounders were also tested in the analyses, but, following the criteria selection detailed in the method section, did not remain in the final models. We devoted a particular attention to the proportion of time spent at home (median=69%) that beyond not being associated (p>30%) with the outcomes did not affect the statistical significance of VOCs when introduced in the models. Table 3 shows the confounder distributions. Including each binary VOC independently in a marginal model adjusted for confounders showed that n-undecane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were significantly associated with asthma with odds ratios (OR) of 2.02 (95% confidence interval: 1.18\u20133.46) and 2.10 (95% CI: 1.21\u20133.65), respectively. No other significant relationships were found ( Fig. 1). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) significantly associated with asthma. The study reports an odds ratio of 2.10, indicating that exposure to this compound is linked to an increased risk of developing asthma. This suggests a potential role of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene as a contributing factor in asthma pathogenesis, highlighting its relevance in respiratory health assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and asthma, supported by statistical evidence (odds ratio) indicating a significant association. This connection is critical in understanding environmental factors influencing asthma.",
        "score": 5
