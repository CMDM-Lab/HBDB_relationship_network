    "context": "The parameters K s and v max were estimated from such profiles by curve fitting using Eq. (10). Monod kinetic parameters for toluene, m-xylene, n-octane, and n-hexane could be obtained this way and compiled with literature data (Table 3) . For the other compounds, the flux was constant indicating no degradation activity (CFC-113, MTBE, and n-pentane), or flux versus concentration profiles were linear indicating first-order kinetics over the entire range of concentrations (cyclic alkanes, isooctane, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene), or they had too few data points to be interpreted (n-decane). Monod parameters could not be obtained in any of these cases.Batch experiments In control experiments using bottles without sand, gaseous concentrations of all VOCs except n-dodecane (data not shown) stayed within \u00b110% of the initial concentrations for 15 days (Fig. 6) . In abiotic controls, concentrations of all VOCs decreased between 0.5 and 5.5 h after VOC injection following first-order rate law (Fig. 6) with rate constants ranging between 0.13\u00b10.13 day\u22121 for methylcyclohexane and 0.91\u00b10.52 ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their degradation kinetics. However, the text primarily focuses on the kinetic parameters of other compounds, with no direct comparison or interaction between the two compounds discussed. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than any specific relationship or functional interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs and are part of the same study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relationships within the context provided.",
