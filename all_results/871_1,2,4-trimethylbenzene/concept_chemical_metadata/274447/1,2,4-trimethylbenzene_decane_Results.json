    "context": "In abiotic controls, concentrations of all VOCs decreased between 0.5 and 5.5 h after VOC injection following first-order rate law (Fig. 6) with rate constants ranging between 0.13\u00b10.13 day\u22121 for methylcyclohexane and 0.91\u00b10.52 day\u22121 for toluene (Table 2). The gaseous concentrations of n-dodecane and to a lesser extent also of n-decane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (data not shown) decreased in an erratic manner, suggesting condensation and sorption. No CO2 production or O2 consumption (data not shown) was found. Total losses in sterile sand within 14 days ranged between 5% for CFC-11 (Fig. 6) and 90% for m-xylene. In live sand, all compounds except n-octane and MTBE decreased with first-order kinetics between 0.5 and 5.5 h after injection. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and decane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose concentrations were observed to decrease over time after injection into abiotic controls. However, the specific interactions or relationships between these two compounds are not detailed, and their behavior is described in a general manner without direct comparison or functional relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are part of the same study on VOC behavior but lack a direct interaction or significant relationship in the context provided. They are mentioned together in the context of concentration changes but without further elaboration.",
        "score": 2
