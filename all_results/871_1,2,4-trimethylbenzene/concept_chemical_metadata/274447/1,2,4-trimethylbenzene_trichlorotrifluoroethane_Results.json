    "context": "The parameters K s and v max were estimated from such profiles by curve fitting using Eq. (10). Monod kinetic parameters for toluene, m-xylene, n-octane, and n-hexane could be obtained this way and compiled with literature data (Table 3) . For the other compounds, the flux was constant indicating no degradation activity (CFC-113, MTBE, and n-pentane), or flux versus concentration profiles were linear indicating first-order kinetics over the entire range of concentrations (cyclic alkanes, isooctane, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene), or they had too few data points to be interpreted (n-decane). Monod parameters could not be obtained in any of these cases.Batch experiments In control experiments using bottles without sand, gaseous concentrations of all VOCs except n-dodecane (data not shown) stayed within \u00b110% of the initial concentrations for 15 days (Fig. 6) . In abiotic controls, concentrations of all VOCs decreased between 0.5 and 5.5 h after VOC injection following first-order rate law (Fig. 6) with rate constants ranging between 0.13\u00b10.13 day\u22121 for methylcyclohexane and 0.91\u00b10.52 ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and trichlorotrifluoroethane are mentioned among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their degradation activity. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between these two compounds. The focus is primarily on the kinetic parameters of other VOCs, with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene noted for first-order kinetics, while trichlorotrifluoroethane is included in a list of compounds without specific degradation data.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are part of a broader discussion on VOCs, but there is no detailed interaction or functional relationship established between them in the context provided.",
