    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both categorized as aromatic hydrocarbons and included in the assessment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in dwellings. They contribute to the global VOC score, which quantifies air pollutants based on their elevated concentrations. However, the context does not provide specific details on their individual interactions or health effects beyond their classification as part of the same group of compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both compounds are mentioned together in the context of VOCs and air quality assessment, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
