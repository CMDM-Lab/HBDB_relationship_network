    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 1-methoxy-2-propanol are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to the global VOC score, which quantifies air pollutants in dwellings. They are included in separate classifications of VOCs: 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene as an aromatic hydrocarbon and 1-methoxy-2-propanol as a glycol ether. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between these two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are mentioned in the context of VOC categorization but lack a detailed discussion of their interactions or specific significance in relation to each other.",
