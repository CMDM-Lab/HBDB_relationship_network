Marginal models did not converge for 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate, which had concentrations below the limit of detection in most dwellings. RCS functions showed non-linear significant associations only for n-undecane (p=0.01) and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (p=0.03), confirming the results obtained with the binary variables ( Table 4). The adjusted marginal model highlighted a significant positive association between asthma and the global VOC score, with an OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00\u20131.13), i.e. a risk of disease 1.07 times higher for 1 additional VOC with a high exposure level ( Table 5).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit significant associations with asthma. The study reports non-linear significant associations for both compounds, indicating that higher concentrations of these VOCs are linked to increased asthma risk. The statistical significance of their associations suggests a potential relationship in the context of respiratory health, particularly concerning asthma prevalence.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane, as both are shown to have statistically significant associations with asthma risk. The context provides evidence of their relevance in respiratory health, although the exact nature of their interaction is not deeply explored.",
