    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is categorized as an aromatic hydrocarbon, while aliphatic hydrocarbons refer to a different class of organic compounds. The mention of both terms occurs within the framework of a global VOC score, which aggregates various types of volatile organic compounds, including both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and aliphatic hydrocarbons beyond their classification as different types of VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are part of the broader category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) but lack a detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
