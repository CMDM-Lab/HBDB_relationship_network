    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are included in the analysis of air pollutants within dwellings. They are part of distinct groups of VOCs, with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene classified as an aromatic hydrocarbon and undecane as an aliphatic hydrocarbon. However, the context does not provide any specific interaction or relationship between the two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs and their inclusion in the overall VOC score analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane are mentioned together in the context of VOC categorization but lack a direct interaction or significant relationship beyond their classification as air pollutants.",
        "score": 2
