    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is categorized as one of the aromatic hydrocarbons included in the assessment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in dwellings. The study groups various VOCs by type, indicating that 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is part of the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons, which also includes other compounds like benzene and toluene. However, the specific interactions or implications of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene within the context of health outcomes are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is mentioned as part of the aromatic hydrocarbons category without a detailed discussion of its specific relationship to health outcomes or interactions with other VOCs.",
