    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and acetaldehyde are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are included in separate classifications of air pollutants. The study focuses on the global VOC score, which aggregates various VOCs, including aromatic hydrocarbons like 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and aldehydes like acetaldehyde. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or health effects in relation to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the broader category of VOCs analyzed in the study. However, their relationship is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a significant interaction.",
