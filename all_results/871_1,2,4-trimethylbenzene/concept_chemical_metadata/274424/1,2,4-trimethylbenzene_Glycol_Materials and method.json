    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and glycol are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to the global VOC score, which quantifies air pollutants in dwellings. While they are included in separate classifications of VOCs (aromatic hydrocarbons for 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and glycol ethers for glycol), there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between them beyond their classification as air pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are part of broader categories of VOCs affecting health indices, but their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed in the context.",
