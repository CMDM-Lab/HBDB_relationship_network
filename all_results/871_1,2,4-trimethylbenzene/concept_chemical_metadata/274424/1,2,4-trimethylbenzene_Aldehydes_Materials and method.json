    "context": "The global VOC score was then defined as the sum of the categorized VOCs. As a result, the global VOC score is the number of air pollutants in the dwellings for which elevated (>3rd quartile value) concentrations were found. In the models, the global VOC score, which ranged 0\u201320, was fitted as a continuous variable. Five specific VOC scores were built using a similar approach, summing VOCs by type: aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, o-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene and styrene), aliphatic hydrocarbons (n-decane, n-undecane), halogenated hydrocarbons (trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene), glycol ethers (1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and 2-butoxyethylacetate) and aldehydes (formaldehyde, acroleine, acetaldehyde and hexaldehyde). Using GEE, we analyzed adjusted associations between health indices and each VOC and each VOC score. For consistency, all models were adjusted for the same confounders. This decision was also justified by the fact that health outcomes (asthma and rhinitis) share many risk factors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is categorized as an aromatic hydrocarbon among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while aldehydes are listed as a separate category of VOCs. Both are included in a broader analysis of air pollutants and their associations with health indices. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and aldehydes, indicating they are simply part of a larger classification of VOCs without further elaboration on their interrelation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are part of the same study on VOCs and their health impacts, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
