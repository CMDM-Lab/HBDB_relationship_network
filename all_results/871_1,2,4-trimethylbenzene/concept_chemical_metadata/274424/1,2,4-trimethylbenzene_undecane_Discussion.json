    "context": "95% CI: 0.94\u20131.11). Results obtained by the mixed model were very similar to those obtained by the GEE model (data not shown). Using population-based data on air quality of French dwellings, we found an increasing risk of asthma and rhinitis in dwellings with high concentrations of the selected VOCs. n-Undecane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were individually significantly associated with increases in reported asthma and ethylbenzene, trichloroethylene, m/p- and o-xylene with increases in rhinitis. The risks of asthma and rhinitis increased significantly for any additional VOC with a concentration higher than the 3rd quartile in the dwelling, ORs of 1.07 and 1.04, respectively, were observed. Aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons were associated with a significant risk of asthma and halogenated hydrocarbons with a significant risk of rhinitis. Our health outcomes collected with a standardized questionnaire are consistent with previous findings. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with increased risks of asthma and rhinitis in dwellings with high concentrations of these substances. The study highlights their individual significance in contributing to respiratory health issues, indicating a shared relevance in the context of air quality and health outcomes related to VOC exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane, as both are linked to increased respiratory health risks. The context provides evidence of their association with asthma and rhinitis, indicating a clear relationship within the study's findings.",
        "score": 4
