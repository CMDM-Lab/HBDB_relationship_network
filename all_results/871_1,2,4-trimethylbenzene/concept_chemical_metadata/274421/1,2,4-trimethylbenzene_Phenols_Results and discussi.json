    "context": "The group located in PC1 positive comprises the samples corresponding to the healthy individuals (control). The group located in PC1 negative and PC2 (27.14% of the total variability) corresponds to the breast cancer patients. These results showed that the set of cases can be divided into two groups according to the clinical condition of the subjects. The variables phenol, 3-heptanone, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene seems to play an important role in healthy individuals group (control). Possible biomarkers of breast cancer patients may be selected from heptanal, dimethyl disulfide and 2-methyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, respectively. The present study showed that SPME coupled to GC\u2013qMS is a simple, rapid, sensitive and solvent-free method useful for the establishment of urinary volatile metabolomic pattern characteristic for breast cancer patients and normal subjects (cancer-free). A CAR/PDMS fiber was found to be more sensitive for volatile metabolites than other coating phases. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and phenols are mentioned as variables analyzed in a study comparing urinary volatile metabolites between healthy individuals and breast cancer patients. While both compounds are part of the metabolomic profile, the specific relationship or interaction between them is not detailed. They are identified as relevant to the study but do not exhibit a direct connection or shared function within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and phenols are included in the analysis of volatile metabolites, but their relationship is not explicitly discussed or defined in the context.",
        "score": 2
