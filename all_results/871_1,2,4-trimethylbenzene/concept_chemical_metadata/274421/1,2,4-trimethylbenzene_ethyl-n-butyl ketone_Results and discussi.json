    "context": "The group located in PC1 positive comprises the samples corresponding to the healthy individuals (control). The group located in PC1 negative and PC2 (27.14% of the total variability) corresponds to the breast cancer patients. These results showed that the set of cases can be divided into two groups according to the clinical condition of the subjects. The variables phenol, 3-heptanone, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene seems to play an important role in healthy individuals group (control). Possible biomarkers of breast cancer patients may be selected from heptanal, dimethyl disulfide and 2-methyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, respectively. The present study showed that SPME coupled to GC\u2013qMS is a simple, rapid, sensitive and solvent-free method useful for the establishment of urinary volatile metabolomic pattern characteristic for breast cancer patients and normal subjects (cancer-free). A CAR/PDMS fiber was found to be more sensitive for volatile metabolites than other coating phases. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and ethyl-n-butyl ketone are mentioned as part of a study investigating volatile metabolites in breast cancer patients and healthy controls. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. While both compounds are part of the broader analysis of volatile organic compounds, their specific roles or connections in the context of breast cancer are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and ethyl-n-butyl ketone are included in the study of volatile metabolites but lack a detailed relationship or interaction in the context provided. They are part of a larger analysis without specific connections.",
        "score": 2
