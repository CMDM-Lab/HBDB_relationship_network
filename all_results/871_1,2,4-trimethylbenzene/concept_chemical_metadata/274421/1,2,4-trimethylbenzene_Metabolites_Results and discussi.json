    "context": "The fragment-ion m/z values of the identified urinary metabolites with the highest abundance within each fragmentation pattern, the matching percentage of the NIST library and their frequency of occurrence in cancer patients and normal controls were listed in Table 1 . One-way ANOVA, (p <0.05) was carried out for both groups using SPSS version 17.0. The excretion values of all 79 volatile metabolites were compared between breast cancer group and the control group. The difference in levels of six from 79 metabolites identified including, 3-heptanone, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, (\u2212)-4-carene, dimethyl disulfide, 2-methoxythiophene and phenol, were statistically significant (p <0.05) in cancer patients and control groups while others did not show any significant differences (Table 2 ) The high inter-individual variability in urinary profiles and their large complexity make any attempt of visual comparison of these spectra an unsuccessful task. Applying, multivariate analysis allows to find consistent variation patterns within the dataset. In order to study the principal sources of variation among results, detect sample clustering and possible outliers, and to establish if the cancer patients could be distinguished from healthy individuals, exploratory principal component analysis was applied to the GC\u2013qMS peak area obtained for the urinary volatile metabolites of both groups. PCA is an unsupervized projection method used to visualize the dataset and display the similarity and difference. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as one of the urinary metabolites analyzed in a study comparing cancer patients to healthy controls. The study highlights significant differences in the excretion levels of certain metabolites, including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker in distinguishing between these two groups. The analysis indicates that this metabolite, among others, may be relevant in the context of cancer diagnosis or monitoring.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and metabolites, as the study provides statistical evidence of its differing levels in cancer patients versus controls, indicating its potential relevance as a biomarker.",
        "score": 4
