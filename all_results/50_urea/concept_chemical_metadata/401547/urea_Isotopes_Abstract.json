    "context": "[1] 3. Nitrogen absorption (76%, SD 4; n = 3) was not significantly different between groups. [2] Apparent urea balance was significantly increased and became positive in the group receiving the formula with the higher proportion of non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen. [3] Nitrogen retention, however, was significantly depressed in this group, indicating decreased efficiency of nitrogen utilization at this level of non-protein nitrogen despite an enhanced urea salvage. [1] 4. The enrichment of the 15N label in urinary urea at isotopic steady state was significantly reduced in infants receiving the highest urea-containing formula, presumably due to the dilution of 15N-labelled urea by dietary urea. [2] No difference, however, was found in the enrichment of the 15N label in urinary ammonia. [3] Rates of \u00ce\u00b1-amino nitrogen flux, protein synthesis and protein breakdown calculated from the ammonia labelling did not differ significantly between groups. Driving under the influence of alcohol is a global public health problem and impaired drivers are responsible for many road-traffic crashes and deaths on the roads. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and isotopes are related through the study of nitrogen retention and the enrichment of 15N-labeled urea in infants consuming different formulas. The research indicates that the presence of dietary urea can dilute the isotopic label in urinary urea, affecting the measurement of nitrogen utilization efficiency. This highlights the interaction between urea metabolism and isotopic labeling in assessing nitrogen balance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and isotopes, as the study provides evidence of how dietary urea influences the enrichment of isotopes in urinary urea, indicating a clear relationship in the context of nitrogen metabolism.",
