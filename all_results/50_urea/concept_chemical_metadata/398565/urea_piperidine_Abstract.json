    "context": "[5] This structure-based design effort led to the successful discovery of a series of ketobenzimidazoles, represented by compound 2 (Fig.\u00c2\u00a01), as unique FAAH inhibitors. [6] Through extensive structural, mechanistic, and pharmacological characterization, we demonstrated that these ketobenzimidazoles are noncovalent FAAH binders with inhibition potencies comparable to those of covalent inhibitors. [7] In addition, these inhibitors possess excellent selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties. [8] This report describes the discovery and mechanism of action studies of a piperidine-urea identified by HTS as well as a unique series of potent noncovalent FAAH inhibitors. [1] To elucidate the molecular basis of inhibition for the HTS hits, we carried out X-ray structural analysis of apo FAAH as well as FAAH in complex with various inhibitors. [2] Because of the difficulties in expressing sufficient amounts of soluble human FAAH enzyme, we used an N-terminal truncated form of rat FAAH for the X-ray crystallographic studies. [3] Note that human and rat FAAH have the same catalytic triad of Ser241-Ser217-Lys142 and also have a similar active site that bears six mutations from rat to human (i.e., Leu192Phe, Phe194Tyr, Ala377Thr, Ser435Asn, Ile491Val, and Val495Met).

        "summary": "In this context, urea and piperidine are mentioned as components of a compound identified through high-throughput screening (HTS) as a potential inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The relationship is primarily structural, as piperidine is part of the chemical structure of the urea compound that exhibits inhibitory activity. However, the specific interactions or functional roles of urea and piperidine in the mechanism of action are not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea and piperidine are part of a compound that acts as a FAAH inhibitor, indicating a structural relationship. However, the context does not provide extensive details on their interaction or significance beyond their inclusion in the compound.",
