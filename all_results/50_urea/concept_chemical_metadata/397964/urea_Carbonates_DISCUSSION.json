    "context": "[11] Certainly the high level of CPS III activity in the intestine of the largemouth bass and bowfin suggests that while an active intestinal O-UC during digestion is not universal in fish species, it may be present in multiple distantly related species. [12] Furthermore, perhaps the conclusion that adult ammoniotelic teleost fish lack an active O-UC and that preservation of the O-UC genes is a result of embryonic urea production (; ) has been based on studies focusing only on the liver, although O-UC enzymes in the skeletal muscle of rainbow trout were detectable but not inducible under several conditions . [13] Studies examining the intestine during digestion may reveal a conditionally active O-UC and disclose an additional evolutionary rationale for the preservation of O-UC enzyme expression in adult ammoniotelic fish. [1] Although the overall contribution of urea excretion to the total of ammonia plus urea remains relatively low even in feeding [consistent with fasted observations in the present study and a previous study ], the delayed and discontinuous appearance of urea and its apparent correspondence with the first appearance of fecal matter and carbonate pellets (30 h following the consumption of a meal) suggests an important role for the intestine in this process. [2] Our measurements of urea production rates in isolated intestinal tissues confirmed that this tissue has the ability to produce urea from ammonia and the rates of production of urea in vitro appear to match reasonably well with excretion rates observed in vivo. [3] [The increase in mucosal urea production comparing fasted and fed tissue was ~30 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 along with an average increase in serosal urea appearance of ~10 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192 (Fig. 2C,D).] [4] With an average total intestinal area of 150 cm2 in a 100 g fish, the total urea production capabilities of the fed intestinal\n\ntissue over fasted controls was ~60 \u00ce\u00bcmol N kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, in accord with the overall increase in urea excretion by the animal in vivo (Fig. 1B).

        "summary": "In this context, urea and carbonates are indirectly related through the digestive processes in fish, particularly in the context of urea production and excretion. The study highlights the role of the intestine in producing urea from ammonia, with the delayed appearance of urea corresponding to the presence of fecal matter and carbonate pellets. This suggests a potential link between urea metabolism and carbonate formation during digestion, although the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea production is discussed in relation to digestive processes that may involve carbonates, but the direct relationship between urea and carbonates is not explicitly detailed.",
