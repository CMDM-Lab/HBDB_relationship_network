[5] Data from prior studies in this regard are limited. [6] Kajimura et al.  showed that by suturing the anus of trout, urea-N excretion to the water was decreased by 30% during digestion, accounting for roughly 34 \u00ce\u00bcmol N kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, which is similar to the increase in urea excretion seen in the present study (39 \u00ce\u00bcmol N kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191; Fig. 1B), and the marble goby [~50 \u00ce\u00bcmol N kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ]. [7] One future direction for studies with midshipmen could be to conduct similar suturing experiments and/or divided chamber and urinary/rectal catheter experiments that separate the various components of excretion, as has been done for the related toadfish .

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its production and excretion in fish, specifically the marble goby. The study highlights the differences in urea production between fasted and fed states, with specific measurements provided. However, the term 'marble' appears only as part of the species name 'marble goby' and does not indicate a direct relationship with urea beyond its biological context. Thus, while both terms are related to the same biological study, their connection is not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as urea is a metabolic product discussed in the context of the marble goby, but there is no detailed interaction or functional relationship between urea and the term 'marble' itself.",
