    "context": " [8] The appearance rate of urea in the mucosal saline was higher in fasted\n\nfish exposed to antibiotics compared with fasted fish and similar to concentrations found in fed fish with each respective mucosal treatment.  [9] Once again, exposure to high glutamine significantly reduced the appearance rate of urea in the mucosal solution; however, values remained above those seen in both fasted and fed fish (38.9\u00c2\u00b14.9 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192; Fig. 2C). [10] Treatment with high ammonia and high glutamine partially recovered the appearance rate of urea in the lumen (49.4\u00c2\u00b14.1 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192), but not back to control saline values as seen without antibiotic treatment (Fig. 2C). [11] The serosal appearance rate of urea was influenced only by condition, and not mucosal saline treatment. [12] The serosal appearance rate of urea in fasted fish was significantly lower than the serosal appearance rate in fed fish, while treatment of fasted fish with antibiotics produced an intermediate appearance rate that was similar to both fasted and fed tissue values (Fig. 2D). [1] Intestinal tissue urea and ammonia production in the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) by tissues obtained from fasted (7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 days; N=6) or fed (N=6) animals and fasted (7\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 days; N=5) animals incubated with antibiotics that have been exposed to four different mucosal salines (control, high ammonia, high glutamine, and high ammonia + high glutamine).

        "summary": "In this context, urea and saline are related through the study of urea appearance rates in mucosal saline solutions of fasted fish exposed to antibiotics. The results indicate that the presence of saline influences the urea concentration, with variations observed based on the fish's feeding status and treatment conditions. Saline serves as a medium for measuring urea levels, highlighting its role in the physiological response of fish to different dietary and treatment conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and saline, as the study provides evidence of how saline affects urea appearance rates in fish under various conditions. The relationship is supported by quantitative data, indicating the influence of saline on urea levels.",
