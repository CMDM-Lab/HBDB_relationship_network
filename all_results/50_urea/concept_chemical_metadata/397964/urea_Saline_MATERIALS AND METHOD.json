    "context": "[12] Sections were then examined with a confocal scanning system (Zeiss LSM 510, AxioImager.M1, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Toronto, Canada) equipped with an argon laser. [13] Images were collected using ZEN imaging software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) at 40\u00c3\u2014 magnification, under oil immersion unless otherwise stated. [1] Whole-animal ammonia (JNH3/NH4+) and urea (JUrea) fluxes to the water were examined using a repeated-measures one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's post hoc test. [2] In vitro tissue urea transport/production was examined using a two-way ANOVA with condition (fasted, fed, fasted + antibiotics) and saline treatment (see Table 1) as factors, followed by appropriate post hoc testing (Tukey's test). [3] Tissue enzyme activity levels and mRNA expression levels were examined using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's post hoc test.  [1] During the 6 h control period before the consumption of a meal, JNH3/NH4+ and JUrea rates were not significantly different and were collapsed into a single control value of 83.6\u00c2\u00b119.9 and 4.1\u00c2\u00b11.7 \u00ce\u00bcmol N kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, respectively, resulting in a pre-prandial percent urea-N excretion of 4.8\u00c2\u00b12.0% of total N (Fig. 1).  [2] A spike in JNH3/NH4+ immediately after feeding was most likely due to the stress of the feeding protocol. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and saline are examined in relation to tissue urea transport and production under different conditions, including saline treatment. The study investigates how saline influences urea fluxes and enzyme activity, indicating a potential interaction between saline treatment and urea metabolism. However, the specifics of their relationship are not deeply explored beyond their inclusion in the experimental design.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea and saline are part of the same experimental framework assessing urea transport and production. While saline treatment is a factor in the study, the direct interaction or specific impact of saline on urea metabolism is not thoroughly detailed.",
