Detection of this activity forms the basis of the rapid urease tests (CLO test, Pylori Tek test, Hp Fast) and radiolabeled carbon (13C, 14C) urea breath tests. The urea-gel test is a qualitative analysis of the urease activity in a small sample of gastric mucosa, i.e., a test of focal gastric urease activity. On the other hand, the [13C]urea breath test quantitatively measures the urease activity in a larger portion of the stomach and is considered a global test. In our study, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the urea-membrane test at 1 hour were 98.0%, 93.9%, and 94.2% and 97.9%, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and carbon are related through the use of carbon isotopes in breath tests to detect urease activity, particularly in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. The urea breath test utilizes radiolabeled carbon (13C, 14C) to measure the presence of urease, which breaks down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, indicating bacterial activity. This highlights the biochemical interaction where urea serves as a substrate for urease, producing carbon as a byproduct, thus linking the two terms in a diagnostic context.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and carbon, as the context discusses the use of carbon isotopes in urea breath tests to assess urease activity, demonstrating a clear biochemical relationship supported by diagnostic applications.",
