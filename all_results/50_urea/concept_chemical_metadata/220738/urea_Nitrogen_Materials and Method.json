    "context": "[14] The formula takes into account the number of treatments per week and urea rebound by using Daugirdas's eKt/V correction of the Sp Kt/V . [15] While the Gotch Std Kt/V has not been validated against direct dialysate quantification to determine whether it accurately quantifies clearances, it has been empirically validated in a comparative study of CHD, NHD and SHDHD . [16] With the HD patients, traditional three-point UKM was carried out ; postdialysis blood sampling utilized 15 s slow flow methodology to obviate urea dilution by recirculation. [17] Derived from the urea generation is the weight normalized protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance (nPNA; g/kg/d) also known as the normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) . [18] With the APD patients, a 24 h collection of peritoneal effluent was obtained and the total urea and protein losses measured. [19] From these, the daily urea clearance was calculated and the Std Kt/V derived employing the Watson equation for V. [20] The nPNA was also derived from dialysate urea and protein losses and body weight (nPNA, g/kg/d). ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are closely related through the discussion of nitrogen balance in patients undergoing dialysis. Urea is a key nitrogenous waste product formed from protein metabolism, and its clearance is used to assess nitrogen appearance rates in the body. The normalized protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance (nPNA) is derived from urea measurements, indicating the importance of urea in evaluating nitrogen status in patients.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and nitrogen, as urea is a primary nitrogenous waste product, and their relationship is supported by empirical data regarding nitrogen balance in dialysis patients.",
        "score": 4
