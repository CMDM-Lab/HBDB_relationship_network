    "context": "[4] It is hypothesized that serum cystatin C levels are influenced by the method and intensity of dialysis received. [1] Design: This is a cross-sectional pilot study of cystatin C in functionally anephric dialysis patients. [2] It was measured predialysis in 14 patients on conventional (3 to 5 h, 3 \u00c3\u2014 wk) hemodialysis; eight on nocturnal hemodialysis (three to seven nights, 6 to 8 h); three on daily hemodialysis (6 d, 1\u00c2\u00bd to 2\u00c2\u00bd h); and 10 on automated peritoneal dialysis. [3] All had urea kinetic studies and values for single pool Kt/V (Sp Kt/V), standard weekly Kt/V (Std Kt/V), and protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (nPNA; g/kg/d). [4] C reactive protein (CRP; mg/L) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; mIU/L) were measured as factors known to influence cystatin C. [1] Results: There was no correlation between cystatin C and Sp Kt/V, but there was a significant inverse linear correlation with Std Kt/V and there were significant differences between treatment modalities in cystatin C levels and in Std Kt/V. [2] The estimation of cystatin C was reliable and stable over 3 to 6 wk and its levels uninfluenced by nPNA, CRP, or TSH. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are related through the measurement of nitrogen appearance in patients undergoing dialysis. Urea is a nitrogenous waste product formed in the liver from the breakdown of proteins, and its levels are often assessed in relation to nitrogen balance in patients. The study includes urea kinetic studies, which evaluate nitrogen metabolism and excretion in dialysis patients, highlighting the importance of urea as a key indicator of nitrogen status in the body.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and nitrogen, as urea is a primary nitrogenous waste product, and the study discusses its role in nitrogen metabolism in dialysis patients. The relationship is supported by the context of urea kinetic studies, indicating a clear relevance.",
