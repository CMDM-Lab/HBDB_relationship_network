[2] A series of 10 random geometries was then computed, and each was subjected to dynamic simulated annealing using Discover (Accelrys). [3] Similarly, 10 random geometry models of -4GlcNAc\u00ce\u00b21-6Gal\u00ce\u00b21-linked poly-LacNAc, also containing five LacNAc repeats, were generated and subjected to simulated annealing.  [1] Extraction of Ricin-binding Glycoproteins\u00e2\u20ac\u201dTo extract all types of membrane-associated glycoconjugates, osmotically lysed T. brucei cells were completely solubilized in 8 m urea and 3% SDS for 30 min before dilution of the extract and addition of ricin coupled to agarose.  [2] Rechromatography of the unbound fraction showed that the majority of the ricin-binding material was captured in the first round of chromatography (data not shown).  [3] The native glycoproteins eluted from the ricin-coupled agarose range in apparent molecular mass from 35 to more than 188 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1).  [4] Reduction with 1 m dithiothreitol resulted in the disappearance of bands over 188 kDa and the appearance of smaller molecular mass glycoproteins (Fig. 1A, lane 2), suggesting disulfide linkages between some of the constituent glycoproteins.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a solubilizing agent in the extraction process of membrane-associated glycoconjugates from T. brucei cells. The presence of urea aids in breaking down cellular structures, allowing for the effective extraction of glycoproteins that are linked to glycoconjugates. However, the specific biochemical relationship between urea and glycoconjugates is not elaborated upon beyond this extraction method.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is directly involved in the extraction of glycoconjugates, indicating a functional relationship. However, the context does not provide detailed insights into the biochemical interactions or significance of this relationship.",
