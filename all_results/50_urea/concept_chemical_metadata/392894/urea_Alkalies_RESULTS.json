    "context": " [9] C, the inner membrane fraction from the 50% sucrose cushion was subjected to alkali extraction at pH 11.3 or treatment with 5 m urea. [10] All samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. [11] D, in vitrotranslation was carried out with liposomes, ISO membrane vesicles, or RSO membrane vesicles as indicated, and the vesicles were isolated by centrifugation on a 50% sucrose cushion and washed with 5m urea. [1] Integral membrane proteins are not extracted by 5 m urea or at alkaline pH, and accordingly, LacY synthesized in vitroin the presence of ISO vesicles fractionates with the membranes even after treatment with urea or alkali (Fig. 1, B andC). [2] Thus, LacY synthesized in vitro appears to integrate into the membrane. [3] Furthermore, when in vitrotranscription/translation is carried out in the presence of liposomes or RSO vesicles rather than ISO vesicles, little or no membrane-associated LacY is observed (Fig. 1 D). [4] The findings confirm previous observations  showing that LacY insertion not only requires other membrane components (e.g. the SecYEG complex) but that insertion must occur vectorially from the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane.

        "summary": "In this context, urea and alkalies are mentioned in relation to their roles in the extraction and analysis of integral membrane proteins. Urea is used at a concentration of 5 m to treat samples, while alkali extraction is performed at a pH of 11.3. Both treatments are part of the methodology to investigate the properties of membrane proteins, specifically their resistance to extraction by these agents. However, the relationship is primarily methodological rather than functional or biochemical.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between urea and alkalies, as both are used in the same experimental context for protein extraction. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or a shared biochemical function.",
