    "context": "Additionally, ammonium in a concentration ranging from 45 to 240 \u03bcmol/L (average 110 \u03bcmol/L) has been detected in the hepatic bile in healthy humans undergoing a cholecystectomy for gallstones. The fate of the ammonium present in the bile is unclear, but it may be released into the intestinal lumen being subsequently transported by the portal vein to the liver. Human hepatocytes use ammonia and bicarbonate to form carbamoylphosphate in the mitochondria, initiating the urea cycle reactions. In individuals with normal liver function, hepatocytes seem to have a remarkable functional reserve, and urea synthesis per gram of liver tissue increases rapidly following major hepatectomy, so that liver resections of up to 70%\u201380% are generally well tolerated and arterial ammonium concentration remains unchanged. In contrast, much smaller liver resections precipitate liver failure in patients with underlying liver disease. Normal human liver also shows glutamine synthetase and glutaminase activity, being therefore capable of glutamine synthesis and hydrolysis.Kidney Human kidney also plays a fundamental role in ammonium homeostasis. Normal kidney cells produce free ammonium ions that are either excreted into the urine or released into the renal vein. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium are interconnected through the urea cycle, where ammonia (derived from ammonium) is utilized by hepatocytes to synthesize carbamoylphosphate, a key step in urea production. The liver's ability to convert ammonium into urea is crucial for nitrogen metabolism and detoxification, highlighting their significant biochemical relationship in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and ammonium, as the context discusses their roles in the urea cycle and nitrogen metabolism, supported by physiological processes in the liver. However, while the relationship is clear, it lacks extensive quantitative data to achieve a higher score.",
