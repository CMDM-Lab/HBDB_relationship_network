    "context": "Discussion The urea breath test has been established as an important tool in the pretreatment diagnosis of H. pylori infection (2,7\u20139,19\u201320). It has been convincingly argued that in addition to primary diagnosis, an accepted indication for such a noninvasive test is the follow up to eradication therapy. Indeed, a number of studies have shown it to be equally efficacious in post-treatment diagnosis (21\u201323). The ability of the urea breath test to accurately diagnose H. pylori status 1 month after eradication therapy confers several advantages, including: the risk of ulcer recurrence before treatment outcome can be determined is low (treatment failures are relatively common), recurrent symptoms can be treated with assurance of the H. pylori status and the shorter wait provides an element of comfort to the physician and patient. A consensus statement recently has advocated the use of urea breath tests as the best noninvasive test for diagnosis of H. pylori infection (24). In this study we have shown that Helikit\u2122 offers excellent clinical sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. These performance characteristics obviate the need for invasive endoscopy in uncomplicated cases, and prove that a single test is sufficient for primary diagnosis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to the urea breath test, a diagnostic tool for H. pylori infection. However, the term 'Elements' is not explicitly defined or connected to urea within the provided text. While urea is a significant compound in the context of the breath test, the term 'Elements' lacks a clear relationship or relevance to urea in this discussion.",
