    "context": "[6] At given incubation times, aliquots were removed, quenched with an equal volume of 4% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by HPLC. [7] Heat denaturation was performed by submitting aliquots of the sample in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to increasing temperatures of 45, 55, and 65\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C for 1 h and finally quenching the sample with equal volumes of 4% trifluoroacetic acid. [1] The fluorescence spectra of LCI were measured with a 650\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer) scanning from 300 to 450 nm with excitation at 280 nm. [2] LCI was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1m, pH 8.4) containing 0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea and GdnHCl). [3] Denaturation of LCI was performed at 23\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C for 20 h. [4] The final concentration of LCI was 2 \u00ce\u00bcm. [5] Fluorescence intensities of blank samples containing equivalent concentrations of the denaturant were also analyzed and subtracted from readings of the LCI samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and 2-mercaptoethanol are both mentioned as denaturants used in the heat denaturation process of LCI in a Tris-HCl buffer. Urea and 2-mercaptoethanol are employed to disrupt protein structures, but their specific roles or interactions in the denaturation process are not elaborated upon. They are part of a broader experimental setup aimed at analyzing protein behavior under denaturing conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as urea and 2-mercaptoethanol are both used as denaturants in the same experimental context, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their shared function in protein denaturation.",
