    "context": "[3] Deletion of the p-hydroxy-group on the aromatic moiety (O-1986) resulted in similar decreases, although some affinity for CB1 receptors was retained. [4] Substitution of an m-chloro for the m-methoxy in arvanil led to O-2094, a compound that had reasonable CB1receptor affinity and stimulated GTP\u00ce\u00b3S binding [Emax= 15% stimulation (8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c20), EC50 = 131 nM (5\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1900), reversed by 2 nM SR141716A] slightly less potently than arvanil. [5] When a second 3-chloro-(4-hydroxy)benzyl group was substituted on the nitrogen, the resulting analog (O-2093) exerted a significant inhibition of GTP\u00ce\u00b3S binding, which was not sensitive to the CB1antagonist SR141716A (2 nM, data not shown) or to the FAAH inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 \u00ce\u00bcM, data not shown). [1] Conversion of the amide group in arvanil to a urea in O-1987 decreased both CB1 affinity and GTP\u00ce\u00b3S binding activity. [2] When the urea was changed to a thiourea (O-2095), CB1 receptor affinity was reduced further. [3] The introduction of a chlorine atom in O-2095, which yielded O-2109, the thiourea analog of O-2094, increased the activity of this compound in the CB1 binding assay but did not restore the activity in the GTP\u00ce\u00b3S binding assay (Table 1). [4] Finally, introduction of a 4\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-morpholinobutyryl group on the p-hydroxybenzyl group of arvanil, which yielded the water soluble compound O-2142, again did not greatly influence the affinity for CB1receptors.

        "summary": "In this context, urea and amides are related through their chemical structure and functional roles in the modification of compounds affecting CB1 receptor activity. The conversion of an amide group to a urea in a compound resulted in decreased affinity for CB1 receptors, indicating that the presence of an amide or urea group can significantly influence the biological activity of these compounds. This suggests a direct relationship between the two terms in the context of drug design and receptor interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and amides, as the context discusses how the conversion between these two functional groups affects the biological activity of compounds, providing evidence of their relevance in pharmacological studies.",
