[1] Arvanil, a structural \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hybrid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d between the endogenous cannabinoid CB1 receptor ligand anandamide and capsaicin, is a potent agonist for the capsaicin receptor VR1 (vanilloid receptor type 1), inhibits the anandamide membrane transporter (AMT), and induces cannabimimetic responses in mice.  [2] Novel arvanil derivatives prepared by N-methylation, replacement of the amide with urea and thiourea moieties, and manipulation of the vanillyl group were evaluated for their ability to bind/activate CB1 receptors, activate VR1 receptors, inhibit the AMT and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), and produce cannabimimetic effects in mice.  [3] The compounds did not stimulate the CB1 receptor.  [4] Methylation of the amide group decreased the activity at VR1, AMT, and FAAH.  [5] On the aromatic ring, the substitution of the 3-methoxy group with a chlorine atom or the lack of the 4-hydroxy group decreased the activity on VR1 and AMT, but not the affinity for CB1 receptors, and increased the capability to inhibit FAAH.

        "summary": "In this context, urea and amides are related through the discussion of novel arvanil derivatives, where the amide group is replaced with urea and thiourea moieties. This modification is evaluated for its impact on binding and activating cannabinoid receptors and inhibiting related enzymes. The relationship highlights the structural significance of urea in the context of amide functionality in drug design.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and amides, as the context discusses the replacement of the amide group with urea in the synthesis of derivatives, indicating a clear functional relationship in the context of pharmacological activity.",
