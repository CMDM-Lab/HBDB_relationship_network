    "context": "[2] The amines used for O-1988 and O-2094 were prepared by reductive amination procedures  using 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde/CH3NH2\u00c2\u00b7HCl/methanol/NaCNBH4for the former and 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde/ammonium acetate/NaCNBH4/methanol/mol.sieves [3] 3A\u00c2\u00b0 for the latter. [4] O-2093 was synthesized from the appropriate amine, which was formed as a by-product during the reductive amination of 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde described above. [5] The urea analog O-1987 was prepared from arachidonic acid, in a one-pot reaction, via its isocyanate followed by treatment with 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylamine HCl using our published procedure . [6] The thiourea O-2095 was synthesized by treatment of vanillyl isothiocyanate with norarachidonylamine (synthesized from arachidonyl isocyanate  and 2-trimethylsilylethanol/80\u00c2\u00b0C/16 h/followed by deprotection with CF3COOH at 0\u00c2\u00b0C). [7] Similarly, the thiourea O-2109 was prepared using 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzylisothiocyanate (prepared from 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzylamine using the same procedure as described for vanillyl isothiocyanate). [8] O-2142 was synthesized from arvanil and 4-morpholinobutyric acid in methylene chloride/N,N\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide using our procedure . ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and isocyanates are related through a synthetic process where isocyanates are used as intermediates in the preparation of urea analogs. Specifically, the synthesis of the urea analog O-1987 involves the reaction of arachidonic acid with its isocyanate, indicating a direct chemical relationship where isocyanates serve as precursors in urea formation. This highlights the functional role of isocyanates in the synthesis of urea derivatives.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and isocyanates, as the context provides evidence of isocyanates being used as intermediates in the synthesis of urea analogs, demonstrating a clear chemical relationship.",
