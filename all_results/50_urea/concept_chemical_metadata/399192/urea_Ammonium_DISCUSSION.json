    "context": " [5] Export of NH4\n+ would not alkalize the periplasm.  [6] Since NH4\n+ is a cation it would have to be exported against an outside positive membrane potential by an active process such as an ATPase, a proton-ammonium antiport, or a urea-ammonium antiport.  [7] UreI has no signature sequence reminiscent of an ATPase and a proton antiporter would not be able to regulate pH in either the cytoplasm or periplasm.  [8] A urea-ammonium antiporter at normal gastric levels would not facilitate urea entry given an interior negative potential at pH 6.2 of \u00e2\u02c6\u2019101 mV.  [9] Based on these arguments, theureI gene product is either directly responsible for urea permeability and is active at acidic pH or it regulates the urea permeability of another cytoplasmic membrane protein. [10] It is homologous to the amiS genes described as amide transporters . [11] Since urea is an amide, the ureI gene product is possibly a urea transporter. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium (NH4+) are discussed in relation to their transport mechanisms across membranes. The text suggests that ammonium, being a cation, requires active transport processes, potentially involving a urea-ammonium antiporter. This indicates a functional relationship where urea may facilitate the transport of ammonium, highlighting their interconnected roles in cellular processes, particularly in the context of pH regulation and ion transport.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and ammonium, as the context discusses their potential interaction through a urea-ammonium antiporter, indicating a clear functional relationship supported by the mechanisms of transport and regulation.",
