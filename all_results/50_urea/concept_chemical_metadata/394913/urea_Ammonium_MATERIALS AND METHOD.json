[1] Protein concentration was determined by the method of  with the Bio-Rad system using bovine serum albumin as a standard. [2] Ammonium was measured by the phenol-hypochlorite method as described by . [3] Urea was determined either as ammonium after treatment with urease S from Canavalia ensiformisor by the diacetyl monoxime method . [4] Ureidoglycolate and glyoxylate were determined as described by .

        "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium are connected through biochemical measurement methods. Urea can be converted to ammonium through the action of urease, which is mentioned as a method for determining urea concentration. This indicates a direct biochemical relationship where urea metabolism leads to the production of ammonium, highlighting their interdependence in nitrogen metabolism.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and ammonium, as the context describes a method where urea is converted to ammonium, indicating a clear biochemical relationship supported by experimental methodology.",
        "score": 4
