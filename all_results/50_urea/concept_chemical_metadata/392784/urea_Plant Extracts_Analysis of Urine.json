    "context": "[5] Prout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal was to establish a coherent connection between the chemical processes of metabolism and excretion, as manifest in the urine, and the observed changes in the patient\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clinical status. [1] By 1825, when the second edition of his book was published, now renamed An Inquiry Into the Nature and Treatment of Diabetes, Calculus, and Other Affections of The Urinary Organs, most of our present-day knowledge of the composition of urinary stones had been discovered. [2] This book is one of the earliest to contain a list of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tests, Apparatus, &c. [3] required in making Experiments on the Urine\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and this included litmus paper (blue and red), turmeric paper (plant extract exhibits color change from yellow to reddish-brown, and violet on drying, and is a test for alkalinity), a specific gravity bottle or a small portable hydrometer that Prout designed, blowpipe, forceps, two small discs of plate glass for discriminating pus from mucus, and a watch glass for detecting an excess of urea on addition of nitric acid. [4] \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These, with one or two small test tubes, and small stoppered phials, containing solutions of pure ammonia, potash, and nitric acid, can be readily packed into a small portable case, or pocket book, and will be sufficient, by the aid of a common taper or candle, to perform all the experiments on the urine, and urinary productions, that are commonly necessary in a practical point of view\u00e2\u20ac\u009d . [5] Alexander Marcet had described a portable chemical kit in 1817 and showed a line drawing of its components . [6] Barely a year after Prout\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s list of tests and apparatus, Richard Bright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (1789\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1858) studies of renal disease would add a spoon to this portable laboratory, for revealing the presence of albumin in heated urine.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to urine analysis and the historical development of tests for urinary components, while plant extracts are referenced in the context of turmeric paper used for testing alkalinity. However, there is no direct relationship established between urea and plant extracts, as they are discussed in separate contexts of urine testing and chemical analysis without any interaction or functional connection highlighted.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as urea and plant extracts are both mentioned in the context of urine analysis, but their connection is indirect and lacks detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
