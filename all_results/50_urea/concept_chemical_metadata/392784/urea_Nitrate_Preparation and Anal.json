    "context": "[6] Rouelle called it mati\u00c3\u00a8re savonneuse (soapy matter). [7] In England in 1797, William Cruickshank (1745\u00e2\u20ac\u201c1800) added concentrated nitric acid to evaporated urine and obtained crystalline urea nitrate. [1] In 1799 Fourcroy and Vauquelin prepared a nearly pure urea, which they named ur\u00c3\u00a9e . [2] They prepared a much purer urea in 1808 when the sparingly soluble urea nitrate was neutralized by aqueous potassium carbonate. [3] After evaporation to dryness, the residue was extracted with alcohol to separate the urea from the potassium nitrate. [4] Evaporation of the alcoholic solution yielded crystals of urea. [5] Because an aqueous solution of urea decomposes on boiling to carbonic acid, acetic acid, and ammonia, they speculated that ammonia-containing calculi might be formed by the partial fermentation of urea in the bladder.

        "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrate are connected through historical chemical processes involving the preparation of urea nitrate from urine. The text describes the synthesis of urea and its interaction with nitric acid to form urea nitrate, indicating a chemical relationship where nitrate is a product derived from the reaction involving urea. However, the context does not elaborate on their biological significance or interactions beyond this historical perspective.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea and nitrate are discussed in the context of their chemical relationship during historical synthesis processes. While they are related through the formation of urea nitrate, the context lacks detailed exploration of their biological or physiological interactions.",
