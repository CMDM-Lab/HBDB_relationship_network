    "context": "[2] They prepared a much purer urea in 1808 when the sparingly soluble urea nitrate was neutralized by aqueous potassium carbonate. [3] After evaporation to dryness, the residue was extracted with alcohol to separate the urea from the potassium nitrate. [4] Evaporation of the alcoholic solution yielded crystals of urea. [5] Because an aqueous solution of urea decomposes on boiling to carbonic acid, acetic acid, and ammonia, they speculated that ammonia-containing calculi might be formed by the partial fermentation of urea in the bladder. [1] Finally in 1817, a pure urea product was isolated, its properties, appearance, and chemical reactions were described, and its analysis was accurately determined by William Prout (first exhibited, he said, at some lectures he had given 3 years earlier). [2] Prout introduced a purification step with animal charcoal before extraction with boiling alcohol. [3] This became the textbook method of choice for the preparation of urea. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and carbonic acid are related through the decomposition of urea in aqueous solution, which produces carbonic acid, acetic acid, and ammonia upon boiling. This reaction highlights a chemical transformation where urea breaks down into carbonic acid, suggesting a direct relationship in the context of urea's behavior in solution and its potential implications in biological systems, such as the formation of calculi in the bladder.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and carbonic acid, as the context discusses the decomposition of urea into carbonic acid, indicating a clear chemical relationship supported by the description of the reaction.",
