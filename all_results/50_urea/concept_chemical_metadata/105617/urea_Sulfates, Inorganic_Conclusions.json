    "context": "Meanwhile, the PCO reactors were tested for about 6 months, and then there were no deactivation effects of the N-doped TiO2 photocatalyst during this entire period. Similarly, evaluations for longer-term performance of the photocatalyst are recommended for a future study. The current study evaluated the feasibility of applying visible-light-induced TiO2 doped with N element to cleanse air VOCs at a low ppb concentration commonly associated with IAQ issues. The surface chemistry investigation of N-doped TiO2 suggested that there were no significant residual of sulfate ions or urea species on the surface of the N-doped TiO2. It was found that under visible-light irradiation, the photocatalytic technique using N-doped TiO2 was much superior to that for unmodified TiO2 for the degradation of VOCs, and that the photocatalytic destruction efficiency by the N-doped TiO2 was dependent on the SFR, HD, and humidity. Furthermore, within the conditions of the present study, the results clearly demonstrated that the use of visible-light-driven photocatalytic system coated with N-doped TiO2 can effectively cleanse gaseous aromatic hydrocarbons.  [1] An easy, rapid, and reproducible test to distinguish residual cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies from antibodies produced in primary infection could be useful, especially for pregnant women.

        "summary": "In this context, urea and sulfates are mentioned in relation to the surface chemistry of N-doped TiO2 photocatalysts. The study indicates that there were no significant residuals of sulfate ions or urea species on the photocatalyst's surface after testing. This suggests that while both compounds are present in the discussion, their direct relationship or interaction is not explored, indicating a lack of significant relevance between them in this specific context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as urea and sulfates are both mentioned in the context of surface chemistry but without any detailed interaction or functional relationship discussed.",
