    "context": "After incubation of the homogenates with lactose or lactose ureide, galactose-dehydrogenase (in citrate\u2013potassium buffer) was added followed by a further incubation (12 min at room temperature). The extinctions were measured at 365 nm and the amount of galactose was calculated. The protein concentration in all samples was determined by the method of Lowryusing bovine serum albumin as standards. Lactose ureide and maltose ureide were synthesized by acid-catalyzed condensation of lactose/maltose and urea according to the method of Hoffmann [11, 12]. Arabinose ureide was synthesized using the method developed by Helfrich and Kosche. Cellobiose ureide was produced by dissolving 15 g of d-cellobiose and 5.26 g urea in 22 ml boiling water. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and then adjusted to pH 3. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly involved in the synthesis of lactose ureide through an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction with lactose. The process highlights the chemical relationship where urea acts as a reactant in forming lactose ureide, indicating a significant connection between the two compounds in biochemical synthesis. The mention of lactose ureide's synthesis method emphasizes the role of urea in this specific reaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong relevance between urea and lactose ureide, as urea is a key reactant in the synthesis of lactose ureide. The context provides a clear chemical relationship supported by a specific synthesis method, indicating a significant interaction.",
        "score": 4
