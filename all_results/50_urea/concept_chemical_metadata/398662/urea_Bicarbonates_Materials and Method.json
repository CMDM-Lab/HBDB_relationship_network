    "context": "[5] Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl antibody, diluted 1:150 with 1% BSA/PBS-T, washed three times with PBS-T, 10 min each, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG couple to horseradish peroxidase), diluted 1:300 with 1% BSA/PBS-T, and washed. [6] Dots were visualized with a luminol-based enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (LumiGLO, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) and quantified by laser densitometry (Personal Densitometer SI, Molecular Dynamics). [7] Membranes were then stained with amido black (0.1% amido black/45% methanol/10% glacial acetic acid/45% H2O) to confirm equal protein loading. [1] To test whether urea can directly carbonylate cellular proteins in vitro, mIMCD3 cells grown at 300 mosmol/kg were homogenized in 300 mosmol/kg PBS, containing 25 mM bicarbonate, and gassed with 5% CO2, using a pellet pestle (Kimble Glass, Vineland, NJ). [2] Homogenates were left at 300 mosmol/kg or osmolality was increased to 600 mosmol/kg by adding urea, then incubated at 37\u00c2\u00b0C for 15 min. [3] After the resulting suspensions were centrifuged at 20,897 \u00c3\u2014 g for 5 min, SDS was added to 6% final concentration and OxyBlot dot blots were performed, as above. [1] Western analysis used SDS/PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and bicarbonates are mentioned in a biochemical experiment involving mIMCD3 cells. Bicarbonate is used in the homogenization buffer, which is essential for maintaining pH and facilitating reactions involving urea. The relationship suggests that bicarbonate may play a role in the biochemical processes where urea is involved, particularly in protein carbonylation, although the direct interaction between urea and bicarbonates is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea and bicarbonates are both involved in the same experimental setup, indicating a functional relationship in the context of biochemical reactions, but without a detailed exploration of their direct interaction.",
        "score": 3
