    "context": " [7] As a control, an equal volume of ultrapure water was added to the basal medium.  [8] Cyanate forms spontaneously from urea.  [9] To evaluate possible effects of the cyanate, we used a conductivity meter (MultiFunction conductivity meter, Amber Science, Eugene, OR) to measure cyanate in urea solutions, comparing conductivity with that of potassium cyanate (Sigma) standards. [10] Fresh urea solutions, treated with the ion-exchange resin, contain no cyanate. [1] Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). [2] ROS were measured as described in ref. . [3] In brief, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted with phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS to a final concentration of 20 \u00ce\u00bcM in 0.1% DMSO.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to cyanates as cyanate forms spontaneously from urea. The study evaluates the effects of cyanate in urea solutions, indicating a chemical transformation where urea serves as a precursor to cyanate. This relationship is significant as it highlights the potential implications of urea in generating cyanate, which may have further biological or chemical effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and cyanates, as the context explicitly states that cyanate forms from urea, indicating a clear chemical relationship. The evaluation of cyanate in urea solutions further supports this connection.",
        "score": 4
