    "context": " [6] Immediately before an experiment, 20 ml of 10 M urea (Sigma) was mixed with 1.3 g of AG 501-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) at room temperature for 1 h to remove cyanate, then added to the medium to increase the osmolality, as indicated.  [7] As a control, an equal volume of ultrapure water was added to the basal medium.  [8] Cyanate forms spontaneously from urea.  [9] To evaluate possible effects of the cyanate, we used a conductivity meter (MultiFunction conductivity meter, Amber Science, Eugene, OR) to measure cyanate in urea solutions, comparing conductivity with that of potassium cyanate (Sigma) standards. [10] Fresh urea solutions, treated with the ion-exchange resin, contain no cyanate. [1] Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). [2] ROS were measured as described in ref. . ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and Amber are connected through the use of a conductivity meter from Amber Science to measure cyanate levels in urea solutions. The experiment involves mixing urea with a resin to remove cyanate, and the conductivity meter is used to compare the conductivity of treated urea solutions with potassium cyanate standards. This indicates that Amber Science's equipment plays a crucial role in assessing the effects of cyanate derived from urea.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and Amber, as the Amber Science conductivity meter is essential for measuring cyanate levels in urea solutions, demonstrating a clear functional relationship in the experimental setup.",
