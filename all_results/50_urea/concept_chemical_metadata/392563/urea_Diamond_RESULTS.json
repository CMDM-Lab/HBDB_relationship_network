[9] Complete unfolding was obtained by incubation in the presence of 7 m urea and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 100 \u00c2\u00b0C for 30 min (cross-hair, sAPP\u00ce\u00b1695; diamond, sAPP\u00ce\u00b1770). [10] Refolded samples were obtained by removal of urea using a desalting column (open circle, sAPP\u00ce\u00b1695; open triangle, sAPP\u00ce\u00b1770). [1] The equilibrium unfolding of sAPP\u00ce\u00b1695 and sAPP\u00ce\u00b1770 by urea is shown in Fig. 2C. [2] Interestingly, for both proteins unfolding by urea appeared to follow a two-state transition (albeit a highly noncooperative one) between the native and unfolded states, without significantly populated partially unfolded intermediates.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to induce the unfolding of two isoforms of a protein, sAPP\u03b1695 and sAPP\u03b1770, which are represented by different symbols (cross-hair and diamond, respectively). The diamond symbol specifically denotes the unfolding process of sAPP\u03b1770 in the presence of urea, indicating a direct experimental relationship where urea facilitates the unfolding of this protein isoform. However, the context does not elaborate on any further functional significance of this relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is directly involved in the experimental process affecting the protein represented by the diamond symbol. However, the context lacks detailed discussion on the implications of this relationship beyond the experimental setup.",
        "score": 3
