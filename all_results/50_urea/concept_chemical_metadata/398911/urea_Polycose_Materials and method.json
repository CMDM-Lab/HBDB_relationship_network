    "context": "[2] A total of 119 children were recruited (72 boys and 47 girls; mean age 10.4 years, range 3.9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c18.4). [3] No children who had received antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists, or proton pump inhibitors during the three weeks prior to testing were enrolled. [4] The children all provided a faecal sample within seven days of the UBT by mailing a small sample in a clean universal container to the principle investigator. [1] After an overnight fast each child ingested an oral dose of 100 mg13C urea (99 atom % excess, CK Gas, Berks, UK), administered in 20 ml of 15% Polycose (Abbot Labs, Dublin, Eire). [2] Baseline breath samples were collected by asking the child to blow with a straw into a vacutainer, before and at 30 and 45 minutes after ingestion of the labelled urea. [3] 13C enrichment of breath was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry; a rise in13C enrichment of more than 66.0 ppm above fasting baseline (relative to a Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard) was regarded as diagnostic of H pyloriinfection. [1] An enzyme immunoassay (Premier Plantinum HpSA, Meridian Diagnostics Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) was used to detectH pylori in the stool. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and Polycose are connected through a diagnostic procedure involving the ingestion of 13C urea dissolved in a solution containing 15% Polycose. The Polycose serves as a vehicle for delivering the urea to the subjects, facilitating the measurement of 13C enrichment in breath samples to diagnose H. pylori infection. While they are used together in the procedure, their individual roles are distinct, with urea being the analyte of interest and Polycose acting as a carrier.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea and Polycose are used together in a diagnostic context, but their relationship is primarily functional rather than indicating a direct biochemical interaction.",
