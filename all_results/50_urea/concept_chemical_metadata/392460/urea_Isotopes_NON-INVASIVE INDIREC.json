    "context": "This card is then read using a small analyzer with a slot into which the card is put. This type of device might became a genuine 'near patient test', where 14C-urea breath testing is allowed, since it is easy to perform and has the advantage of being cheaper than 13C-urea breath testing. However, concern with 14C usually arises because of its long half-life, and the amount of radiation. Munster et al. reported that approximately 90% of the 14C from a urea breath test is eliminated as CO2 in the breath or urine after 3 days; the amount of isotope retained in the body is negligible. Furthermore, the cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from this test has been calculated to be not more than 0.3 mrem/\u03bcCi, which is considered to be equal to the background radiation that a person is exposed to in 1 day. For this reason, the 1-\u03bcCi 14C dose has been permitted, without restriction, for general use in the USA (Nuclear Radioactive Drug Committee, USA, us10FCR \u00a7 30.21 Radioactive drug), while in Europe the 14C-urea breath test cannot yet be used with children and women of childbearing age.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to isotopes through the use of 14C-urea breath testing, a diagnostic method for assessing gastric function. The discussion highlights the advantages of using 14C over 13C due to cost and ease of use, while also addressing safety concerns related to radiation exposure from the isotope. The relationship is primarily focused on the application of isotopes in medical testing involving urea.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and isotopes, as the context discusses the practical application of 14C-urea in breath testing, supported by evidence regarding safety and effectiveness. This indicates a clear relationship within the medical testing framework.",
