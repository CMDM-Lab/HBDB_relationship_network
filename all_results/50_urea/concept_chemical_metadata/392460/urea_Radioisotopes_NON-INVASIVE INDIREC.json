    "context": "Furthermore, the cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from this test has been calculated to be not more than 0.3 mrem/\u03bcCi, which is considered to be equal to the background radiation that a person is exposed to in 1 day. For this reason, the 1-\u03bcCi 14C dose has been permitted, without restriction, for general use in the USA (Nuclear Radioactive Drug Committee, USA, us10FCR \u00a7 30.21 Radioactive drug), while in Europe the 14C-urea breath test cannot yet be used with children and women of childbearing age. The 13C-urea breath test is identical to the 14C-urea breath test, except that 13C is a non-radioactive isotope of 12C, and its detection requires a mass spectrometer rather than a scintillation counter. Because 13C is a naturally occurring isotope, it is measured as a ratio of 12C, which is the most abundant isotope. The 13C-urea breath test is based on a simple principle: in the presence of H. pylori, isotopically labeled urea is rapidly hydrolyzed by the bacteria's urease, and the released CO2 exhaled in the expired breath. Since its first description by Graham et al., who used 350 mg of 13C-urea, this test has been extensively modified, including variations in the dose of labeled urea, sampling time, test meal, and cut-off values.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is related to radioisotopes through the use of isotopically labeled urea in breath tests for detecting H. pylori infection. The 14C-urea breath test utilizes a radioactive isotope of carbon (14C), while the 13C-urea breath test employs a non-radioactive isotope (13C). Both tests rely on the hydrolysis of urea by H. pylori, leading to the measurement of exhaled CO2. The mention of these tests highlights the application of radioisotopes in medical diagnostics involving urea.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and radioisotopes, as the context discusses the use of isotopically labeled urea in breath tests, providing clear evidence of their relationship in a medical diagnostic setting.",
