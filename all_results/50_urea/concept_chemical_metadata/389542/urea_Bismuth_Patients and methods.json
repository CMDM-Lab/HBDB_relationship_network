    "context": "Pre-treatment H. pylori infection was established by 13C-urea breath test (see later for details of the breath test protocol). Exclusion criteria were (1) age under 18 years; (2) presence of clinically significant associated conditions (hepatic, cardiorespiratory or renal diseases, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, neoplastic diseases, or coagulopathy); and (3) previous gastric surgery.Eradication treatment Three-hundred and twelve (52%) patients were treated with first-line eradication regimen, and 288 (48%) received a rescue regimen (after failure of H. pylori eradication with previous therapy). First-line regimens included a combination of 1-week with proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole 20mg/12h, lansoprazole 30mg/12h, pantoprazole 40mg/12h, rabeprazole 20mg/12h or esomeprazole 40mg/12h) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin 500mg/12h and amoxicillin 1g/12h, or metronidazole 500mg/12h in the case of patients with hypersensitivity to beta-lactamic antibiotics). Rescue regimens included quadruple therapy (that is, proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole), ranitidine bismuth citrate plus tetracycline and metronidazole, levofloxacin-based regimen (plus amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor) or rifabutin-based regimen (plus amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor).Definition of eradication success H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test (see next section for details of the breath test protocol) performed 8 weeks after completion of the eradication treatment. Breath test was carried out by operators unaware of therapy and patient\u2019 H. pylori status. Analysis of H. pylori eradication efficacy was performed on an \u2018intention-to-treat\u2019 basis (this included all patients regardless of compliance with the study protocol; patients with unevaluable data were assumed to have been unsuccessfully treated).13C-urea breath test The commercially available 13C-urea breath test TAU-KIT\u00ae (Isomed, SL, Madrid, Spain) was used.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized in the 13C-urea breath test to establish H. pylori infection status, while bismuth is mentioned as part of the rescue regimens for H. pylori eradication treatment. Although both terms are related to the treatment of H. pylori, their connection is indirect, with urea serving as a diagnostic tool and bismuth as a therapeutic agent. There is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between urea and bismuth in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as urea is used for diagnosis and bismuth for treatment in H. pylori management, but they do not interact or influence each other directly.",
