    "context": " [1] Urea excretion by the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) has been shown in previous studies to be a highly pulsatile facilitated transport, with excretion probably occurring at the gill.  [2] The present study reports the isolation of an 1800 base pair (kb) cDNA from toadfish gill with one open reading frame putatively encoding a 475-residue protein, the toadfish urea transporter (tUT).  [3] tUT, the first teleostean urea transporter cloned, has high homology with UTs (facilitated urea transporters) cloned from mammals, an amphibian and a shark, and most closely resembles the UT-A subfamily.  [4] When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, tUT increased urea permeability (as measured by [(14)C]urea uptake) five- to sevenfold, and this permeability increase was abolished by phloretin, a common inhibitor of other UTs.  [5] Northern analysis using the 1.8 kb clone was performed to determine the tissue distribution and dynamics of tUT mRNA expression.  [6] Of six tissues examined (gill, liver, red blood cells, kidney, skin and intestine), only gill showed expression of tUT mRNA, with a predominant band at 1.8 kb and a minor band at 3.5 kb.  [7] During several points in the urea pulse cycle of toadfish (0, 4, 6, 12 and 18 h post-pulse), measured by excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water, gill mRNA samples were obtained. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which facilitates urea excretion at the gill. Phloretin is mentioned as an inhibitor of tUT, demonstrating its role in blocking urea permeability when tUT is expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This indicates a direct functional relationship where Phloretin affects the transport of urea by inhibiting the transporter.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and Phloretin, as the context provides evidence of Phloretin's inhibitory effect on the urea transporter, indicating a clear functional relationship in the transport process.",
        "score": 4
