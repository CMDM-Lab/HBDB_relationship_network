    "context": " [7] Briefly, H3K36C-C110A was generated by quick change PCR on a plasmid encoding histone H3 C110A.  [8] H3K36C-C110A was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS at 37 \u00c2\u00b0C for 4 h (induction at A600 = 0.6 with 0.2 mm isopropyl \u00ce\u00b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside).  [9] Histone-containing inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. [10] After exchanging guanidine hydrochloride for 7 m urea by dialysis, the histones were further purified by sequential anion and cation exchange column chromatography. [11] The histone solutions were loaded onto a 5-ml Q and a SP Sepharose column assembled inline. [12] The Q Sepharose column was then removed, and the protein was eluted from the SP Sepharose column using a linear gradient of NaCl from 100 to 500 mm in the urea buffer (7 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). [13] Histone-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against water supplemented with 5 mm \u00ce\u00b2-mercaptoethanol, and lyophilized. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a component in the purification process of histones through dialysis and chromatography. Anions, specifically in the form of sodium chloride (NaCl), are involved in the elution process during anion exchange chromatography. While urea serves as a denaturing agent to solubilize proteins, anions like NaCl are crucial for separating proteins based on their charge. The relationship is functional, as both are integral to the purification protocol, but they do not interact directly.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea and anions are both essential in the protein purification process, with urea aiding in solubilization and anions facilitating separation. However, their relationship is more about their roles in the procedure rather than a direct interaction.",
