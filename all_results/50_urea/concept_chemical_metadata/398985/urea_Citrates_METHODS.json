[14] The color reaction starts during the 10-minute incubation with urea peroxide and 3,3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2,5,5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate in 100-mM citrate\u00e2\u20ac\u201cacetate-buffered solution (pH 5.0). [15] The reaction is stopped by adding 2 N sulfuric acid (pH \u00e2\u2030\u00a4 1.0). [16] The yellow color intensity was spectrophotometrically read at a wavelength of 450 nm.

        "summary": "In this context, urea and citrates are mentioned in relation to a color reaction involving urea peroxide and a citrate-acetate buffer. The citrate buffer is used to maintain the pH during the reaction, which is essential for the proper functioning of the assay. However, there is no direct interaction or significant biological relationship discussed between urea and citrates beyond their roles in the experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as urea and citrates are connected through their roles in a specific experimental procedure, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond this context.",
