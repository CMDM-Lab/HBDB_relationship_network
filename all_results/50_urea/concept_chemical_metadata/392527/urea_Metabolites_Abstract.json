    "context": "[1] Summary: We present brain MR images in three patients with neonatal-onset hyperammonemic encephalopathy resulting from urea-cycle disorders (two sisters with deficiency of the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I reaction step and one boy with an ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency). [2] MR imaging revealed almost identical findings of injury to the bilateral lentiform nuclei and the deep sulci of the insular and perirolandic regions; to our knowledge, this pattern has not been previously reported. [3] We hypothesize that these lesions presumably reflect the distribution of brain injury due to hypoperfusion secondary to hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia in the neonatal period. [1] The urea cycle incorporates excess nitrogen into urea, a water-soluble waste product, preventing the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous metabolites in the body. [2] Five well-documented urea cycle disorders have been described, each representing a defect in the catalytic efficacy of one of the enzymes of the cycle . [3] Although brain MR imaging findings in late-onset types have been described (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c), few reports describe the neuroimaging results in neonatal-onset cases . [4] We herein describe the clinical presentation and brain MR imaging findings in three patients with neonatal-onset urea-cycle disorders. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to metabolites as it is a product of the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen in the body to prevent the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous metabolites. Urea serves as a water-soluble waste product, indicating its role in metabolite management, particularly in conditions like urea-cycle disorders that lead to hyperammonemia and the buildup of harmful metabolites. The study highlights the importance of urea in mitigating the effects of toxic metabolites in the brain, particularly in neonatal-onset hyperammonemic encephalopathy.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between urea and metabolites, as urea is a direct product of the urea cycle that prevents the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous metabolites. The context emphasizes the critical role of urea in metabolic processes, particularly in the context of urea-cycle disorders.",
