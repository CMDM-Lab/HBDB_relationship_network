    "context": "[1] Summary: We present brain MR images in three patients with neonatal-onset hyperammonemic encephalopathy resulting from urea-cycle disorders (two sisters with deficiency of the carbamyl phosphate synthetase I reaction step and one boy with an ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency). [2] MR imaging revealed almost identical findings of injury to the bilateral lentiform nuclei and the deep sulci of the insular and perirolandic regions; to our knowledge, this pattern has not been previously reported. [3] We hypothesize that these lesions presumably reflect the distribution of brain injury due to hypoperfusion secondary to hyperammonemia and hyperglutaminemia in the neonatal period. [1] The urea cycle incorporates excess nitrogen into urea, a water-soluble waste product, preventing the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous metabolites in the body. [2] Five well-documented urea cycle disorders have been described, each representing a defect in the catalytic efficacy of one of the enzymes of the cycle . [3] Although brain MR imaging findings in late-onset types have been described (\u00e2\u20ac\u201c), few reports describe the neuroimaging results in neonatal-onset cases . [4] We herein describe the clinical presentation and brain MR imaging findings in three patients with neonatal-onset urea-cycle disorders. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are closely related through the urea cycle, which is a metabolic pathway that converts excess nitrogen into urea, a non-toxic waste product. This process is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous compounds in the body, particularly in patients with urea-cycle disorders. The urea cycle's function highlights the importance of nitrogen metabolism in maintaining physiological balance and preventing hyperammonemia.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between urea and nitrogen, as the urea cycle specifically incorporates excess nitrogen to produce urea, emphasizing their interdependence in metabolic processes.",
        "score": 5
