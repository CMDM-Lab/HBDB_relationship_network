    "context": "It was found that under visible-light irradiation, the photocatalytic technique using N-doped TiO2 was much superior to that for unmodified TiO2 for the degradation of VOCs, and that the photocatalytic destruction efficiency by the N-doped TiO2 was dependent on the SFR, HD, and humidity. Furthermore, within the conditions of the present study, the results clearly demonstrated that the use of visible-light-driven photocatalytic system coated with N-doped TiO2 can effectively cleanse gaseous aromatic hydrocarbons.  [1] An easy, rapid, and reproducible test to distinguish residual cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies from antibodies produced in primary infection could be useful, especially for pregnant women.  [2] The CMV avidity of IgG antibodies with the VIDAS automated enzyme-linked fluorescent assay and 6 M urea was evaluated in a multicenter study to differentiate between primary CMV infections and past infections or reactivations.  [3] A total of 416 serum specimens were tested: 159 specimens were from follow-up of primary infections, and 257 were from past infections.  [4] All of the specimens from primary infections collected within 4 months (17 weeks) after the onset of the infection had an avidity index lower than 0.8.  [5] An avidity index higher than 0.8 excludes a recent primary infection of less than 4 months. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to a study evaluating the avidity of IgG antibodies for cytomegalovirus (CMV) using a test that incorporates 6 M urea. This test aims to differentiate between primary CMV infections and past infections or reactivations. However, the relationship between urea and primary infection NOS is not explicitly detailed beyond its role in the assay, indicating a limited connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as urea is part of a testing method for distinguishing primary infections but lacks a direct relationship with primary infection NOS itself. The mention is more about its use in the context of CMV rather than a significant biological interaction.",
