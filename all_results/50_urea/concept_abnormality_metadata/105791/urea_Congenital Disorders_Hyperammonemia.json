    "context": "Further, it has been recently shown that the performance of psychological tasks is not affected by induced hyperammonemia (up to 225 \u03bcmol/L) in a double blind cross-over study with healthy volunteers. As previously outlined, severe liver disease and development of portosystemic shunts usually result in hyperammonemia due to defective hepatic ammonium clearance or diversion of the portal blood with high ammonium content into the systemic circulation.Urea cycle disorders Congenital or acquired deficiency of any of the enzymes involved in the urea cycle reactions (N-acetylglutamate synthase, carbamoylphosphate synthetase-1, ornithine transcarbamylase, argininosuccinate synthetase-1, argininosuccinate lyase, arginase-1, mitochondrial ornithine transporter, and citrin) may produce hyperammonemia. Congenital deficiency of the mitochondrial isoenzyme of carbonic anhydrase has not been reported as cause of hyperammonemia. Congenital urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inherited as autosomal recessive traits, except ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is X-linked. The most frequent congenital UCD in Japan, US, and Finland is ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency while the least frequent is arginase-1 deficiency. The overall frequency of congenital UCDs is estimated to vary from 1 in 30,000 live births to 1 in 50,000 live births. Patients with UCDs characteristically exhibit an encephalopathy commencing with hyperventilation and early respiratory alkalosis followed by coma and hyperammonemia. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to congenital disorders through the discussion of congenital urea cycle disorders (UCDs), which are inherited conditions affecting the enzymes responsible for urea production. Deficiencies in these enzymes lead to hyperammonemia, a critical condition associated with UCDs. The text highlights the genetic basis of these disorders and their clinical implications, indicating a significant relationship between urea metabolism and congenital disorders.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as congenital urea cycle disorders are specifically defined by their impact on urea metabolism, with clear clinical consequences linked to enzyme deficiencies. The context provides detailed information on the genetic inheritance and frequency of these disorders, underscoring their critical relationship with urea.",
