    "context": " [9] These results further confirm the gill localization of urea transport in the toadfish and suggest that tUT regulation (and the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion) is probably not at the level of mRNA control. [10] The results are discussed in the context of the mechanisms of vasopressin-regulated UT-A in mammalian kidney and morphological data for the toadfish gill. [1] Objective. [2] The noninvasive13C-urea breath test (UBT) is a reliable diagnostic method for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in children, and it avoids invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy. [3] In this study, we compared a noninvasive, newly developed fecal H pylori antigen test with the UBT. [1] Methodology. [2] One hundred sixty-two children (76 girls and 86 boys) were tested for H pylori infection using the UBT and a new antigen test in stool samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the noninvasive 13C-urea breath test (UBT), which is utilized for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in children. The UBT leverages the metabolism of urea by H. pylori, making it a valuable diagnostic tool. The study compares this method with a new fecal antigen test, highlighting the relevance of urea in diagnosing H. pylori infections.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as urea is directly involved in the diagnostic process for Helicobacter infections through the UBT, indicating a critical relationship between the two terms.",
