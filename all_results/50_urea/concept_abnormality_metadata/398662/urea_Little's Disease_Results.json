    "context": " [2] Carbonylation is very rapid.  [3] Extensive protein carbonylation is already evident within 5 min after 300 mM urea is added (Fig. 2B ).  [4] Further, very little urea is required.  [5] As little as 5 mM urea significantly carbonylates proteins in mIMCD3 cells within 15 min (Fig. 2C ).  [6] The amount of carbonylation apparently peaks at 20 mM.  [7] However, oxidation may be even greater at higher urea concentration.  [8] Carbonylation at higher urea concentrations may decrease because the carbonyl groups are susceptible to further oxidation to carboxylic acids. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in protein carbonylation, which occurs rapidly upon its addition to cells. However, there is no mention of Little's Disease or any direct connection between urea and this condition. The focus is solely on the biochemical effects of urea on protein modification, lacking any relevance to Little's Disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between urea and Little's Disease, as the context only discusses urea's biochemical effects without any reference to the disease or its implications.",
