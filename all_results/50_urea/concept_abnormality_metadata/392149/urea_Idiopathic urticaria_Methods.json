    "context": "Bibliographies were also searched for relevant studies. Included studies met the following criteria: (1) patients had to experience urticaria for at least 6 weeks; (2) other known causes of urticaria were excluded by testing (eg, history, physical examination, complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies, urinalysis, antinuclear antibody, protein electrophoresis, examination of stool for ova and parasites, antibodies to hepatitis B and hepatitis C, testing for physical urticaria, and serologic assessment for infection with Streptococcus, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus); (3) the initial diagnosis of H pylori infection was made by either serology, urea breath test, or by upper endoscopy; and (4) an acceptable trial of an antibiotic with known activity against H pylori was completed. Studies done in hospitalized inpatients, or in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms only, were excluded to enhance the validity of our findings. We only included studies in which there was an appropriate group for comparison; the effect of H pylori eradication with antibiotic treatment had to be compared with unsuccessful eradication with antibiotics, placebo therapy, or the spontaneous remission of patients with idiopathic chronic urticaria who were H pylori-negative. Urea breath testing and upper endoscopy results were used to determine whether eradication with antibiotic therapy was successful. If the information was not contained in the published report, personal communication was made with study authors to determine whether eradication therapy was successful. If follow-up evaluations were done on more than 1 occasion, the success rate at the last date of follow-up was used. In 1 published study,8 a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design was used to evaluate the effect of treatment on 11 patients with H pylori infection. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the diagnostic processes for idiopathic urticaria, particularly in the context of H. pylori infection assessment. Urea breath tests are utilized to determine the presence of H. pylori, which may be linked to chronic urticaria in some patients. However, the direct relationship between urea and idiopathic urticaria is not explicitly established, as the focus is more on the diagnostic criteria and exclusion of other causes rather than a direct interaction or effect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as urea is involved in the diagnostic process for H. pylori, which may relate to idiopathic urticaria. However, there is no detailed discussion of a direct relationship between urea and the condition itself.",
