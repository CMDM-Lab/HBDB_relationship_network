[1] The 13C-urea breath test is currently regarded as the best non-invasive diagnostic method for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection, even when monitoring efficacy of treatment.\u00e2\u20ac\u201c [2] Serological methods are not appropriate for such monitoring as antibodies stay for months after successful eradication. [3] A newly developed immunoassay that detects bacterial antigens in a faeces specimen might constitute a non-invasive technique for evaluating the efficacy of eradication regimens shortly after treatment is stopped. [1] In this prospective study we compared a new antigen test for H pylori in faeces with the reference method of monitoring treatment, the 13C-urea breath test. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to Helicobacter infections through the 13C-urea breath test, which is a non-invasive diagnostic method for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection. This test measures the presence of urea in the breath, indicating the activity of the bacteria. The effectiveness of this method is highlighted as superior to serological methods for monitoring treatment efficacy.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between urea and Helicobacter infections, as the 13C-urea breath test is specifically designed to diagnose and monitor these infections, demonstrating a critical connection in clinical practice.",
