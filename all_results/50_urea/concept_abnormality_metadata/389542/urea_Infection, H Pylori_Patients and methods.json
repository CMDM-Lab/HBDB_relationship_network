    "context": "At present, 1-week triple therapy combining a proton pump inhibitor with two antibiotics constitutes the standard care for H. pylori infection treatment, and rescue regimens are frequently prescribed for those failing the first eradication trial. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether pre-treatment 13C-urea breath test value may be a predictor of response to H. pylori when either a first-line 1-week proton pump inhibitor-based triple regimen or a rescue regimen are prescribed as eradication therapy, and to evaluate whether a cut-off point for \u03b4 13CO2 value can predict success/failure with these treatments. Patients Six-hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with peptic ulcer or functional dyspepsia and infected by H. pylori were prospectively included. Pre-treatment H. pylori infection was established by 13C-urea breath test (see later for details of the breath test protocol). Exclusion criteria were (1) age under 18 years; (2) presence of clinically significant associated conditions (hepatic, cardiorespiratory or renal diseases, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, neoplastic diseases, or coagulopathy); and (3) previous gastric surgery.Eradication treatment Three-hundred and twelve (52%) patients were treated with first-line eradication regimen, and 288 (48%) received a rescue regimen (after failure of H. pylori eradication with previous therapy). First-line regimens included a combination of 1-week with proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole 20mg/12h, lansoprazole 30mg/12h, pantoprazole 40mg/12h, rabeprazole 20mg/12h or esomeprazole 40mg/12h) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin 500mg/12h and amoxicillin 1g/12h, or metronidazole 500mg/12h in the case of patients with hypersensitivity to beta-lactamic antibiotics). Rescue regimens included quadruple therapy (that is, proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole), ranitidine bismuth citrate plus tetracycline and metronidazole, levofloxacin-based regimen (plus amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor) or rifabutin-based regimen (plus amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor).Definition of eradication success H. pylori eradication was defined as a negative 13C-urea breath test (see next section for details of the breath test protocol) performed 8 weeks after completion of the eradication treatment.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to H. pylori infection through the use of the 13C-urea breath test, which serves as a diagnostic tool to establish H. pylori infection status in patients. The test measures the presence of urease activity from H. pylori, indicating infection. A negative result post-treatment signifies successful eradication of the bacteria, highlighting the role of urea in monitoring treatment efficacy.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and H. pylori infection, as the 13C-urea breath test is a critical diagnostic method for detecting the infection and assessing treatment success, supported by clinical data.",
        "score": 4
