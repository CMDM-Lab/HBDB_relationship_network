    "context": "In contrast, the urea breath test is be preferred in cirrhotics with severe clotting impairment to avoid the risk of bleeding following biopsy sampling (Fig. 1 ). In conclusion, the accuracy of the urea breath test for H. pylori diagnosis is very high in cirrhotics, whilst serology and the rapid urease test both give disappointing results. Conflict of interest statement None declared. The 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) is a noninvasive, simple and accurate test used to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection [1\u20135]. However, Graham et al. in 1987 observed a late rise of 13C enrichment in H. pylori negative patients 120 min after administration of 13C-urea and they thought it to be of colonic origin. Some investigators are worried that this can cause a false positive result, especially in the case of a rapid intestinal transit, such as patients who have had previous gastric surgery. We performed a colonic 13C-UBT by introducing labeled urea to the caecum during colonoscopic examination and found that ten of twelve tested patients had a positive result. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to Helicobacter infections through the urea breath test (UBT), which is a noninvasive method used to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection. The test's accuracy is highlighted, particularly in cirrhotic patients, where it outperforms other diagnostic methods. The presence of urea in the test is crucial for detecting H. pylori, as the bacteria metabolize urea, leading to detectable changes in breath samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between urea and Helicobacter infections, as the urea breath test is specifically designed to diagnose H. pylori, demonstrating a critical connection supported by clinical evidence.",
        "score": 5
