    "context": " [5] Generally speaking, urea appearance rates in the mucosal saline were higher in fed tissues compared with the respective fasted tissues.  [6] Specifically, mucosal urea appearance rates were 1.5-fold higher in fed tissues exposed to control mucosal saline (70.8\u00c2\u00b19.9 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192), rates similar to fed tissues exposed to high ammonia saline (58.5\u00c2\u00b17.2 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192; Fig. 2C).  [7] As seen with fasted tissue, exposure to a high glutamine mucosal saline reduced urea mucosal appearance rates threefold to 23.5\u00c2\u00b17.0 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192, and exposure to a high ammonia and high glutamine mucosal saline recovered urea appearance rates to control saline values (Fig. 2C).  [8] The appearance rate of urea in the mucosal saline was higher in fasted\n\nfish exposed to antibiotics compared with fasted fish and similar to concentrations found in fed fish with each respective mucosal treatment.  [9] Once again, exposure to high glutamine significantly reduced the appearance rate of urea in the mucosal solution; however, values remained above those seen in both fasted and fed fish (38.9\u00c2\u00b14.9 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192; Fig. 2C). [10] Treatment with high ammonia and high glutamine partially recovered the appearance rate of urea in the lumen (49.4\u00c2\u00b14.1 nmol N h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 cm\u00e2\u02c6\u20192), but not back to control saline values as seen without antibiotic treatment (Fig. 2C). [11] The serosal appearance rate of urea was influenced only by condition, and not mucosal saline treatment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its appearance rates in mucosal saline under different feeding conditions and treatments, while the FASTK gene is not explicitly mentioned or linked to the urea metabolism or its rates. The context focuses on physiological responses rather than any genetic influence or relationship with the FASTK gene, indicating a lack of direct connection between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as urea is discussed in terms of its physiological appearance rates, but there is no mention or implication of the FASTK gene's role or relevance in this context.",
