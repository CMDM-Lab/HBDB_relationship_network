    "context": "Postprandial hyperammonemia produces episodes of lethargy, convulsions, or coma. Sometimes there is a variety of other symptoms, including aversion to protein-rich foods, hepatosplenomegaly, lens opacities, hyperextensible joints, hyperelastic skin, osteoporosis, short stature, hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, neurological involvement, mental retardation, focal glomerulosclerosis, renal tubular disease, interstitial lung disease and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Recurring postprandial hyperammonemia is assumed to be due to a depletion of ornithine and arginine in liver mitochondria. Citrulline administration, which is metabolized sequentially to arginine and then ornithine, results in improved urea cycle performance and amelioration of the postprandial rise of plasma ammonium.Carnitine deficiency Carnitine is a molecule normally derived from dietary protein although it may be synthesized by the liver from lysine and methionine as a methyl donor. It is required for the transfer of medium- and long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane to be oxidized. Carnitine enters the cell across a plasma membrane carnitine transporter, OCTN2, being conjugated with fatty acids on the outer mitochondrial membrane by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT1). The acylcarnitine complex is transferred across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the enzyme carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT). ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to dietary proteins through the metabolic processes that occur after protein consumption. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, which can lead to the production of ammonia. This ammonia is then converted into urea in the liver, a key step in the urea cycle. The mention of postprandial hyperammonemia suggests that disturbances in this cycle can occur due to protein intake, highlighting the importance of dietary proteins in urea synthesis and metabolism.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and dietary proteins, as the context discusses how protein metabolism leads to urea production. The relationship is supported by the mention of the urea cycle and its implications for health, particularly in the context of hyperammonemia.",
