    "context": " [3] Both high NaCl and high raffinose cause protein carbonylation (Fig. 2D ).  [4] NaCl and raffinose have little in common except that a high concentration of each is hypertonic, making it likely that their effect is due to the hypertonicity, rather than a specific effect of either.  [5] On the other hand, high urea is not hypertonic because urea readily permeates cells.  [6] However, urea affects protein structure and activity , which could cause oxidative stress if the affected proteins were involved in oxidative reactions.  [7] Because high sorbitol and glycerol do not cause carbonylation (Fig. 2D ), high osmolality is not of itself the cause the oxidative stress.  [8] The lack of effect of sorbitol (Fig. 2D ) is puzzling.  [9] High sorbitol is hypertonic, like raffinose, but its effect evidently differs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its impact on protein structure and activity. Unlike hypertonic substances like NaCl and raffinose, urea permeates cells and alters protein conformation, potentially leading to oxidative stress if these proteins are involved in oxidative reactions. This indicates a significant relationship between urea and protein structure, highlighting urea's role in modifying protein behavior under certain conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and protein structure, as the context explicitly states that urea affects protein structure and activity, suggesting a clear and significant relationship supported by the discussion of potential oxidative stress.",
        "score": 4
