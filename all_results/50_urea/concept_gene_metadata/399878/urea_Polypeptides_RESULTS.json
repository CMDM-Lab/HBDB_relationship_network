    "context": "[4] Peripheral V1 57- and 67-kD subunits were also completely dissociated from the membrane under these conditions (C. [5] Magembe, unpublished observations). [6] Thus, the 44-kD polypeptide behaved like a peripherally attached subunit in membrane fractionation experiments with a strong chaotrope. [1] Dissociation of 44-kD polypeptide from tonoplast membranes by urea treatment. [2] Tonoplast membranes equivalent to 50 \u00ce\u00bcg of protein were incubated in buffer alone (top) or buffer containing 8m urea (bottom) for 30 min on ice. [3] Membranes were collected by centrifugation and protein samples from both membrane pellet and supernatant fractions were prepared as described in Methods. [4] Proteins were separated on 12% gels and immunoblotted with \u00ce\u00b1-Vma6p antiserum. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used to dissociate a 44-kD polypeptide from tonoplast membranes during membrane fractionation experiments. The treatment with 8M urea facilitates the separation of the polypeptide from the membrane, indicating that urea plays a critical role in altering the interactions between polypeptides and membrane structures. This suggests a significant biochemical relationship where urea acts as a chaotropic agent affecting polypeptide behavior.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and polypeptides, as the context provides evidence of urea's role in dissociating polypeptides from membranes, indicating a clear biochemical interaction.",
