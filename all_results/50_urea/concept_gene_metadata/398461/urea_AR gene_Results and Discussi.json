[3] Consistent with the linear relations in Eqs.\u00c2\u00a01 and 2, apoSOD1C57\u00e2\u20ac\u201cC146, apoSOD1SH\u00c2\u00a0SH and apoSOD1\u00ce\u201dIV\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u201dVII yield all characteristically V-shaped chevron plots under the conditions of the fibrillation assays at 37\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C (Fig.\u00c2\u00a02 and Table\u00c2\u00a01). [4] We investigate here how these linear changes of log\u00c2\u00a0KD-N correlate with changes of the fibrillation kinetics; i.e., we vary the occupancy of putative fibrillation-prone material by urea titration (Fig.\u00c2\u00a02 and Table\u00c2\u00a01). [5] A benefit of this approach is that it allows larger variation of protein concentration than conventional aggregation assays. [6] With a fixed concentration of 25\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM apoSOD1\u00ce\u201dIV\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u201dVII, which is the most stable construct in this study, urea titration permits screening of [N]\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a025\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM to 100\u00c2\u00a0pM and [D]\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a035\u00c2\u00a0nM to 25\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bcM.

However, there is no direct mention or connection to the AR gene, which typically relates to androgen receptor functions in cellular processes. The relationship between urea and the AR gene is not established or explored in the provided text.",
