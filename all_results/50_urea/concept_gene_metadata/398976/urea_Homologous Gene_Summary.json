    "context": "[5] Therefore, in addition to its possible role as a diagnostic tool, the detection of stool antigens raises the possibility of genotyping the organism and thereby studying its transmission and epidemiology.  [1] Urea excretion by the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) has been shown in previous studies to be a highly pulsatile facilitated transport, with excretion probably occurring at the gill.  [2] The present study reports the isolation of an 1800 base pair (kb) cDNA from toadfish gill with one open reading frame putatively encoding a 475-residue protein, the toadfish urea transporter (tUT).  [3] tUT, the first teleostean urea transporter cloned, has high homology with UTs (facilitated urea transporters) cloned from mammals, an amphibian and a shark, and most closely resembles the UT-A subfamily.  [4] When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, tUT increased urea permeability (as measured by [(14)C]urea uptake) five- to sevenfold, and this permeability increase was abolished by phloretin, a common inhibitor of other UTs.  [5] Northern analysis using the 1.8 kb clone was performed to determine the tissue distribution and dynamics of tUT mRNA expression.  [6] Of six tissues examined (gill, liver, red blood cells, kidney, skin and intestine), only gill showed expression of tUT mRNA, with a predominant band at 1.8 kb and a minor band at 3.5 kb. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is related to the homologous gene through the study of the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which is a protein that facilitates urea transport. The tUT gene exhibits high homology with urea transporters from various species, indicating a conserved evolutionary function. This suggests that the gene encoding tUT plays a critical role in urea excretion in the toadfish, linking the biochemical process of urea transport to genetic expression.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and the homologous gene, as the context discusses the cloning of the tUT gene and its functional role in urea transport, supported by comparative analysis with other species. This indicates a clear relationship within the biochemical and genetic framework.",
