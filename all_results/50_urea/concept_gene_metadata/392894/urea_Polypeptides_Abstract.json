    "context": " [2] To study this issue, lactose permease, a membrane transport protein fromEscherichia coli, is transcribed, translated, and inserted into inside-out membrane vesicles in vitro.  [3] The protein is in a native conformation as judged by sensitivity to protease, binding of a monoclonal antibody directed against a conformational epitope, and importantly, by functional assays.  [4] By exploiting this system it is possible to express the N-terminal six helices of the permease (N6) and probe changes in conformation during insertion into the membrane.  [5] Specifically, when N6 remains attached to the ribosome it is readily extracted from the membrane with urea, whereas after release from the ribosome or translation of additional helices, those polypeptides are not urea extractable.  [6] Furthermore, the accessibility of an engineered Factor Xa site to Xa protease is reduced significantly when N6 is released from the ribosome or more helices are translated.  [7] Finally, spontaneous disulfide formation between Cys residues at positions 126 (Helix IV) and 144 (Helix V) is observed when N6 is released from the ribosome and inserted into the membrane.  [8] Moreover, in contrast to full-length permease, N6 is degraded by FtsH protease in vivo, and N6 with a single Cys residue at position 148 does not react with N-ethylmaleimide. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a reagent to extract polypeptides from the membrane during the study of lactose permease insertion. Specifically, the N-terminal six helices of the permease (N6) can be extracted with urea when still attached to the ribosome, indicating a relationship where urea facilitates the analysis of polypeptide conformation and membrane interaction. However, once N6 is released from the ribosome or additional helices are translated, it becomes resistant to urea extraction, highlighting a significant change in the polypeptide's structural state.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and polypeptides, as urea is directly involved in the extraction process of polypeptides from the membrane, demonstrating a clear functional relationship supported by experimental observations.",
