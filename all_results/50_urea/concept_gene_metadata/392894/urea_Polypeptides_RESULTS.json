    "context": "[3] However when N6containing a stop codon is synthesized in vitro in the presence of ISO vesicles, the polypeptide is not extracted by urea (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and2). [4] Surprisingly, N6 truncated at position 226 and lacking a stop codon so that ribosomes remain attached is partially extracted from the membrane by urea (lane 3), and urea extraction is increased in the presence of 150 mm KCl (data not shown). [5] The data suggest that the translation intermediate, N6 with an attached ribosome, is located in a relatively hydrophilic environment. [6] Interestingly, the quantity of urea-soluble product is decreased by the addition of puromycin, which causes release of the polypeptide from the ribosome before urea extraction (lane 4). [7] LacY truncated at position 312 and lacking a stop codon which contains 9 transmembrane helices followed by a bound ribosome is no longer susceptible to urea extraction even before treatment with puromycin (lanes 5 and 6). [8] Thus, ribosome binding to LacY per se does not appear to affect susceptibility to urea extraction. [9] The data are consistent with the interpretation that the N-terminal half of LacY does not fully insert into the lipid bilayer before ribosome release or subsequent synthesis and insertion of two of the C-terminal six helices.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its ability to extract polypeptides from membranes during in vitro synthesis. The study indicates that certain polypeptides, particularly those associated with ribosomes, exhibit varying susceptibility to urea extraction, suggesting a relationship between urea's solubilizing properties and the structural state of polypeptides in a hydrophilic environment. The presence of urea influences the extraction of polypeptides, highlighting its role in protein solubility and membrane interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and polypeptides, as the context provides evidence of urea's role in extracting polypeptides from membranes, indicating a clear functional relationship supported by experimental data.",
