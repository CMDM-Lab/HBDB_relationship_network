    "context": "[2] Furthermore, little information is available regarding whether folding into a tertiary conformation begins in the translocon or only after migration into the bilayer with the assistance of chaperones such as PE . [3] The observation that the first six helices of LacY are extracted with urea when the ribosome remains attached, whereas the first eight helices are not, suggests that the translocon can accommodate at least six transmembrane helices, a conclusion similar to that drawn from findings obtained with P-glycoprotein . [4] Similarly, an in vitro study of the polytopic membrane protein MtlA suggests more than one pair of transmembrane domains are assembled before the exit from translocon . [5] On the other hand, the N6 portion of LacY may not be fully accommodated by the translocon, and part of N6 may be in contact with lipid, which would explain why the polypeptide is not completely extracted with urea (Fig. 3). [1] Photo cross-linking studies on certain membrane proteins indicate that the transmembrane domains may indeed interact with lipid during insertion . [2] With LacY, the first or second transmembrane helix might interact with phospholipid, whereas helices III to VI are still in the translocon. [3] However, if this is the case, it is unlikely that the first two helices migrate very far from the translocon. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the extraction of transmembrane helices from the ribosome during protein synthesis, specifically regarding polypeptides like LacY. The study indicates that certain helices can be extracted with urea, suggesting a role of urea in the folding or stabilization of polypeptides during their translocation through the translocon. This highlights a functional relationship where urea influences the behavior of polypeptides in a membrane protein context.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and polypeptides, as the context discusses how urea affects the extraction and folding of polypeptides during their synthesis and insertion into membranes, supported by experimental observations.",
