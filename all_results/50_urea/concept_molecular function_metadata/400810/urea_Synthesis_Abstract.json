    "context": " [8] The activities of argininosuccinate synthase and arginase were increased by 4-fold and 50-100-fold, respectively, in enterocytes from post-weaning pigs compared with suckling pigs.  [9] The induction of arginase appears to be sufficient to account for the formation of urea from ammonia, glutamine and arginine in post-weaning pig enterocytes. [10] These results demonstrate for the first time the presence of synthesis of urea from extracellular or intramitochondrially generated ammonia in enterocytes of post-weaning pigs. [11] This hitherto unrecognized urea synthesis in these cells may be a first line of defence against the potential toxicity of ammonia produced by the extensive intestinal degradation of glutamine (a major fuel for enterocytes) and derived from diet and luminal micro-organisms.  [1] The peptidoleukotrienes and leukotriene B4, formed from arachidonic acid through the action of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), exert a spectrum of biological effects.  [2] It has been proposed that potent and selective 5-LO inhibitors will be effective therapy in diseases in which the peptidoleukotrienes and leukotriene B4 have been implicated, such as asthma and arthritis.  [3] The novel compound (S)-N-hydroxy-N-(2,3-dihydro-6-phenylmethoxy-3-benzyofuranyl )urea (SB 202235) was evaluated as a selective inhibitor of 5-LO in a cell-free system as well as in various cellular assays.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is synthesized from ammonia, glutamine, and arginine in the enterocytes of post-weaning pigs, as indicated by the increased activities of argininosuccinate synthase and arginase. This synthesis process is crucial for detoxifying ammonia, which can be toxic at high levels, thus highlighting the significance of urea synthesis in maintaining cellular health and function in these pigs.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly discusses the synthesis of urea from specific substrates in enterocytes, emphasizing its role in detoxifying ammonia and its importance in post-weaning pigs' physiology.",
