    "context": "[2] They prepared a much purer urea in 1808 when the sparingly soluble urea nitrate was neutralized by aqueous potassium carbonate. [3] After evaporation to dryness, the residue was extracted with alcohol to separate the urea from the potassium nitrate. [4] Evaporation of the alcoholic solution yielded crystals of urea. [5] Because an aqueous solution of urea decomposes on boiling to carbonic acid, acetic acid, and ammonia, they speculated that ammonia-containing calculi might be formed by the partial fermentation of urea in the bladder. [1] Finally in 1817, a pure urea product was isolated, its properties, appearance, and chemical reactions were described, and its analysis was accurately determined by William Prout (first exhibited, he said, at some lectures he had given 3 years earlier). [2] Prout introduced a purification step with animal charcoal before extraction with boiling alcohol. [3] This became the textbook method of choice for the preparation of urea. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its preparation and properties, with a mention of its decomposition upon boiling, which produces ammonia and other compounds. The text speculates that ammonia-containing calculi may form from the partial fermentation of urea in the bladder. However, the relationship between urea and fermentation is not extensively detailed, indicating a more indirect connection rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as urea and fermentation are connected through the speculation of urea's decomposition leading to ammonia formation, but there is no detailed discussion of fermentation processes or their direct impact on urea.",
