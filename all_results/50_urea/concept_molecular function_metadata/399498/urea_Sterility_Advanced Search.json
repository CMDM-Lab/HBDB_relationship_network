    "context": "[3] Here, we describe the inhibitive effect of urea on the swarming of P. mirabilis. [4] The use of urea in isolating single non-P. [5] mirabiliscolonies from P. mirabilis-overgrown cultures is discussed. [1] Sterile urea (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) was added to blood agar base 2 (BL2 agar; Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) to a final concentration reaching from 0.0 to 1.5%. [2] Plates were inoculated in the center with 1 \u00ce\u00bcl of a liquid culture of P. mirabilis and incubated at 37\u00c2\u00b0C for 16 to 24 h. [3] On agar plates without urea, growth of P. mirabilis completely covered the plates; however, the diameter of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colonies\u00e2\u20ac\u009d grown on plates containing urea decreased with increasing urea concentration. [1] Next, we tested the usefulness of urea in isolating single colonies ofStaphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus group G spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from mixed cultures withP. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its inhibitory effect on the swarming of P. mirabilis, suggesting its potential role in promoting sterility in culture media. The addition of sterile urea to blood agar base is shown to reduce the growth of P. mirabilis, indicating that urea can help isolate specific bacterial colonies by limiting overgrowth. This suggests a functional relationship where urea contributes to maintaining sterility in mixed cultures by inhibiting certain bacterial growth.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and sterility, as the context provides evidence of urea's inhibitory effects on bacterial growth, supporting its role in promoting sterility in culture media.",
