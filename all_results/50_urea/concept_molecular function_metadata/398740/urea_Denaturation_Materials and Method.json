    "context": "[4] The samples were prepared in triplicate and incubated for 18 h at the experimental temperature before measurements were made. [5] Fluorescence measurements at 4\u00c2\u00b0C were performed on an Aviv Model ATF105 Automated Titrating Differential/Ratio Spectrofluorometer. [6] Emission scans were recorded from 310\u00e2\u20ac\u201c400 nm (excitation at 295 nm). [1] The fluorescence-based urea denaturation curves for the S2loop constructs could not be reliably fit because of steep pretransition baselines. [2] In a manner similar to the S2 fluorescence samples, but without glycerol, 25-\u00ce\u00bcM S2loop samples were prepared for CD. [3] Data were obtained at 4\u00c2\u00b0C and 25\u00c2\u00b0C. [1] The raw data were processed by using excel (Microsoft) and graphed by using kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to fluorescence-based denaturation curves for S2loop constructs. The study indicates challenges in fitting the denaturation curves due to steep pretransition baselines, suggesting that urea plays a role in the denaturation process being analyzed. However, the specific mechanisms or interactions between urea and denaturation are not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is involved in the denaturation process being studied, but the context does not provide extensive details on their interaction or significance beyond the mention of denaturation curves.",
