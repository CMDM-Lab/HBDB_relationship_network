    "context": "[7] Undoubtedly, 19F-NMR has provided a starting point toward achieving these goals. [1] Mutations at position 187 in secreted gelsolin enable aberrant proteolysis at the 172\u00e2\u20ac\u201c173 and 243\u00e2\u20ac\u201c244 amide bonds, affording the 71-residue amyloidogenic peptide deposited in Familial Amyloidosis of Finnish Type (FAF). [2] Thermodynamic comparisons of two different domain 2 constructs were carried out to study possible effects of the mutations on proteolytic susceptibility. [3] In the construct we consider to be most representative of domain 2 in the context of the full-length protein (134\u00e2\u20ac\u201c266), the D187N FAF variant is slightly destabilized relative to wild type (WT) under the conditions of urea denaturation, but exhibits a Tm identical to WT. [4] The D187Y variant is less stable to intermediate urea concentrations and exhibits a Tm that is estimated to be \u00e2\u2030\u02c65\u00c2\u00b0C lower than WT (pH 7.4, Ca2+-free). [5] Although the thermodynamic data indicate that the FAF mutations may slightly destabilize domain 2, these changes are probably not sufficient to shift the native to denatured state equilibrium enough to enable the proteolysis leading to FAF. [6] Biophysical data indicate that these two FAF variants may have different native state structures and possibly different pathways of amyloidosis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to study the stability of the gelsolin variants in relation to their susceptibility to proteolysis. The effects of urea on the denaturation of the protein constructs are analyzed, revealing that the D187N variant is slightly destabilized under urea denaturation conditions, while the D187Y variant shows greater instability. This indicates a direct relationship between urea concentration and the denaturation process of the protein, affecting its structural integrity and potential for amyloidosis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and denaturation, as the context discusses how urea influences the stability and denaturation of protein variants, supported by thermodynamic data. This relationship is crucial for understanding the protein's behavior in the context of amyloidosis.",
