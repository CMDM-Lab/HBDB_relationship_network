    "context": "[3] The higher m value for the D187Y mutant likely reflects an increase in \u00ce\u201dA over the WT protein; this could result from either an increase in the ASA of the unfolded form or a decrease in the ASA of the native form . Several mutants of staphylococcal nuclease with large m values were shown to be unfolded to a greater extent in the denatured state, a factor that may contribute in this case . [4] The 44% increase in ASA is hard to explain by native state changes; however, the dramatic differences in the native state fluorescence of the D187Y variant relative to WT and D187N suggest that native state differences may exist. [5] The presence of a folding intermediate usually lowers the m value and thus is not applicable here . [6] Another possible explanation for the large m value is aggregation during denaturation; however, excellent fits to a monomer in 1.75 M urea for all three S2loop proteins were observed by equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies (data not shown). [1] The LEM estimates D187Y to be more stable than WT in 0 M urea and thus appears to break down in this case. [2] All other data indicate that D187Y is less stable than the WT. [3] Each method of analysis used argues that any destabilization is considerably less than the 2.16 kcal mol\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 derived from biophysical studies on the construct missing the A\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 strand at 15\u00c2\u00b0C (151\u00e2\u20ac\u201c266; see ref. ).

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant used in the study of protein stability, particularly in relation to the D187Y mutant of staphylococcal nuclease. The presence of urea influences the unfolding and denaturation of proteins, affecting their stability and aggregation behavior. The analysis suggests that urea plays a critical role in understanding the denaturation process of the proteins studied, highlighting its importance in protein biochemistry.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and denaturation, as urea is explicitly used to study protein stability and unfolding. The context provides evidence of how urea affects the denaturation process, indicating a clear relationship within the biochemical analysis.",
