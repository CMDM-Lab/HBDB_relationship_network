[3] Data from urea titration (closed circles) and mutagenesis (open circles). [1] To shed further light on the apoSOD1\u00ce\u201dIV\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u201dVII fibrillation process, we used the urea dependencies of \u00ce\u00bdmax and \u00cf\u201elag, which reflect the changes in solvent accessible surface area of the underlying microscopic reaction steps. [2] From the denatured baselines in Fig.\u00c2\u00a02, we obtain \u00e2\u02c6\u201a\u00c2\u00a0log\u00c2\u00a0\u00ce\u00bdmax/\u00e2\u02c6\u201a[urea]\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0m\u00ce\u00bd\u00c2\u00a0max\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0-0.17\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a00.05 and \u00e2\u02c6\u201a\u00c2\u00a0log\u00c2\u00a0\u00cf\u201elag/\u00e2\u02c6\u201a[urea]\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a0m\u00cf\u201elag\u00c2\u00a0=\u00c2\u00a00.13\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a00.06 (Fig.\u00c2\u00a02). [3] The matching absolute values of m\u00ce\u00bdmax and m\u00cf\u201elag lend further support to the existence of a common scaling factor \u00ce\u00ba, as inferred in Eqs.\u00c2\u00a04 and 5. Importantly, this scaling factor allows us to examine the microscopic rate constants k+ and k- within the same conceptual framework as the folding kinetics (Fig.\u00c2\u00a04).

        "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized to investigate the fibrillation process of apoSOD1\u0394IV\u0394VII. The dependencies of the fibrillation lag time and elongation rate constant on urea concentration suggest that urea plays a critical role in modulating the microscopic reaction steps involved in the fibrillation process. The study highlights how changes in urea concentration affect the kinetics of fibrillation, indicating a significant relationship between urea and the underlying processes of protein aggregation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and the fibrillation process, as the context provides evidence of urea's influence on the kinetics of protein aggregation, supported by quantitative data on lag time and elongation rates.",
