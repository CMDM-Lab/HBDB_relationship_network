    "context": " [8] In contrast, incubation of PAI-2 with RCL peptides in which the P14 threonine was removed (13-mer) or mutated to a valine (T14V) did not induce resistance to denaturation, indicating that these peptides were not able to insert and induce the relaxed conformation.  [9] Furthermore, peptides with mutations at both P14 and P13 (13K14V) did not induce resistance to urea denaturation, indicating that these peptides were not able to insert and induce the relaxed conformation (Fig. 1). [10] Interestingly, PAI-2 incubated with scrambled peptide exhibited higher fluorescence in 8 m urea than PAI-2 alone. [11] As the scrambled peptide has no effect on PAI-2 inhibitory activity (see below) and PAI-2 is completely unfolded in 8 m urea , this result may be an artifact of an unusual interaction between denatured PAI-2 and the scrambled peptide. [12] Regardless, it is clear that the scrambled peptide is unable to induce the relaxed conformation of PAI-2. [1] Urea denaturation analysis of  PAI-2 incubated with mutant  RCL peptides. [2] Resistance to denaturation by 8m urea of PAI-2 incubated with 100-fold molar excess of various RCL peptides was monitored by intrinsic fluorescence emission at 360 nm. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in denaturation processes, particularly concerning the protein PAI-2 and its interaction with various peptides. The mention of inhibitors is indirect, as the context focuses on how certain peptides affect the denaturation of PAI-2 in the presence of urea. While inhibitors are implied in the context of preventing denaturation, their specific relationship with urea is not explicitly detailed, leading to a moderate connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is involved in the denaturation process of PAI-2, and inhibitors are indirectly related through their potential role in affecting this process. However, the lack of direct discussion on inhibitors limits the strength of their relationship.",
