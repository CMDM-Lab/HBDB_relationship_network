    "context": " [6] Incubation of PAI-2 with RCL peptide in which only the P13 residue had been mutated (E13Q, E13K) also induced resistance to urea denaturation, indicating peptide insertion and transition to the relaxed state.  [7] Note that a small fraction (\u00e2\u02c6\u00bc15%) of PAI-2 incubated with P13 mutant RCL peptides was denatured (Fig. 1).  [8] In contrast, incubation of PAI-2 with RCL peptides in which the P14 threonine was removed (13-mer) or mutated to a valine (T14V) did not induce resistance to denaturation, indicating that these peptides were not able to insert and induce the relaxed conformation.  [9] Furthermore, peptides with mutations at both P14 and P13 (13K14V) did not induce resistance to urea denaturation, indicating that these peptides were not able to insert and induce the relaxed conformation (Fig. 1). [10] Interestingly, PAI-2 incubated with scrambled peptide exhibited higher fluorescence in 8 m urea than PAI-2 alone. [11] As the scrambled peptide has no effect on PAI-2 inhibitory activity (see below) and PAI-2 is completely unfolded in 8 m urea , this result may be an artifact of an unusual interaction between denatured PAI-2 and the scrambled peptide. [12] Regardless, it is clear that the scrambled peptide is unable to induce the relaxed conformation of PAI-2. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the denaturation of PAI-2, particularly in experiments involving mutated RCL peptides. The mutations at specific residues (P13 and P14) affect the peptide's ability to resist denaturation by urea, indicating a relationship between the structural changes due to mutation and the stability of PAI-2 in the presence of urea. However, the context does not provide a direct link between urea and mutation beyond this experimental observation.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the mutations in the peptides influence their interaction with urea, affecting PAI-2's stability. However, the relationship is primarily experimental and does not delve into broader implications or mechanisms.",
