    "context": " [9] However, when the HeLa cells are confluent, mouse GDPD5-V5 is seen in the region of the plasma membrane as well as in the perinuclear area (Fig. 2D, Lower). [10] We conclude that GDPD5 is a membrane protein, but whether it is located in the plasma membrane, as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum of cultured cells, depends on how confluent the HeLa cells are. [1] Our search for phosphorylation sites by protein mass spectrometry was limited by the fact that we were able to identify only eight peptides, containing 15% of the amino acids in GDPD5 (Table 1), even when we attempted to compensate for the fact that GDPD5 is N-glycosylated and is a membrane protein. [2] The methods that in total yielded the 15% coverage included elution from the immunoprecipitating beads with either 8 M urea or SDS; with or without deglycosylation; digestion either in solution, in gel, or on membrane; proteolytic digestion either with or without Rapigest (which helps solubilize proteins, making them more susceptible to enzymatic cleavage); and digestion with trypsin alone, chymotrypsin followed by trypsin, or proteinase K alone. [3] Nevertheless, one of the peptides that we identified (580-ANANSTApTPVGPR-592) is phosphorylated on threonine 587 (T587, Fig. S1). [1] We initially used targeted ion selection (TIS) to test for effects of high NaCl and high urea on phosphorylation of GDPD5-T587-V5 (Fig. 3 A\u00e2\u20ac\u201cC). [2] HEK293 cells were transfected with GDPD5-V5. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to methods used for protein analysis, specifically in the context of protein mass spectrometry. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding its role in cytokinesis of the fertilized ovum. The mention of urea appears incidental, with no evidence of its relevance to the process of cytokinesis.",
