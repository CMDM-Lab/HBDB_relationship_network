    "context": " [4] (C) H2O2 does not decrease phosphorylation of T587.  [5] HEK293 cells were transfected with GDPD5-V5 at 300 mosmol/kg and then exposed for 1 h to high NaCl, high urea, or 400 \u00c2\u00b5M H2O2.  [6] Phosphorylation of GDPD5-V5 was measured by iTRAQ/TIS (mean \u00c2\u00b1 SEM, n = 3, *P < 0.05 vs. control at 300 mosmol/kg).  [7] (D) Effect of mutations and high NaCl or high urea on GDPD5 activity.  [8] GDPD5 mutants were treated as in A. Additional mutation of T587 to alanine increases the activity of the C25S/C571S mutant, indicating that the mutations act independently.  [9] High NaCl and high urea inhibit activity of the triple mutant, indicating that at least one more site is involved. [10] (E) CDK1/5 inhibitor reduces GPC-PDE activity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the effects of high NaCl and high urea on the activity of GDPD5 mutants. The study indicates that mutations in the GDPD5 protein can influence its activity, and the presence of high urea inhibits the activity of a specific triple mutant. This suggests a potential interaction between urea levels and the functional consequences of mutations in GDPD5, although the exact nature of this relationship is not fully elucidated.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is shown to impact the activity of mutated GDPD5, indicating a connection between urea levels and mutation effects. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration and quantitative data.",
