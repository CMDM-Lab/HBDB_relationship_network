    "context": "[5] Over 30 min, urea uptake in UreI oocytes was accelerated 6- to 10-fold at pH 5.0 compared with pH 7.5 and was the same as in noninjected oocytes at either pH  (Fig. 4, A and C). [6] Control oocytes equilibrated to the same level as oocytes expressing UreI, but required 48 hours to reach equilibrium as compared with 1 hour for ureI-injected oocytes. [7] No increase in internal concentration was found above the increase from equalization of the concentration gradient. [8] Accumulation was consistent with acid-dependent UreI facilitation of urea transport into the 0.4 to 0.6 \u00ce\u00bcl of internal oocyte water space .

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the concept of facilitation through the study of UreI, a protein that enhances urea transport in oocytes. The research indicates that UreI facilitates a significant increase in urea uptake at lower pH levels, demonstrating a direct relationship between urea transport and the facilitative role of UreI in cellular environments. This suggests that UreI is crucial for efficient urea transport, particularly under acidic conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and facilitation, as the study provides evidence of UreI's role in enhancing urea transport, supported by quantitative data on uptake rates at different pH levels.",
        "score": 4
