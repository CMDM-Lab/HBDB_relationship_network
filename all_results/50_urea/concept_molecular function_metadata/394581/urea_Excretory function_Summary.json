[1] This study was designed to elucidate the strategies adopted by mudskippers to handle endogenous ammonia during aerial exposure in constant darkness.  [2] Under these conditions, specimens exhibited minimal locomotory activity, and the ammonia and urea excretion rates in both Periophthalmodon schlosseri and Boleophthalmus boddaerti decreased significantly.  [3] As a consequence, ammonia accumulation occurred in the tissues of both species of mudskipper.  [4] A significant increase in urea levels was found in the liver of P. schlosseri after 24h of aerial exposure, but no similar increase was seen in the tissues of B. boddaerti.  [5] It is unlikely that these two species of mudskipper detoxified ammonia to urea during aerial exposure since B. boddaerti does not possess a complete ornithine-urea cycle (OUC) and, although all the OUC enzymes were present in P. schlosseri, the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase present in the liver mitochondria was too low to render the OUC functional for ammonia detoxification.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to the excretory function of mudskippers during aerial exposure. The study highlights that while ammonia excretion rates decreased, there was a significant increase in urea levels in the liver of one species, Periophthalmodon schlosseri. This suggests that urea plays a role in the excretory function, particularly in the detoxification of ammonia, although the complete ornithine-urea cycle was not functional in the other species, Boleophthalmus boddaerti.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and excretory function, as the study provides evidence of urea's role in ammonia detoxification during aerial exposure, indicating a clear physiological relationship.",
