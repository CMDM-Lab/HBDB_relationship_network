    "context": "[15] Further studies are underway to conclusively determine whether RhAG is an antiporter. [1] Transport across membranes is required to efficiently scavenge NH4 + for use as a nitrogen source in bacteria, yeast, and higher plants; however, little is known about the requirements for NH4 + transport in mammals. [2] It was long assumed that high passive membrane permeability of ammonia (NH3) would obviate the need for specific transport pathways in mammalian cells . [3] Water and urea permeation were originally thought to occur by passive movement through the lipid bilayer but are now known to be mediated by specific proteins. [4] Similarly, rates of passive diffusion are not sufficient to account for the movement of NH4 + in a number of organs . [5] NH4 + movement in the kidney tubular segments is transport-mediated. [6] Uptake is thought to be due, in part, to the ability of NH4 + to substitute for K+ on the Na+-K+-2Cl\u00e2\u02c6\u2019co-transporter  and the Na+,K+-ATPase  or to be carried by the Na+/H+ exchanger .

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its transport mechanisms across cell membranes, particularly in the kidneys, where it is involved in nitrogen metabolism. However, there is no direct mention or connection to Passive Range of Motion function, which typically pertains to joint mobility and physical therapy. Thus, the relationship between urea and Passive Range of Motion function is not established in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant connection between urea and Passive Range of Motion function, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any discussion of their relationship.",
