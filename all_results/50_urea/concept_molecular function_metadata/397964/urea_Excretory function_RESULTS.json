        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the excretory function as it is a key nitrogenous waste product excreted by animals, including the plainfin midshipman. The study measures urea excretion rates, indicating the efficiency of the excretory function in eliminating nitrogenous waste during digestion. The data suggests that urea plays a significant role in the overall nitrogen excretion process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between urea and excretory function, as the context discusses urea excretion rates and their significance in nitrogen waste elimination, indicating a clear physiological relationship supported by experimental data.",
        "score": 4
