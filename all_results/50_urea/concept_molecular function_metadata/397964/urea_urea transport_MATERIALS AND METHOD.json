[13] Images were collected using ZEN imaging software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) at 40\u00c3\u2014 magnification, under oil immersion unless otherwise stated. [1] Whole-animal ammonia (JNH3/NH4+) and urea (JUrea) fluxes to the water were examined using a repeated-measures one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's post hoc test. [2] In vitro tissue urea transport/production was examined using a two-way ANOVA with condition (fasted, fed, fasted + antibiotics) and saline treatment (see Table 1) as factors, followed by appropriate post hoc testing (Tukey's test). [3] Tissue enzyme activity levels and mRNA expression levels were examined using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey's post hoc test.  [1] During the 6 h control period before the consumption of a meal, JNH3/NH4+ and JUrea rates were not significantly different and were collapsed into a single control value of 83.6\u00c2\u00b119.9 and 4.1\u00c2\u00b11.7 \u00ce\u00bcmol N kg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 h\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, respectively, resulting in a pre-prandial percent urea-N excretion of 4.8\u00c2\u00b12.0% of total N (Fig. 1).  [2] A spike in JNH3/NH4+ immediately after feeding was most likely due to the stress of the feeding protocol. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and urea transport are closely related as the study examines urea fluxes and transport mechanisms in tissues. The research involves analyzing urea production and transport under different conditions, indicating that urea transport is a critical process in understanding urea dynamics in the organism. The methodologies employed suggest a direct investigation into how urea is transported and its physiological implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and urea transport, as the context discusses urea transport mechanisms and their examination in relation to urea fluxes. The study's design indicates a clear relationship, although it does not provide extensive quantitative data on the transport process itself.",
