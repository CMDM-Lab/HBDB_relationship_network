    "context": "[2] Deposited in PMC for release after 12 months.  [1] Digestion affects nitrogen metabolism in fish, as both exogenous and endogenous proteins and amino acids are catabolized, liberating ammonia in the process.  [2] Here we present a model of local detoxification of ammonia by the intestinal tissue of the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) during digestion, resulting in an increase in urea excretion of gastrointestinal origin.  [3] Corroborating evidence indicated whole-animal ammonia and urea excretion increased following feeding, and ammonia levels within the lumen of the midshipman intestine increased to high levels (1.8\u00c2\u00b10.4 \u00ce\u00bcmol N g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191).  [4] We propose that this ammonia entered the enterocytes and was detoxified to urea via the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC) enzymes, as evidenced by a 1.5- to 2.9-fold post-prandial increase in glutamine synthetase activity (0.14\u00c2\u00b10.05 and 0.28\u00c2\u00b10.02  [5] \u00ce\u00bcmol min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 versus 0.41\u00c2\u00b10.03  [6] \u00ce\u00bcmol min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) and an 8.7-fold increase in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase III activity (0.3\u00c2\u00b11.2 versus 2.6\u00c2\u00b10.4 nmol min\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 g\u00e2\u02c6\u20191).

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to the excretory function as it is produced from the detoxification of ammonia during digestion in the plainfin midshipman fish. The study highlights that increased urea excretion occurs as a result of the intestinal detoxification process, indicating that urea plays a crucial role in the excretory function of this species, particularly following feeding. The involvement of the ornithine-urea cycle in converting ammonia to urea further emphasizes this relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between urea and excretory function, as the context explicitly discusses urea's role in detoxifying ammonia and its subsequent excretion, demonstrating a critical physiological relationship.",
