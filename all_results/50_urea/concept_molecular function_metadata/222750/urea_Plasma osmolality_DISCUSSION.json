    "context": "[5] This contention draws\nsupport from experiments in which urea pretreatment of R. sylvatica\ncells and organs enhanced their tolerance to freezing\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthawing in\nvitro (; ). [6] The present study extends these findings by demonstrating\nthat physiological levels of urea enhance freezing survival and postfreeze\nrecovery in vivo. [1] Tissue urea levels in urea-loaded frogs remained high during freezing and\nthawing, although concentrations in the frozen\u00e2\u20ac\u201cthawed specimens were\nlower than those in unfrozen frogs (Table\n1), apparently because some of the solute was lost via\nrenal filtration. [2] We found no evidence that urea loading altered tissue\nhydration, plasma osmolality or glycemia, and previous studies\n(;\n) have\nshown it affects neither cutaneous water uptake nor behavior. [3] Thus, we are\nreasonably confident in ascribing the observed variation in survival and\npostfreeze recovery rates of R. sylvatica to differences in uremia\nbetween treatment groups. [1] Experimentally augmenting tissue glucose levels improves freezing survival\nof R. sylvatica, providing strong evidence for the cryoprotective\nfunction of this osmolyte (; ). [2] Similarly, urea loading enhanced survival of R.\nsylvatica subjected to freezing at a potentially lethal temperature,\u00e2\u20ac\u201c\n4\u00c2\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in enhancing the freezing survival and recovery of R. sylvatica. The study indicates that while urea levels were maintained during freezing and thawing, there was no evidence that urea loading altered plasma osmolality. This suggests that urea's protective effects during freezing are not directly linked to changes in plasma osmolality, indicating a more complex interaction where urea serves as a cryoprotectant without significantly affecting osmotic balance.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is shown to have a role in freezing survival, but its relationship with plasma osmolality is explicitly stated as unchanged, indicating that while they are related in the context of physiological effects, their direct interaction is not significant.",
