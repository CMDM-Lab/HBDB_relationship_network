    "context": "[4] A similar weight gain was observed in all groups. [1] 3. Nitrogen absorption (76%, SD 4; n = 3) was not significantly different between groups. [2] Apparent urea balance was significantly increased and became positive in the group receiving the formula with the higher proportion of non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen. [3] Nitrogen retention, however, was significantly depressed in this group, indicating decreased efficiency of nitrogen utilization at this level of non-protein nitrogen despite an enhanced urea salvage. [1] 4. The enrichment of the 15N label in urinary urea at isotopic steady state was significantly reduced in infants receiving the highest urea-containing formula, presumably due to the dilution of 15N-labelled urea by dietary urea. [2] No difference, however, was found in the enrichment of the 15N label in urinary ammonia. [3] Rates of \u00ce\u00b1-amino nitrogen flux, protein synthesis and protein breakdown calculated from the ammonia labelling did not differ significantly between groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen utilization are interconnected through the assessment of nitrogen absorption and retention in infants receiving different formulas. The study indicates that while urea balance increased with higher non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen intake, nitrogen retention decreased, suggesting a complex relationship where enhanced urea production does not equate to efficient nitrogen utilization. This highlights the role of urea in nitrogen metabolism and its implications for dietary formulations.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and nitrogen utilization, as the context discusses how changes in urea levels affect nitrogen retention and absorption. The findings indicate a clear relationship supported by experimental data, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.",
