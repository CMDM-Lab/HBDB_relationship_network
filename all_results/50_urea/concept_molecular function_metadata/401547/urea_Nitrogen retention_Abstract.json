    "context": "[4] A similar weight gain was observed in all groups. [1] 3. Nitrogen absorption (76%, SD 4; n = 3) was not significantly different between groups. [2] Apparent urea balance was significantly increased and became positive in the group receiving the formula with the higher proportion of non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen. [3] Nitrogen retention, however, was significantly depressed in this group, indicating decreased efficiency of nitrogen utilization at this level of non-protein nitrogen despite an enhanced urea salvage. [1] 4. The enrichment of the 15N label in urinary urea at isotopic steady state was significantly reduced in infants receiving the highest urea-containing formula, presumably due to the dilution of 15N-labelled urea by dietary urea. [2] No difference, however, was found in the enrichment of the 15N label in urinary ammonia. [3] Rates of \u00ce\u00b1-amino nitrogen flux, protein synthesis and protein breakdown calculated from the ammonia labelling did not differ significantly between groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen retention are interconnected through the assessment of nitrogen utilization efficiency in infants receiving different formulas. While the apparent urea balance increased with higher non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen intake, nitrogen retention was significantly depressed, indicating that despite enhanced urea salvage, the efficiency of nitrogen utilization was compromised. This suggests a complex relationship where increased urea levels do not necessarily correlate with improved nitrogen retention.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and nitrogen retention, as the context discusses how changes in urea levels impact nitrogen utilization efficiency. The findings indicate a clear relationship supported by experimental observations, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.",
