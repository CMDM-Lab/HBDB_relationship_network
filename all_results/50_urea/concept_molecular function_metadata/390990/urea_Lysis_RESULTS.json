[2] A series of 10 random geometries was then computed, and each was subjected to dynamic simulated annealing using Discover (Accelrys). [3] Similarly, 10 random geometry models of -4GlcNAc\u00ce\u00b21-6Gal\u00ce\u00b21-linked poly-LacNAc, also containing five LacNAc repeats, were generated and subjected to simulated annealing.  [1] Extraction of Ricin-binding Glycoproteins\u00e2\u20ac\u201dTo extract all types of membrane-associated glycoconjugates, osmotically lysed T. brucei cells were completely solubilized in 8 m urea and 3% SDS for 30 min before dilution of the extract and addition of ricin coupled to agarose.  [2] Rechromatography of the unbound fraction showed that the majority of the ricin-binding material was captured in the first round of chromatography (data not shown).  [3] The native glycoproteins eluted from the ricin-coupled agarose range in apparent molecular mass from 35 to more than 188 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1).  [4] Reduction with 1 m dithiothreitol resulted in the disappearance of bands over 188 kDa and the appearance of smaller molecular mass glycoproteins (Fig. 1A, lane 2), suggesting disulfide linkages between some of the constituent glycoproteins.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a component in the extraction process of membrane-associated glycoconjugates from osmotically lysed T. brucei cells. The lysis of the cells allows for the solubilization of proteins, and urea plays a role in denaturing proteins to facilitate their extraction. However, the specific relationship between urea and the lysis process is not deeply explored beyond its use in the methodology.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is directly involved in the lysis process of T. brucei cells for protein extraction, indicating a functional relationship. However, the context does not provide extensive details on how urea specifically influences lysis beyond its role in the extraction protocol.",
