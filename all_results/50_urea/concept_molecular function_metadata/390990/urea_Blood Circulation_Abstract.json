    "context": "[7] This is one possible biological implication of our study of TMAO-protein interaction at pH of <5.0.  [1] The flagellar pocket of the bloodstream form of the African sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei contains material that binds the \u00ce\u00b2-d-galactose-specific lectin ricin (Brickman, M. J., and Balber, A. E. (1990) J. Protozool.  [2] 37, 219\u00e2\u20ac\u201c224).  [3] Glycoproteins were solubilized from bloodstream form T. brucei cells in 8 m urea and 3% SDS and purified by ricin affinity chromatography.  [4] Essentially all binding of ricin to these glycoproteins was abrogated by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase, showing that the ricin ligands are attached to glycoproteins via N-glycosidic linkages to asparagine residues.  [5] Glycans released by peptide N-glycosidase were resolved by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration into two fractions: a low molecular mass mannose-rich fraction and a high molecular mass galactose and N-acetylglucosamine-rich fraction.  [6] The latter fraction was further separated by high pH anion exchange chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional NMR, electrospray mass spectrometry, and methylation linkage analysis.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to biochemical processes involving glycoproteins and their interactions, but there is no direct discussion of its role in blood circulation. While urea is a waste product excreted through the kidneys and is present in blood, the context does not establish a clear relationship between urea and blood circulation, focusing instead on the biochemical analysis of glycoproteins in the Trypanosoma brucei parasite.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between urea and blood circulation in the provided context. Urea is mentioned, but its connection to blood circulation is not discussed, indicating a coincidental mention rather than a significant relationship.",
