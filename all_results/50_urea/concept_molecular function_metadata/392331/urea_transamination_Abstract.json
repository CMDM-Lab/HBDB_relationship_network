    "context": "[3] It seems that there is little potential for orexins alone to be served clinically as an intrathecal treatment of postoperative pain. [4] Besides, the exophthalmos and cardiovascular excitation (; ) induced by central administration of orexins might deter its clinical potential. [5] However, it still remains to be elucidated if other related orexin receptor agonists, when available, can be used as adjuvant analgesics in the treatment of postoperative pain. [1] The present study was designed to determine: (i) the role of the reductive amination of \u00ce\u00b1-ketoglutarate via the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction in furnishing mitochondrial glutamate and its transamination into aspartate; (ii) the relative incorporation of perfusate 15NH4Cl, [2-15N]glutamine or [5-15N]glutamine into carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate-N and, thereby, [15N]urea isotopomers; and (iii) the extent to which perfusate [15N]aspartate is taken up by the liver and incorporated into [15N]urea. [2] We used a liver-perfusion system containing a physiological mixture of amino acids and ammonia similar to concentrations in vivo, with 15N label only in glutamine, ammonia or aspartate. [3] The results demonstrate that in perfusions with a physiological mixture of amino acids, approx. [4] 45 and 30% of total urea-N output was derived from perfusate ammonia and glutamine-N respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and transamination are related through the metabolic processes occurring in the liver. The study investigates the incorporation of nitrogen from amino acids and ammonia into urea, highlighting the role of transamination reactions in generating aspartate, which is subsequently utilized in urea synthesis. The results indicate that a significant portion of urea nitrogen originates from transaminated substrates, demonstrating the interconnectedness of these metabolic pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and transamination, as the study provides evidence of how transamination contributes to urea synthesis through the incorporation of nitrogen from amino acids and ammonia. This relationship is crucial in understanding nitrogen metabolism.",
