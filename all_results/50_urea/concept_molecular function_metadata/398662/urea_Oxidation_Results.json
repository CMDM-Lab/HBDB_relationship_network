    "context": " [5] As little as 5 mM urea significantly carbonylates proteins in mIMCD3 cells within 15 min (Fig. 2C ).  [6] The amount of carbonylation apparently peaks at 20 mM.  [7] However, oxidation may be even greater at higher urea concentration.  [8] Carbonylation at higher urea concentrations may decrease because the carbonyl groups are susceptible to further oxidation to carboxylic acids.  [9] For example, initial oxidation of glutamine synthetase converts an arginine residue to the carbonyl-bearing derivative, \u00ce\u00b3-glutamyl semialdehyde, but this derivative can be further oxidized to glutamic acid. [10] Of note, 5 mM urea is a normal plasma concentration, and the range in uremia is 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c80 mM. [11] Thus, the level of urea normally present in blood can cause protein carbonylation, and the higher urea in renal failure can account for the increased carbonylation observed in that condition .

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to oxidation through its role in protein carbonylation in mIMCD3 cells. The study indicates that urea concentrations can lead to the carbonylation of proteins, with higher concentrations potentially increasing oxidation levels. This suggests that urea not only contributes to protein modification but also interacts with oxidative processes, particularly in conditions like renal failure where urea levels are elevated.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and oxidation, as the context provides evidence of urea-induced protein carbonylation and discusses how higher urea concentrations can enhance oxidation. This relationship is particularly relevant in the context of renal failure.",
