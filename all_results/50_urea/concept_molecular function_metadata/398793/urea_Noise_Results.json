    "context": "[6] The distributions are significantly broader than the shot noise. [7] The distribution associated with the partially folded peptide in 3.0 M urea is well described by the 45% of the folded plus 55% of the unfolded distributions. [1] (Left) Probability distributions of the average donor acceptor separation measured on the aminosilanized cover slips from optimally filtered trajectories. [2] (Right) Probability distributions under different urea concentrations measured on freely diffusing GCN4-Pf with shot noise broadening of a single value overlaid for comparison.  [1] Conformational fluctuations of the protein cause changes in the coordinate r.  [2] The resulting fluctuations in the signal will persist for as long as the underlying fluctuations.  [3] To measure their time scale(s), we obtained the donor and acceptor auto- and crosscorrelation functions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the study of protein conformational fluctuations and their effects on signal measurements. The noise referred to is likely related to shot noise and fluctuations in the signal caused by the conformational changes of the protein in varying urea concentrations. However, the relationship between urea and noise is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more indirect connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as urea and noise are connected through the broader context of protein dynamics and signal fluctuations, but their specific relationship is not elaborated upon in detail.",
