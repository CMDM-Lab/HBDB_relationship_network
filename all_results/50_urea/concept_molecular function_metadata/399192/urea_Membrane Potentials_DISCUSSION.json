    "context": "[16] The activation of cytoplasmic urease, the increase in membrane potential with the addition of urea at acidic pH and the positive Western blot analysis strongly suggest that ureI is present in H. mustelae. [1] UreI was not detected by Western analysis nor was there a PCR product for the ureI gene in any of the nongastricHelicobacter spp. [2] Although urease activity was present in their lysates, no increase of urease activity at acidic pH was detected in the intact nongastric Helicobacter species. [3] Additionally, there was no increase in transmembrane potential following urea addition at acidic pH in any of the nongastric species. [4] Taken together, these findings suggest that UreI is absent or is nonfunctional in the nongastric Helicobacter species. [1] The pH optimum of urease activity in intact H. muridarum was similar to the pH optimum of its total cell lysate. [2] This finding may imply relatively rapid diffusion of urea into the cytoplasm of H. muridarum in contrast to the other Helicobacter spp. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to membrane potentials through its role in activating cytoplasmic urease in Helicobacter species. The addition of urea at acidic pH resulted in an increase in membrane potential in H. mustelae, suggesting a functional relationship between urea and membrane dynamics. However, this effect was not observed in nongastric Helicobacter species, indicating a specific interaction in certain contexts.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and membrane potentials, as the context provides evidence of urea's role in altering membrane potential in specific Helicobacter species, supported by experimental findings. However, the lack of effect in other species suggests a more nuanced relationship.",
