    "context": "[1] Fluorescence quenching due to potential-dependent uptake of the dye was measured in a fluorimeter set at an excitation wavelength of 600 nm and an emission wavelength of 665 nm. [2] The dye solution was added 5 min before adding the bacteria to allow temperature equilibration. [3] With addition of the bacteria, the fluorescence quenched due to dye uptake driven by the interior negative potential. [4] After the fluorescence reached equilibrium with the membrane potential, 5 mM urea was added, and the change in fluorescence was measured. [5] All experiments were done at 37\u00c2\u00b0C. [6] Calibration of the membrane potential was carried out as previously described by the addition of valinomycin followed by the addition of K+ until no further change in fluorescence was observed . [7] This enables calculation of the K+ equilibrium potential found with the addition of the K+ selective ionophore, valinomycin, by using the Nernst equation: PD = 61 log 5/[K+]i, where [K+]i is equal to the external K+concentration at which the potential difference becomes zero in the presence of valinomycin, i.e., where [K+]out = [K+]in, and 5 mM is the medium concentration when valinomycin is first added.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is introduced as a component added to a system to observe its effect on fluorescence quenching, which is linked to membrane potentials. The experiment measures changes in fluorescence after adding urea, indicating its role in influencing the membrane potential of the bacteria. However, the specific interaction between urea and membrane potentials is not elaborated upon, focusing instead on the measurement techniques and calibration methods used in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is involved in the experimental setup to assess changes in membrane potential, but the relationship is not deeply explored or quantified beyond its role in the fluorescence measurement.",
