    "context": "[8] *P < 0.01. [1] Hypertonic medium, established by the addition of NaCl or sucrose, induce osmotic mpkCCDcl4 cell shrinkage  whereas hyperosmotic medium, established by the addition of urea which easily crosses the plasma membrane, does not appreciably alter cell volume (Hasler, unpublished results). [2] We studied the respective influence of hypertonic challenge, after the addition of sucrose, and hyperosmotic challenge, after the addition of urea, on AQP2 expression. [3] Western blot analysis showed that supplementation of the cell medium with either sucrose or urea decreased AQP2 protein expression to similar extents and in a concentration-dependent manner after 3 h in AVP-pretreated cells (Figure 3, A and B). [4] Consistent with Western blot analysis, RT-PCR experiments showed that AQP2 mRNA content decreased in cells incubated in either sucrose- or urea-supplemented medium for 3 h (Figure 3C, left panel). [5] Sucrose, but not urea, supplementation increased AR mRNA expression (Figure 3C, right panel), indicating that in contrast to hypertonic sucrose, hyperosmotic urea does not induce a typical hypertonicity-dependent response. [6] Because PKA is a major stimulatory factor that enhances AQP2 gene expression , we wondered whether PKA inhibition might explain the decreased levels of AQP2 expression occurring in mpkCCDcl4 cells exposed to short periods (3 h) of hypertonic challenge.

        "summary": "In this context, urea is examined for its effect on AQP2 protein expression in mpkCCDcl4 cells under hyperosmotic conditions. The study shows that the addition of urea decreases AQP2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to the effects observed with sucrose. This indicates that urea influences protein expression related to osmotic challenges, although it does not induce the same hypertonicity-dependent response as sucrose.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and protein expression, as the study provides evidence of urea's role in decreasing AQP2 expression, supported by quantitative data from Western blot and RT-PCR analyses.",
