    "context": "[2] We studied the respective influence of hypertonic challenge, after the addition of sucrose, and hyperosmotic challenge, after the addition of urea, on AQP2 expression. [3] Western blot analysis showed that supplementation of the cell medium with either sucrose or urea decreased AQP2 protein expression to similar extents and in a concentration-dependent manner after 3 h in AVP-pretreated cells (Figure 3, A and B). [4] Consistent with Western blot analysis, RT-PCR experiments showed that AQP2 mRNA content decreased in cells incubated in either sucrose- or urea-supplemented medium for 3 h (Figure 3C, left panel). [5] Sucrose, but not urea, supplementation increased AR mRNA expression (Figure 3C, right panel), indicating that in contrast to hypertonic sucrose, hyperosmotic urea does not induce a typical hypertonicity-dependent response. [6] Because PKA is a major stimulatory factor that enhances AQP2 gene expression , we wondered whether PKA inhibition might explain the decreased levels of AQP2 expression occurring in mpkCCDcl4 cells exposed to short periods (3 h) of hypertonic challenge. [7] This is unlikely because, in agreement with the results of previous work , 3 h of hypertonic NaCl stimulation slightly but significantly increased PKA activity in a concentration-dependent manner.  [1] Short-term hyperosmotic challenge downregulates AQP2 expression. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is examined in relation to its hyperosmotic effects on AQP2 expression. The study shows that hyperosmotic challenge with urea leads to a decrease in AQP2 protein and mRNA levels, indicating that urea does not induce a typical hypertonicity-dependent response like sucrose does. This suggests a distinct role for urea in modulating cellular responses to hyperosmotic conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and the hyperosmotic response, as the study provides evidence of urea's impact on AQP2 expression under hyperosmotic conditions, highlighting a clear relationship in the context of cellular responses to osmotic challenges.",
