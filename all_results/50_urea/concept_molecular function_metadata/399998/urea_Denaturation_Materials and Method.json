    "context": "[1] RCH alone, urea (7 M) alone, or RCH plus urea (7 M) was added to sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.5). [2] Incubations were initiated by addition of 13-cRA, and the reactions were carried out for 20, 40, 60, or 120 min at 37\u00c2\u00b0C in the dark. [3] Longer incubation times (60 and 120 min) were used in this experiment, to ensure that the denaturation of isomerases by urea could be observed at several time points. [4] The effects of urea denaturation were determined by assessing the differences between the t-RA generation from incubations with RCH plus urea and the t-RA generation from incubations with urea alone. [5] Following the same procedures, GSH alone, urea alone, or GSH plus urea was incubated with 13-cRA, and the effects of urea on GSH-catalyzed 13-cRA isomerizations were determined.  [1] The solvent delivery system for HPLC consisted of two model 100A dual-piston Beckman pumps linked together for activation of a binary gradient.  [2] The system was interfaced with a Shimadzu SPD-10A UV/visible detector (set at 354 nm) and a Shimadzu C-R5A Chromatopac data processor. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used to induce denaturation of isomerases during incubations with 13-cRA. The study aims to observe the effects of urea on the denaturation process over various time points, specifically assessing how urea influences the generation of t-RA compared to controls. This indicates a direct relationship where urea acts as a denaturing agent affecting enzyme activity.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and denaturation, as the context explicitly discusses urea's role in denaturing isomerases and its effects on enzymatic reactions, supported by experimental observations.",
        "score": 4
