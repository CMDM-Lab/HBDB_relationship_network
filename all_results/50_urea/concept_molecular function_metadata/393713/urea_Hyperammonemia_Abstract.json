    "context": "[3] The urea cycle is an essential pathway to eliminate ammonia through its conversion to urea (Fig. 1). [4] Because the enzymes involved in this pathway are highly expressed in the liver, this organ has an essential role in ammonia elimination. [5] Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), the second enzyme in the urea cycle, catalyzes the condensation of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline . [6] OTC deficiency, the most common and severe inborn error in the urea cycle, causes hyperammonemia, mental retardation, and finally death because of hyperammonemic coma . [1] Schematic representation of ureagenesis pathway. [2] Amino acids were converted into ammonia (NH3) via transamination by aminotransferases such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) followed by oxidative deamination by glutamate dehydrogenase and glutaminase. [3] Ammonia is then converted into urea via the urea cycle (CPS I, OTC, ASS, ASL, and arginase I). ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and hyperammonemia are directly related through the urea cycle, which is crucial for converting ammonia into urea for elimination from the body. A deficiency in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), an enzyme in this cycle, leads to the accumulation of ammonia (hyperammonemia), resulting in severe neurological consequences. This highlights the critical role of urea in preventing hyperammonemia.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between urea and hyperammonemia, as the urea cycle's dysfunction due to OTC deficiency leads to hyperammonemia, emphasizing the importance of urea in ammonia detoxification.",
