[2] We performed all fluorescence experiments using a protein concentration of 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c40 \u00ce\u00bcm in a total volume of 0.8 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 \u00ce\u00bcm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol on a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ).  [3] We incubated individual 0.8-ml solutions of the Runt domain with increasing concentrations of urea (0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6.0 m) and equilibrated the samples for 2 h at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C prior to fluorescence measurement to follow the Runt domain denaturation.  [4] We excited the samples at a wavelength of 280 nm and detected the emission at 340 nm.  [5] We took background spectra of the buffer alone for later subtraction.  [6] We then recorded spectra in the range of 300\u00e2\u20ac\u201c370 nm with an increment of 4 nm and an integration time of 1 s, and averaged two scans to minimize error. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to monitor the denaturation of the Runt domain protein through fluorescence spectroscopy. The study involves incubating the Runt domain with increasing concentrations of urea, which facilitates the unfolding of the protein structure, allowing for the assessment of denaturation via tryptophan fluorescence. This indicates a direct relationship where urea acts as a chemical agent that induces denaturation in proteins.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as urea is explicitly used to induce denaturation of the Runt domain, demonstrating a critical and direct relationship in the context of protein chemistry and biochemistry.",
        "score": 5
