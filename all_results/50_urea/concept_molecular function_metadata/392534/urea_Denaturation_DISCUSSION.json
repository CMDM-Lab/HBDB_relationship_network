    "context": "[5] In addition, the N109A mutation that significantly destabilized the Runt domain fold also caused a large perturbation in CBF\u00ce\u00b2 binding (2.22 kcal/mol). [6] A proportional effect on in vivo function was also demonstrated for the T161A and N109A mutations in the context of full-length Runx1. [1] Asn-109 is located at the C-terminal end of strand \u00ce\u00b2C in the Runt domain and makes van der Waals contacts to CBF\u00ce\u00b2 residue Gly-61, a residue that we demonstrated previously is also very sensitive to alanine substitution. [2] Although the N109A substitution should not affect the contact to CBF\u00ce\u00b2 per se, the perturbations seen in the NMR and urea denaturation data indicate that the N109A mutation causes an alteration in the Runt domain structure that contributes to the observed change in affinity. [3] In the ternary complex the Runt domain Asn-109 ND2 forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain O of Ser-140 in the \u00ce\u00b2E\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-F loop, whereas OD1 interacts with the backbone nitrogens of Glu-111 and Asn-112 in the \u00ce\u00b2C-D loop (Fig. 6C). [4] Thus removal of the Asn-109 side chain may destabilize both loops, which could affect not only the Asn-109 O contact to the CA of CBF\u00ce\u00b2 Gly-61, but also other Runt domain residues that contact CBF\u00ce\u00b2 such as Tyr-113 and Ser-114. [5] Consistent with this hypothesis, the dissociation constant (K3) of the wild type Runt domain for CBF\u00ce\u00b2(G61A) is 3.5 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 m, whereas the K3 for the RD(N109A) with CBF\u00ce\u00b2(G61A) is 13-fold higher (4.6 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 m (not shown)).

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to denaturation, specifically in the context of studying the stability of the Runt domain structure. Urea is commonly used as a denaturant in biochemical studies to disrupt protein structures. The data indicates that the N109A mutation affects the stability of the Runt domain, which is assessed through urea denaturation experiments, suggesting a direct relationship between urea and the denaturation process of the protein structure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and denaturation, as urea is utilized to assess the stability of the Runt domain in the context of mutations. The experimental data supports this relationship, indicating that urea plays a critical role in understanding protein denaturation.",
