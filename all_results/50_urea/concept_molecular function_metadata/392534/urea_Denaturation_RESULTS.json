    "context": "[1] Although NMR spectra are very sensitive to the structural integrity of the protein, they do not provide a quantitative measure of protein stability. [2] In addition, other factors such as protein aggregation can affect the quality of NMR spectra, and a perturbed spectrum may not reliably reflect an altered protein fold. [3] Therefore, for those mutants that showed altered NMR spectra, we also carried out urea denaturation measurements as an independent and quantitative measure of the effect of alanine substitution on protein stability (Table II). [4] Denaturation with urea was monitored by means of the change in the fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue in the Runt domain, as described previously . [5] Representative data for the wild type Runt domain and three of the mutant proteins are shown (Fig. 3). [6] We carried out all measurements at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C, which is approximately the same temperature at which we determined the equilibrium binding constants summarized in Tables III and IV. [7] Table II shows the relevant thermodynamic parameters obtained from fitting the data to a two-state model. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to assess protein stability through denaturation measurements. The study employs urea to monitor changes in the fluorescence of a tryptophan residue in the Runt domain, providing a quantitative measure of how alanine substitutions affect protein stability. This indicates a direct relationship where urea plays a critical role in the denaturation process of proteins.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between urea and denaturation, as urea is explicitly used to induce denaturation in the study, demonstrating its critical role in evaluating protein stability.",
        "score": 5
