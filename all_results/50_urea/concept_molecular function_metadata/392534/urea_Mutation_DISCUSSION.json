    "context": "[5] In addition, the N109A mutation that significantly destabilized the Runt domain fold also caused a large perturbation in CBF\u00ce\u00b2 binding (2.22 kcal/mol). [6] A proportional effect on in vivo function was also demonstrated for the T161A and N109A mutations in the context of full-length Runx1. [1] Asn-109 is located at the C-terminal end of strand \u00ce\u00b2C in the Runt domain and makes van der Waals contacts to CBF\u00ce\u00b2 residue Gly-61, a residue that we demonstrated previously is also very sensitive to alanine substitution. [2] Although the N109A substitution should not affect the contact to CBF\u00ce\u00b2 per se, the perturbations seen in the NMR and urea denaturation data indicate that the N109A mutation causes an alteration in the Runt domain structure that contributes to the observed change in affinity. [3] In the ternary complex the Runt domain Asn-109 ND2 forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain O of Ser-140 in the \u00ce\u00b2E\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2-F loop, whereas OD1 interacts with the backbone nitrogens of Glu-111 and Asn-112 in the \u00ce\u00b2C-D loop (Fig. 6C). [4] Thus removal of the Asn-109 side chain may destabilize both loops, which could affect not only the Asn-109 O contact to the CA of CBF\u00ce\u00b2 Gly-61, but also other Runt domain residues that contact CBF\u00ce\u00b2 such as Tyr-113 and Ser-114. [5] Consistent with this hypothesis, the dissociation constant (K3) of the wild type Runt domain for CBF\u00ce\u00b2(G61A) is 3.5 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c7 m, whereas the K3 for the RD(N109A) with CBF\u00ce\u00b2(G61A) is 13-fold higher (4.6 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 m (not shown)).

        "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to the mutation discussed, specifically the N109A mutation in the Runt domain. The mutation affects the structural stability and binding affinity of the Runt domain to CBF\u03b2, which may influence urea metabolism indirectly through altered protein function. However, urea itself is not directly mentioned as being affected by the mutation, nor is there a clear biochemical link established between them in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as the mutation impacts protein structure and function, which could relate to metabolic processes involving urea, but there is no direct evidence or detailed discussion linking urea to the mutation.",
