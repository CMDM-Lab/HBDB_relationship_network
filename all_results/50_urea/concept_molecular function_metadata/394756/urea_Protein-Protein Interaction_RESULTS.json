    "context": "[1] In a second step, increasing concentrations of each MAP were overlaid onto a constant amount of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin separated by one-dimensional PAGE and immobilized onto nitrocellulose. [2] Fig. 1(B\u00e2\u20ac\u201cD) shows that the saturation curves of the \u00ce\u00b1- and the \u00ce\u00b2-tubulin subunits with the different MAPs are completely superimposed, indicating that MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 each have the same intrinsic capacity to bind to either tubulin subunit. [3] In these experimental overlay conditions, the half-saturation values were found to be similar (20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 nm) for the different MAPs. [1] The protein-protein interactions between nitrocellulose-bound tubulin and soluble MAP1A or MAP2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of salt or urea were also tested by blot overlay. [2] Binding of MAP1A and MAP2 to tubulin was differentially affected by these treatments (Fig. 2). [3] Interaction of MAP1A appeared to be significantly more sensitive to salt when compared with MAP2 (Fig. 2, A and B). [4] For example, addition of 50 mm NaCl resulted in a 50% decrease in MAP1A binding (Fig. 2 A), whereas the presence of up to 75 mm NaCl did not affect the binding of MAP2 (Fig.2 B). ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a treatment condition in the study of protein-protein interactions between microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and tubulin. The binding of MAP1A and MAP2 to tubulin was assessed under varying concentrations of salt or urea, indicating that urea may influence the stability or affinity of these interactions. However, the specific role of urea in modulating these interactions is not elaborated upon, making the relationship somewhat indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea is involved in the experimental conditions affecting protein-protein interactions, but the context does not provide detailed insights into how urea specifically alters these interactions beyond its mention as a treatment condition.",
