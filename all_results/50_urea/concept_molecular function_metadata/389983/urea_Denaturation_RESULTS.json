[7] Fluorescence-monitored urea denaturation of the F31W mutant of PSD-95 PDZ3 (right axis); mD-N = 1.06 \u00c2\u00b1 0.03 kcal mol-1 m-1, [urea]50% = 5.53 \u00c2\u00b1 0.02 m, and \u00ce\u201dGD-N = 5.9 \u00c2\u00b1 0.08 kcal mol-1 (fitting errors).  [1] Ligand Binding\u00e2\u20ac\u201dThe dansylated peptide D-KQTSV, corresponding to the C terminus of the protein CRIPT , was used with PSD-95 PDZ3 in stopped-flow binding experiments.  [2] Upon binding of the peptide to PSD-95 PDZ3 the fluorescence of the dansyl group was increased (\u00ce\u00bbexc = 345 nm; \u00ce\u00bbem > 420 nm), and time-resolved binding traces could be recorded (Fig. 3).  [3] In binding experiments with PTP-BL PDZ2, the dansylated peptide used was D-EQVSAV, corresponding to the C terminus of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RA-GEF-2  and shown previously to interact with human PTP-BL PDZ2 .

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant in the study of the protein PSD-95 PDZ3. The circular dichroism and fluorescence-monitored experiments demonstrate how varying concentrations of urea lead to the denaturation of the protein, indicating its role in unfolding protein structures. The data suggest a quantitative relationship between urea concentration and the degree of denaturation, highlighting urea's effectiveness as a denaturant in biochemical studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between urea and denaturation, as the context explicitly discusses urea's role in denaturing the protein PSD-95 PDZ3, supported by quantitative data on denaturation parameters.",
        "score": 5
