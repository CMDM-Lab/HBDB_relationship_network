[4] Urea-induced denaturation experiments for PSD-95 PDZ3 were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate and 21 mm potassium chloride at 25 \u00c2\u00b0C (I = 150 mm).  [5] The pH and urea denaturation of wild-type PSD-95 PDZ3 was monitored by far-UV circular dichroism in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter.  [6] Urea denaturation of the F31W mutant of PSD-95 PDZ3 was monitored by following Trp fluorescence in an SLM 4800 spectrofluorimeter (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL).  [7] Data were fitted to the standard equation for solvent denaturation .  [8] Binding kinetics were measured at 10 \u00c2\u00b0C on an SX-18MV spectrometer or a \u00cf\u20ac*-180 spectrometer, both from Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK).  [9] PDZ and peptide at different concentrations in identical buffers were rapidly mixed, and fluorescence was monitored using either the dansyl group in the peptide as probe (excitation at 345 nm, emission at >420 nm) or an engineered tryptophan (F31W in PSD-95 PDZ3 and Y43W in PTP-BL PDZ2) in the PDZ domain (excitation at 280 nm, emission at >360 nm or >475 nm).

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant in experiments involving the protein PSD-95 PDZ3. The study monitors the effects of urea on the denaturation process of this protein, utilizing techniques such as circular dichroism and fluorescence to assess changes in structure and binding kinetics. This indicates a direct relationship where urea plays a critical role in inducing denaturation of the protein under specific experimental conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between urea and denaturation, as urea is explicitly used to induce denaturation in the experiments described. The context provides detailed methodologies and observations that highlight the significant role of urea in altering the protein's structure.",
