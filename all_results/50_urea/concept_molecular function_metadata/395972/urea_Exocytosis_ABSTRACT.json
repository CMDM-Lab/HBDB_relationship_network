    "context": "[2] This variability confounds the evaluation of in vitro functional assays performed using HLCs. [3] Increased differentiation efficiency and more accurate approximation of the in vivo hepatocyte gene expression profile would improve the utility of hPSCs. [4] Towards this goal, we demonstrate the purification of a subpopulation of functional HLCs using the hepatocyte surface marker asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGR1). [5] We analyzed the expression profile of ASGR1-positive cells by microarray, and tested their ability to perform mature hepatocyte functions (albumin and urea secretion, cytochrome activity). [6] By these measures, ASGR1-positive HLCs are enriched for the gene expression profile and functional characteristics of primary hepatocytes compared with unsorted HLCs. [7] We have demonstrated that ASGR1-positive sorting isolates a functional subpopulation of HLCs from among the heterogeneous cellular population produced by directed differentiation. [1] The hepatocyte mediates many liver functions by carrying out a multitude of activities at the cellular level. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a product of mature hepatocyte functions, specifically in relation to albumin and urea secretion. While exocytosis is a cellular process involved in the secretion of substances, including urea from hepatocytes, the context does not explicitly detail the mechanism of exocytosis in relation to urea secretion. However, the implication is that urea secretion likely involves exocytotic processes in functional hepatocytes.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as urea secretion is a function of hepatocytes that likely involves exocytosis, but the context does not provide detailed insights into their direct relationship or mechanisms.",
