    "context": "[3] The conversion into \u00ce\u00b2-sheets is followed by aggregation into amyloid fibers . [4] The peptide PrP (109\u00e2\u20ac\u201c141) is of particular interest because structural data are available and its aggregation properties are well documented . [5] The slightly longer peptide, PrP (109\u00e2\u20ac\u201c149), was chosen because it contains a tryptophan residue at position 145 and it would be helpful for the fluorescence measurements. [6] In mixed water/organic solvents and detergents, the peptide PrP (109\u00e2\u20ac\u201c141) assumes a stable \u00ce\u00b1-helical structure , and the random-coil structure is stable in the presence of high urea concentrations. [1] The aggregation of prion peptides was monitored by different spectroscopic measurements. [2] The peptides were unfolded in buffer at pH 4.0\u00e2\u20ac\u201c5.0 [3] containing 6 m urea and were further diluted in the same buffer without the denaturant. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and detergents are mentioned in relation to the structural stability of the peptide PrP (109\u2013141). Urea is noted for maintaining a stable random-coil structure in high concentrations, while detergents facilitate the formation of a stable \u03b1-helical structure in mixed solvents. This indicates that both substances influence the peptide's conformation, but their specific roles and interactions are not deeply explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both urea and detergents are involved in the structural analysis of the peptide, indicating their roles in protein folding and stability. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions between them.",
