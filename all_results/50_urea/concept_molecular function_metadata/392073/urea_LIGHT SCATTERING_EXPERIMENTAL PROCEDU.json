[1] Spectroscopic Measurements\u00e2\u20ac\u201dLight scattering and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL), in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153L\u00e2\u20ac\u009d geometry (at 90\u00c2\u00b0 in relation to excitation light). [2] Aggregation was followed as a function of light scattering (excitation 320 nm, emission 320 nm). [3] For the aggregation kinetic assays, the peptides previously unfolded in a 5 or 6 m urea solution at pH 4.0 or 5.0 were diluted in buffer and light scattering was monitored as a function of time. [4] Maximum light scattering obtained from each kinetic trace was measured and normalized considering control as 100% aggregation. [5] The tryptophan fluorescence of rPrP (23\u00e2\u20ac\u201c231) and of the peptide PrP (109\u00e2\u20ac\u201c149) was measured by exciting at 280 nm and the emission verified from 300 to 420 nm. [6] bis-ANS, ANS, and AmNS were excited at 360 nm, and fluorescence emission was collected from 400 to 600 nm for bis-ANS and from 400 to 650 nm for ANS and AmNS. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturing agent to unfold peptides prior to monitoring their aggregation through light scattering measurements. The light scattering technique is employed to assess the extent of aggregation of the peptides in solution, indicating a direct relationship where urea influences the aggregation behavior observed via light scattering. This suggests that urea plays a critical role in the experimental setup for analyzing peptide aggregation dynamics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and light scattering, as urea is directly involved in the experimental process that utilizes light scattering to measure peptide aggregation. The context provides evidence of this relationship through the methodology described.",
