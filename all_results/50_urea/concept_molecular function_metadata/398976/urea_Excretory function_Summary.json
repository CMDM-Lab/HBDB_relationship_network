    "context": " [6] Of six tissues examined (gill, liver, red blood cells, kidney, skin and intestine), only gill showed expression of tUT mRNA, with a predominant band at 1.8 kb and a minor band at 3.5 kb.  [7] During several points in the urea pulse cycle of toadfish (0, 4, 6, 12 and 18 h post-pulse), measured by excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water, gill mRNA samples were obtained.  [8] Expression of tUT mRNA was found to be largely invariant relative to expression of beta-actin mRNA over the pulse cycle.  [9] These results further confirm the gill localization of urea transport in the toadfish and suggest that tUT regulation (and the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion) is probably not at the level of mRNA control. [10] The results are discussed in the context of the mechanisms of vasopressin-regulated UT-A in mammalian kidney and morphological data for the toadfish gill. [1] Objective. [2] The noninvasive13C-urea breath test (UBT) is a reliable diagnostic method for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in children, and it avoids invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the excretory function as it is measured through the excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water by toadfish. The study highlights the role of gill mRNA in urea transport, indicating that the gill is a key site for urea excretion. This suggests that urea plays a critical role in the excretory processes of the toadfish, particularly in relation to its regulation and transport mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and excretory function, as the study provides evidence of urea transport and excretion mechanisms in toadfish, indicating a clear physiological relationship.",
        "score": 4
