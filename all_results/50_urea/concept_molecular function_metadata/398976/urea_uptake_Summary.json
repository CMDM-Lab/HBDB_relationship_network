    "context": " [1] Urea excretion by the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) has been shown in previous studies to be a highly pulsatile facilitated transport, with excretion probably occurring at the gill.  [2] The present study reports the isolation of an 1800 base pair (kb) cDNA from toadfish gill with one open reading frame putatively encoding a 475-residue protein, the toadfish urea transporter (tUT).  [3] tUT, the first teleostean urea transporter cloned, has high homology with UTs (facilitated urea transporters) cloned from mammals, an amphibian and a shark, and most closely resembles the UT-A subfamily.  [4] When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, tUT increased urea permeability (as measured by [(14)C]urea uptake) five- to sevenfold, and this permeability increase was abolished by phloretin, a common inhibitor of other UTs.  [5] Northern analysis using the 1.8 kb clone was performed to determine the tissue distribution and dynamics of tUT mRNA expression.  [6] Of six tissues examined (gill, liver, red blood cells, kidney, skin and intestine), only gill showed expression of tUT mRNA, with a predominant band at 1.8 kb and a minor band at 3.5 kb.  [7] During several points in the urea pulse cycle of toadfish (0, 4, 6, 12 and 18 h post-pulse), measured by excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water, gill mRNA samples were obtained. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and uptake are directly related through the function of the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which significantly enhances urea permeability in Xenopus laevis oocytes, increasing [(14)C]urea uptake by five- to sevenfold. This indicates that tUT facilitates the uptake of urea, demonstrating a clear and critical relationship between the transporter and urea transport mechanisms in the gill of the toadfish.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the study provides direct evidence of the urea transporter\u2019s role in enhancing urea uptake, establishing a critical functional relationship between urea and its transport mechanism.",
        "score": 5
