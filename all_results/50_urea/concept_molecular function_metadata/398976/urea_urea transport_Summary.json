    "context": " [6] Of six tissues examined (gill, liver, red blood cells, kidney, skin and intestine), only gill showed expression of tUT mRNA, with a predominant band at 1.8 kb and a minor band at 3.5 kb.  [7] During several points in the urea pulse cycle of toadfish (0, 4, 6, 12 and 18 h post-pulse), measured by excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water, gill mRNA samples were obtained.  [8] Expression of tUT mRNA was found to be largely invariant relative to expression of beta-actin mRNA over the pulse cycle.  [9] These results further confirm the gill localization of urea transport in the toadfish and suggest that tUT regulation (and the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion) is probably not at the level of mRNA control. [10] The results are discussed in the context of the mechanisms of vasopressin-regulated UT-A in mammalian kidney and morphological data for the toadfish gill. [1] Objective. [2] The noninvasive13C-urea breath test (UBT) is a reliable diagnostic method for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in children, and it avoids invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea and urea transport are closely related through the study of urea excretion mechanisms in toadfish. The expression of tUT mRNA in the gill indicates that this tissue is responsible for urea transport, confirming its role in regulating urea levels in the organism. The findings suggest that the regulation of urea transport is not primarily controlled at the mRNA level, highlighting the importance of urea transport in physiological processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between urea and urea transport, as the study directly investigates the mechanisms of urea transport in toadfish gills, providing clear evidence of their critical relationship in physiological regulation.",
