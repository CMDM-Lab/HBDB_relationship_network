    "context": " [6] Of six tissues examined (gill, liver, red blood cells, kidney, skin and intestine), only gill showed expression of tUT mRNA, with a predominant band at 1.8 kb and a minor band at 3.5 kb.  [7] During several points in the urea pulse cycle of toadfish (0, 4, 6, 12 and 18 h post-pulse), measured by excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water, gill mRNA samples were obtained.  [8] Expression of tUT mRNA was found to be largely invariant relative to expression of beta-actin mRNA over the pulse cycle.  [9] These results further confirm the gill localization of urea transport in the toadfish and suggest that tUT regulation (and the regulation of pulsatile urea excretion) is probably not at the level of mRNA control. [10] The results are discussed in the context of the mechanisms of vasopressin-regulated UT-A in mammalian kidney and morphological data for the toadfish gill. [1] Objective. [2] The noninvasive13C-urea breath test (UBT) is a reliable diagnostic method for detection of Helicobacter pylori infection in children, and it avoids invasive gastrointestinal endoscopy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to its transport and regulation in the gill of toadfish. The study indicates that the expression of tUT mRNA, responsible for urea transport, does not vary significantly during the urea pulse cycle, suggesting that the regulation of urea excretion is not primarily controlled at the mRNA level. This highlights a specific regulatory mechanism for urea transport in aquatic organisms, contrasting with known mechanisms in mammalian kidneys.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and its regulation, as the study provides evidence of urea transport mechanisms and suggests regulatory processes, although it does not delve deeply into the molecular details of regulation.",
        "score": 4
