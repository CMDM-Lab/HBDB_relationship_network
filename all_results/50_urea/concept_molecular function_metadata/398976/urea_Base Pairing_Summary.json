    "context": "[4] Nevertheless, detection of H pylori antigens in the stool is likely to drive researchers with new determination to culture the organism from faeces, and to try to characterise the form in which it exists in, or passes through the large bowel. [5] Therefore, in addition to its possible role as a diagnostic tool, the detection of stool antigens raises the possibility of genotyping the organism and thereby studying its transmission and epidemiology.  [1] Urea excretion by the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta) has been shown in previous studies to be a highly pulsatile facilitated transport, with excretion probably occurring at the gill.  [2] The present study reports the isolation of an 1800 base pair (kb) cDNA from toadfish gill with one open reading frame putatively encoding a 475-residue protein, the toadfish urea transporter (tUT).  [3] tUT, the first teleostean urea transporter cloned, has high homology with UTs (facilitated urea transporters) cloned from mammals, an amphibian and a shark, and most closely resembles the UT-A subfamily.  [4] When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, tUT increased urea permeability (as measured by [(14)C]urea uptake) five- to sevenfold, and this permeability increase was abolished by phloretin, a common inhibitor of other UTs.  [5] Northern analysis using the 1.8 kb clone was performed to determine the tissue distribution and dynamics of tUT mRNA expression. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to the urea transporter (tUT) isolated from the gulf toadfish, which is encoded by a cDNA of 1800 base pairs. The study focuses on the functional characteristics of tUT and its role in urea excretion, but there is no direct connection to the concept of base pairing, which pertains to the specific interactions between nucleotides in DNA or RNA. Thus, while both terms are mentioned, their relationship is not established within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between urea and base pairing, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any discussion of their interaction or relationship.",
