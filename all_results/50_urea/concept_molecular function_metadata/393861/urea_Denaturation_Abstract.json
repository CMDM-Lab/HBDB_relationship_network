    "context": " [2] In the presence of thiol initiator and denaturant, the native LCI denatures by shuffling its native disulfide bonds and transforms into a mixture of scrambled species.  [3] 9 of 104 possible scrambled isomers of LCI, amounting to 90% of total denatured LCI, can be distinguished.  [4] The denaturation curve that plots the fraction of native LCI converted into scrambled isomers upon increasing concentrations of denaturant shows that the concentration of guanidine thiocyanate and guanidine hydrochloride required to reach 50% of denaturation is 2.4 and 3.6 m, respectively.  [5] In contrast, native LCI is resistant to urea denaturation even at high concentration (8 m).  [6] The LCI unfolding pathway was defined based on the evolution of the relative concentration of scrambled isoforms of LCI upon denaturation.  [7] Two populations of scrambled species suffer variations along the unfolding pathway.  [8] One accumulates as intermediates under strong denaturing conditions and corresponds to open or relaxed structures, among which the beads-form isomer is found. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant in the study of the denaturation process of LCI (lysozyme). The text indicates that native LCI is resistant to denaturation by urea even at high concentrations (8 m), suggesting that urea does not effectively induce denaturation in this protein. This highlights a specific relationship where urea's role as a denaturant is contrasted with its ineffectiveness in denaturing LCI, emphasizing the unique stability of this protein against urea-induced denaturation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between urea and denaturation, as the context provides evidence of urea's role as a denaturant and its specific ineffectiveness in denaturing LCI, indicating a clear relationship within the biochemical context.",
        "score": 4
