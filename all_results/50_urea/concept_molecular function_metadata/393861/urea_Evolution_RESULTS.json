    "context": "[3] The same result was found when applying a standard heat denaturation procedure. [4] Even at 65\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C with an incubation time of 1 h, no conversion of native LCI into denatured species was observed, supporting a previous observation of resonances related to the presence of three-dimensional structure by NMR at high temperatures .  [1] The pathway of LCI unfolding can be represented by plotting the relative concentrations of the scrambled isoforms of denatured LCI along the process.  [2] The data corresponding to the evolution of the nine scrambled LCI isomers in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl and GdnSCN are shown in Fig. 4. Because of the almost complete inability of urea to unfold LCI, the unfolding curves are not shown for this condition.  [3] The relative concentrations of X-LCI-a and X-LCI-b correlate with the strength of the denaturing conditions in both cases.  [4] This phenomenon is more easily observed in GdnSCN curves where an increase in the relative concentration of X-LCI-a from 10 to 45% is observed within the interval of 2\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6 m GdnSCN, while an increase from 15 to 37% is observed within the interval of 3\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6m GdnHCl.  [5] To a lower extent X-LCI-b shows the same phenomenon. ",

        "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to its inability to unfold the protein LCI under denaturing conditions. The term 'evolution' refers to the progression of the unfolding process of LCI as it interacts with different denaturants. However, there is no direct discussion of evolutionary processes or implications related to urea itself, making the connection weak.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect relationship, as urea is involved in the unfolding process of LCI, but there is no detailed discussion of its evolutionary significance or role in biological evolution.",
