    "context": "The adsorption behavior of MTBE in natural water is expected to be different from that in deionized water. So far, there has been much less investigation in the competition between MTBE and NOM for the adsorption on carbonaceous resins and zeolite. Additionally, the adsorption kinetics of MTBE on the adsorbents in both deionized water and natural water has been scarcely investigated. To evaluate the effectiveness of adsorption processes on the removal of MTBE-contaminated water, kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of MTBE onto two carbonaceous resins, Ambersorb 563, 572, and one zeolite, mordenite, in both deionized water and natural waters were elucidated in this study. Both kinetic and equilibrium experiments for MTBE onto the adsorbents were conducted. The data were then interpreted with appropriate equilibrium and kinetic models. Deionized water and natural waters Deionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q ultra-pure-water purification system (Bedford, MA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its adsorption behavior in various water types, specifically focusing on the effectiveness of adsorption processes for removing MTBE from contaminated water. The study evaluates the kinetics and equilibrium of MTBE adsorption onto different adsorbents, indicating a direct relationship between the chemical's behavior and the adsorption process being investigated. However, the term 'Process' is used generically to refer to the adsorption methods without specific details on how MTBE interacts with the process itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the adsorption process related to MTBE, indicating a connection between the chemical and the process. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of how 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane specifically influences or is influenced by the adsorption process.",
