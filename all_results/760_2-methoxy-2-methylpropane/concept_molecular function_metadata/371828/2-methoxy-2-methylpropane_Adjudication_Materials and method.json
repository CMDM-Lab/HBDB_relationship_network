    "context": "In the SPME process, a 75\u03bcm PDMS/Carboxen commercial fiber (Supelco, USA) was immersed into the water samples to extract MTBE. During the extraction, the temperature was controlled at 18\u00b0C. The sample volume was 1.6mL with addition of 25% (w/v) sodium chloride, and the extraction time was set at 60min. The extracted fiber was injected into a GC (6890 Plus, Agilent, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector for the determination of MTBE concentration. The detection limit of the method was determined to be 0.5\u03bcg/L.Adsorption experiments The adsorption capacity of MTBE in deionized water and natural water was measured by the bottle-point technology. In the equilibrium experiments, the sizes of resins were used as received (0.297\u20130.841mm, or 20\u201350US mesh), while that of F400 carbon were pulverized and sieved to 0.037\u20130.149mm (100\u2013400US mesh) to ensure equilibrium status.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not mentioned, nor is there any discussion of adjudication. The focus is on the extraction and analysis of MTBE using SPME and GC techniques, with no direct or indirect relationship established between the two terms. They appear unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and adjudication are not discussed together or related in any meaningful way in the context. They are simply absent from any relevant interaction or connection.",
