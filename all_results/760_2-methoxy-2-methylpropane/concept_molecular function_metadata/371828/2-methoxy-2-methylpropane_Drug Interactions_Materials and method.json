    "context": "To assure equilibrium status, the experimental time of all the adsorbents used was set at 5 days. The procedures of kinetic experiment were almost the same as those of the equilibrium experiment except that more samples were taken and analyzed. The bottles were stirred magnetically at 450rpm to reduce the liquid-phase resistance between the adsorbent and bulk solution. Blank experiments showed that MTBE concentration remained nearly constant (less than 2% of difference) during the time scale of the experimental period, revealing that the volatility of MTBE and its interaction with the bottles can be neglected. The samples of the carbonaceous resins and activated carbon, and mordenite were filtrated with 0.45 and 0.20\u03bcm filter (Advantec MFS, Japan), respectively, before analysis. All the experiments were conducted in a temperature-controlled chamber at 20\u00b0C. Adsorption isotherms in deionized water The MTBE isotherms for the carbonaceous resins (Ambersorb 563 and 572), and mordenite in deionized water are shown in Fig. 1 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is mentioned in relation to adsorption experiments, but there is no direct discussion of its role in drug interactions. The focus is primarily on the physical properties and behavior of MTBE in adsorption processes rather than its pharmacological implications or interactions with drugs. Therefore, the relationship between MTBE and drug interactions is not established or explored in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relevance, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in the context of adsorption experiments without any discussion or evidence of its involvement in drug interactions.",
