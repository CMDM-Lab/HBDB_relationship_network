    "context": "In contrast, when comparing the indoor and outdoor air concentrations, the proportions differed for both the low and high floors. In particular, the ratio of m,o-xylene to ethylbenzene was higher at 2.8 in the indoor air for both the low and high floors, yet only 1.4 and 1.3 in the outdoor air for the low and high floors, respectively. The higher ratios for the indoor levels appeared to result mainly from the presence of indoor m,o-xylene sources, such as smoking and consumer products employing solvents (Wallace et al., 1989).Comparison of daytime and nighttime concentrations The daytime and nighttime median concentrations measured in the high-rise apartment buildings are shown in Table 2 . The outdoor air concentrations of the three most volatile target compounds (MTBE, benzene, and toluene) differed significantly between the daytime and nighttime data sets for both low- and high-floor apartments (P<0.05). For the low-floor apartments, the median concentrations of the three VOCs for the nighttime samples (MTBE, 6.1\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 7.7\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 36.9\u03bcg/m3) were consistently 1.2\u20131.4 times higher than those for the daytime samples (MTBE, 4.5\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 6.2\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 25.9\u03bcg/m3). For the high-floor apartments, the median concentrations of the three VOCs for the nighttime samples (MTBE, 5.1\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 4.8\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 24.8\u03bcg/m3) were consistently 1.3\u20131.4 ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) among other substances like m,o-xylene, ethylbenzene, MTBE, benzene, and toluene. The discussion focuses on the concentrations of various VOCs in indoor versus outdoor air, highlighting the presence of these substances in consumer products and their varying levels based on time of day. However, there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the broader category of volatile substances.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is categorized as a volatile substance, but the context does not provide a detailed discussion of its specific role or interactions with other VOCs.",
