    "context": "4.1.3 MTBE MTBE biodegradation was by far not as effective as benzene biodegradation. MTBE is more resistant to enzymatic attacks due to its tertiary carbon atom and the ether bond (Davidson and Creek, 2000). However, an MTBE-degrading \u03b2-proteobacterium strain L108, capable of growing on fuel oxygenate ethers as the sole source of carbon and energy, was previously isolated from the Leuna site (Rohwerder et\u00a0al., 2006) and demonstrates a natural attenuation potential for MTBE at this location. Volatilization analyses showed that 48\u201353% of the removed MTBE was stripped. The residual amount might be biodegraded, although biodegradation could not be demonstrated in vitro during the first 6 months of system operation. However, from August \u201808, the coconut textile basin showed increasing MTBE removal rates of up to 67% in December \u201808 (Fig.\u00a04). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to the concept of attenuation through the discussion of MTBE biodegradation. The text highlights the natural attenuation potential of an MTBE-degrading \u03b2-proteobacterium strain, which suggests that the degradation process may involve similar mechanisms applicable to other ether compounds like 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane. However, the specific relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and attenuation is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms relate to biodegradation processes, but there is no direct evidence or detailed discussion linking 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane specifically to attenuation in the context provided.",
