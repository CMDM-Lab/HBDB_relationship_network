    "context": "Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, the three xylene isomers (m-, o-, and p-xylene, BTEX compounds) and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) are highly soluble and therefore extremely mobile in groundwater systems (Squillace et\u00a0al., 1996). Therefore, these compounds are of environmental concern and represent suitable organic contaminants for testing groundwater remediation system effectiveness. Benzene, the most toxic and water soluble BTEX compound, can be degraded by many microorganisms under oxic (Agteren et\u00a0al., 1998) and even hypoxic conditions (Yerushalmi et\u00a0al., 2002). MTBE biodegradation is slow and difficult due to steric effects within the molecule, but has been shown by several studies to be degraded under aerobic conditions (Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2006; Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2004). Notably, growth rates and biomass yields for aerobic MTBE degraders have been shown to be much lower than aerobic benzene degraders (Fortin et\u00a0al., 2001). Both MTBE and benzene are highly recalcitrant under anoxic conditions (Foght, 2008; H\u00e4ggblom et\u00a0al., 2007). Ammonium can be aerobically oxidized to nitrate by slow growing microorganisms in a two-step process known as nitrification. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly discussed in relation to stereochemistry. The focus is primarily on the environmental behavior and biodegradation of various organic compounds, including BTEX and MTBE, without any mention of stereochemical aspects or specific interactions involving 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane. Thus, the relationship between the two terms is not established.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful connection between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and stereochemistry in the provided context. They are mentioned separately without any discussion of their relationship or relevance.",
