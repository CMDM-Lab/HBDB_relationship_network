    "context": "An inhibition of MTBE biodegradation in the presence of BTEX due to a potential production of by-products has also been suggested by others (Deeb et\u00a0al., 2001; Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). These studies have focused mainly on substrate inhibition (Park, 1999), by-product inhibition (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2002) or competitive inhibition (Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). Therefore, the presence of BTEX compounds in the groundwater of the refinery site was expected to inhibit MTBE biodegradation in both the RF and PF systems. But these inhibitory effects on MTBE biodegradation could not be observed in both the filters during this study. Table 4 shows the presence of BTEX and other aromatic hydrocarbons in the influent groundwater with a mean concentration value and still a highly efficient MTBE-concentration reduction (93\u201398%) can be seen especially in the effluent of the PF during single-stage operation (Table 3). However, very little is known about the microbial community structure during the aerobic MTBE degradation in the presence of BTEX. The disappearance of MTBE metabolites, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF) indicated the potential of complete biodegradation within the filter systems. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its biodegradation, which is potentially inhibited by the presence of BTEX compounds. While the studies referenced suggest various forms of inhibition (substrate, by-product, and competitive), the specific inhibitory effects on MTBE biodegradation were not observed in the filters during the study. This indicates a complex relationship where inhibitors may not always lead to expected outcomes in biodegradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the potential inhibitory effects of BTEX on MTBE biodegradation, indicating a relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and inhibitors, but without strong evidence of direct interaction or significant impact.",
        "score": 3
