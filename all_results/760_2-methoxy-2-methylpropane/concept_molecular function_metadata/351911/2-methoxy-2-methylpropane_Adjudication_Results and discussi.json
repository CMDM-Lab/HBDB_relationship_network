    "context": "All analytes show stable responses after 50 cycles, meaning that additional cycles do not further increase peak areas. However, the differences in individual extraction profiles are relatively high, especially for the first 10 aspiration cycles. Since with the chosen experimental settings, a laminar flow in the needle is obtained (Reynolds number Re of around 22), the equilibration time increases linearly with the sorbent-air partitioning coefficient K sa  . The rapid equilibration for MTBE compared with the low chain alcohols shown in Fig. 5 thus seems to be caused by a rather low K sa value.Addition of salt and determination of Setschenow constants The influence of electrolyte addition (sodium chloride) to the sample solution on extraction yield was tested by using 50 extraction cycles and an extraction temperature of 70\u00b0C. Five different concentration levels from 0 to 25% NaCl (w/w) were used. Higher concentration levels were not used because of (i) approaching the sodium chloride water solubility and inadequately long dissolving times, and (ii) previous reports of decreased sensitivities for MTBE and no substantial increase in sensitivity for ethanol, tert-butanol and isopropanol for salt concentrations above 25% (w/w). The addition of salt increases the sample volume and therefore volume correction factors were determined experimentally for the tested salt concentrations and applied in all subsequent calculations.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to extraction processes and the influence of sodium chloride on extraction yields. However, there is no direct connection or relevance to the term 'Adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. The two terms appear in the same context but do not interact or relate to each other in any meaningful way.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and Adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance.",
