    "context": "Accordingly, several studies (SCAQMD, 1989; Chan et al., 1991a,b; Weisel et al., 1992; Dor et al., 1995; Lawryk and Weisel, 1996; Rodes et al., 1998; Jo and Park, 1998, 1999) have identified that individuals inside vehicles are exposed to elevated levels of five to 24 VOCs when compared with the corresponding ambient air at nearby monitoring sites. These elevated levels result from the penetration of gasoline-derived VOCs from roadway air plus in-vehicle evaporative emissions in the case of passenger cars. Recently, methyl-tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), benzene and toluene have received significant attention in relation to in-vehicle exposure (Lioy et al., 1994; Jo and Park, 1998). In the United States, MTBE is added to gasoline to reduce the motor vehicle exhaust emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and increase octane ratings (Anderson, 1993; Stump et al., 1994; Kirchstetter et al., 1996; Mannino and Etzel, 1996). The addition of MTBE to gasoline reduces the carbon monoxide concentrations by between 10 and 15% (Anderson, 1993). However, the addition of MTBE can elevate the in-vehicle MTBE levels, thereby increasing the vehicle occupants\u2019 exposure to this compound (Lioy et al., 1994). Exposure to this compound is of particular concern because of its toxicity and is potentially linked to ailments such as headaches, dizziness, irritated eyes and nausea (Clean Air Act, 1990; State of Alaska, 1992; Mehlman, 1996, 1998; Bevan et al., 1997; Bird et al., 1997).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that individuals may be exposed to in vehicles due to gasoline emissions. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding amputation stumps, making it unclear how these two terms relate to each other. The mention of amputation stumps does not provide any context linking them to the exposure or effects of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and amputation stumps, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance.",
