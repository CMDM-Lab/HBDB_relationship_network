    "context": "Due to the widespread use of fuels, BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-, o-, and p-xylene) and MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) are frequently detected groundwater contaminants, with releases occurring during their production, transportation and storage (Baehr et\u00a0al., 1999; Deeb et\u00a0al., 2000; Squillace et\u00a0al., 1996). MTBE has received considerable attention in recent times as it migrates much more quickly through the soil than most of the petroleum distillates due to its high water solubility (up to 51\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121, USEPA, 2004). Its presence in the environment is considered as a health and drinking water problem and classifies MTBE as a possible human carcinogen (Johnson et\u00a0al., 2000). MTBE is relatively resistant to biological degradation under anaerobic conditions (Moreels et\u00a0al., 2006), but several studies have shown a biodegradability under aerobic conditions (Deeb et\u00a0al., 2000; Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2006; Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2004). Benzene is carcinogenic and the most water soluble BTEX compound. It can also be degraded by many microorganisms under aerobic conditions (Yerushalmi et\u00a0al., 2002). The present limit concentrations established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the German guideline value are 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 for MTBE and 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 for benzene in drinking water (USEPA, 2005; DVGW, 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly related to Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular. The passage discusses environmental contaminants, particularly BTEX compounds and MTBE, focusing on their health implications and biodegradability. There is no mention of autoimmune conditions or any connection to 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, indicating a lack of relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their relationship or relevance to each other.",
