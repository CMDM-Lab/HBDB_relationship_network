    "context": "Thus, the higher in-vehicle levels in the present study would appear to be due to the elevated proportion of toluene (50% by volume) in the spurious gasoline sold during the experiment periods of the present study. Although information on the exact amount is unavailable, the Korean news media reported that some spurious gasoline was sold illegally during the experimental periods of the present study. The present study evaluated in-vehicle exposure to MTBE, benzene and toluene on actual commuting routes, focusing on four potentially influencing factors (transportation mode, passenger-car type, commute period and commute season). The transportation mode, passenger-car type and commute season were all found to influence the in-vehicle MTBE and two aromatic compound levels. However, the commuting period had little effect on the in-vehicle levels of the three compounds. The current study confirmed that under Korean commute conditions, vehicle interiors are an important microenvironment for exposure to the target compounds. This is also supported by the finding that in-car and in-bus air levels tend to be much higher than ambient air levels, as reported in another unpublished study conducted in the same study city by the current authors.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly discussed in relation to aromatic compounds like toluene and benzene, which are highlighted as significant components of in-vehicle exposure. The study focuses on the levels of these aromatic compounds in the vehicle environment, while 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not mentioned as a relevant aromatic compound or in any specific interaction with them. Thus, their relationship is not established within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and aromatic compounds, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their interaction or significance together.",
