    "context": "Accordingly, several studies (SCAQMD, 1989; Chan et al., 1991a,b; Weisel et al., 1992; Dor et al., 1995; Lawryk and Weisel, 1996; Rodes et al., 1998; Jo and Park, 1998, 1999) have identified that individuals inside vehicles are exposed to elevated levels of five to 24 VOCs when compared with the corresponding ambient air at nearby monitoring sites. These elevated levels result from the penetration of gasoline-derived VOCs from roadway air plus in-vehicle evaporative emissions in the case of passenger cars. Recently, methyl-tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), benzene and toluene have received significant attention in relation to in-vehicle exposure (Lioy et al., 1994; Jo and Park, 1998). In the United States, MTBE is added to gasoline to reduce the motor vehicle exhaust emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and increase octane ratings (Anderson, 1993; Stump et al., 1994; Kirchstetter et al., 1996; Mannino and Etzel, 1996). The addition of MTBE to gasoline reduces the carbon monoxide concentrations by between 10 and 15% (Anderson, 1993). However, the addition of MTBE can elevate the in-vehicle MTBE levels, thereby increasing the vehicle occupants\u2019 exposure to this compound (Lioy et al., 1994). Exposure to this compound is of particular concern because of its toxicity and is potentially linked to ailments such as headaches, dizziness, irritated eyes and nausea (Clean Air Act, 1990; State of Alaska, 1992; Mehlman, 1996, 1998; Bevan et al., 1997; Bird et al., 1997).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and octane are both mentioned in relation to gasoline and its components. Octane is highlighted as a factor in increasing gasoline's performance, while 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly linked to octane but is implied to be part of the broader discussion on VOCs in vehicle emissions. Their relationship is indirect, as both are associated with gasoline but not specifically connected in terms of chemical interaction or functional relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and octane, as they are both components related to gasoline and VOC exposure. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or roles within the context provided.",
