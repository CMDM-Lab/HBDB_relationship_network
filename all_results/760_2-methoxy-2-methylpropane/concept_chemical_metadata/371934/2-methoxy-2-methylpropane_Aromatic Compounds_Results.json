    "context": "However, the multivariate analysis showed that there were interaction effects on the in-vehicle concentrations between transportation mode and season, indicating that the concentration difference between the two transportation modes would vary by season.Comparison of concentration levels according to passenger car type Table 3 shows the median in-vehicle VOC concentrations measured inside the passenger cars based on the car size and model year. Information on the passenger cars and car type is shown in Table 1. A statistical model (four-way general linear model) showed no significant interaction among the four variables tested in this study (model year, car size, season and commute period). However, the statistical model and non-parametric Wilcoxon test both showed a significant difference in the in-vehicle levels of MTBE and the two aromatic compounds (benzene and toluene) relative to the model year, though not the car size. The criterion for significance in the procedures was P<0.05. The median concentration ratios of older to newer cars ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 for the small-sized cars and from 1.2 to 1.5 for the large-sized cars, depending on the compound.Comparison of concentration levels according to commute period The in-vehicle concentrations measured during morning and evening commutes were compared. The in-vehicle concentrations according to the commute period are summarized in Table 4 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned alongside aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene in a study analyzing in-vehicle VOC concentrations. However, there is no direct discussion of the relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the aromatic compounds. The focus is primarily on the statistical differences in VOC levels based on car model year and commute periods, without detailing how 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane interacts with or relates to the aromatic compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and aromatic compounds are part of the broader category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in the study, but their specific relationship is not explored.",
