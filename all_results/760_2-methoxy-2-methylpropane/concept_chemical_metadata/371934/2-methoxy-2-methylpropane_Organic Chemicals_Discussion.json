    "context": "Non-parametric and multivariate tests showed that the in-vehicle concentrations were significantly different between winter and summer commutes for both transportation modes (P<0.05). All three target compounds showed the same statistical result. The winter to summer ratios of the median concentrations ranged from 1.4 to 1.6 for the passenger cars and 1.2\u20131.5 for the public buses, depending on the compound. This study evaluated the in-vehicle exposure of passenger car and public bus commuters to MTBE and two other important markers of vehicle emissions (benzene and toluene) while traveling on actual commute routes, not hypothetical routes as used in many previous in-vehicle exposure studies of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Four potentially influencing factors (transportation mode, passenger car-type, commute period, and commute season) were focused on. The in-vehicle concentrations of the three target compounds (MTBE, benzene, and toluene) were significantly higher in the passenger cars than in the public buses, indicating that commuters in passenger cars are exposed to elevated levels of the target compounds compared with commuters on public buses during the same traveling time. This finding is consistent with that of Jo and Park (1998) for MTBE and benzene, even though different survey protocols were employed in the two studies. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a specific organic chemical among other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like MTBE, benzene, and toluene. The study focuses on the in-vehicle exposure of commuters to these organic chemicals, highlighting their varying concentrations based on transportation mode and season. However, the relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the broader category of organic chemicals is not explicitly detailed beyond its classification as a VOC.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is categorized as an organic chemical, but the context does not provide specific interactions or detailed relevance between this compound and the broader category of organic chemicals.",
