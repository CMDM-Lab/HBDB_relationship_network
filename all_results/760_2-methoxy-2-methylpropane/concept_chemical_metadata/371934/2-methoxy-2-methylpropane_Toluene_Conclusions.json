    "context": "Moreover, according to the Korean Petroleum Corporation, there was only a minimal variation in the proportions of the gasoline constituents including the three target compounds between the experimental periods of the two studies. Thus, the higher in-vehicle levels in the present study would appear to be due to the elevated proportion of toluene (50% by volume) in the spurious gasoline sold during the experiment periods of the present study. Although information on the exact amount is unavailable, the Korean news media reported that some spurious gasoline was sold illegally during the experimental periods of the present study. The present study evaluated in-vehicle exposure to MTBE, benzene and toluene on actual commuting routes, focusing on four potentially influencing factors (transportation mode, passenger-car type, commute period and commute season). The transportation mode, passenger-car type and commute season were all found to influence the in-vehicle MTBE and two aromatic compound levels. However, the commuting period had little effect on the in-vehicle levels of the three compounds. The current study confirmed that under Korean commute conditions, vehicle interiors are an important microenvironment for exposure to the target compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as constituents of gasoline, with toluene being highlighted for its significant proportion (50% by volume) in spurious gasoline. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly discussed, and they are primarily referenced in the context of exposure levels during commuting. There is no direct interaction or comparison provided between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the gasoline constituents being studied for in-vehicle exposure. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or interaction, limiting the relevance.",
