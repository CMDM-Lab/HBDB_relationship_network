    "context": "Meanwhile, benzene is a known carcinogen such as leukemia (IARC, 1987; USEPA, 1990). Toluene is neurotoxic (Amess, 1995; Liu and Fechter, 1997). According to the Korean Petroleum Corporation, the gasoline manufactured by all five Korean petroleum companies contains 6\u20138% MTBE, 1\u20133% benzene and 10\u201312% toluene by volume. This study was conducted to examine the in-vehicle exposure of passenger car and public bus commuters to MTBE, benzene and toluene in Taegu, Korea, while focusing on four factors (transportation mode, passenger-car type, commute period and commute season) that may influence the amount of in-vehicle exposure. Unlike the previous in-vehicle VOC exposure studies, the present investigation was conducted using actual commute routes. According to the Korean news media, some spurious gasoline, typically manufactured by mixing toluene with the solvent used in paint manufacturing (50/50 by volume), was being illegally sold in the study area. As such, the use of the spurious gasoline by some vehicles may have increased the toluene levels in the roadway air and in-vehicle evaporative emissions, thereby affecting the in-vehicle toluene exposure levels.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as components of gasoline and solvents, with toluene specifically noted for its neurotoxic effects. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not directly discussed, and they are primarily referenced in the context of exposure studies related to gasoline emissions. Their connection is more about their presence in similar environments rather than any specific interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are mentioned in the context of gasoline and exposure studies, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
