    "context": "This controversy surrounding the issue thus implies the need for further studies on MTBE exposure and its related health effects. Meanwhile, benzene is a known carcinogen such as leukemia (IARC, 1987; USEPA, 1990). Toluene is neurotoxic (Amess, 1995; Liu and Fechter, 1997). According to the Korean Petroleum Corporation, the gasoline manufactured by all five Korean petroleum companies contains 6\u20138% MTBE, 1\u20133% benzene and 10\u201312% toluene by volume. This study was conducted to examine the in-vehicle exposure of passenger car and public bus commuters to MTBE, benzene and toluene in Taegu, Korea, while focusing on four factors (transportation mode, passenger-car type, commute period and commute season) that may influence the amount of in-vehicle exposure. Unlike the previous in-vehicle VOC exposure studies, the present investigation was conducted using actual commute routes. According to the Korean news media, some spurious gasoline, typically manufactured by mixing toluene with the solvent used in paint manufacturing (50/50 by volume), was being illegally sold in the study area.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is mentioned as a component of gasoline produced by petroleum companies, which also contains other volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene. The study focuses on the exposure to these compounds during commutes, indicating that MTBE is derived from petroleum products, but does not elaborate on any specific health effects or interactions between MTBE and petroleum beyond their association in gasoline formulations.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is included in the context of petroleum-derived gasoline. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions, limiting the relevance.",
