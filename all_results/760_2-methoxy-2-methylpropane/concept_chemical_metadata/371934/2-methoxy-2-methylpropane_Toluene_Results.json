    "context": "However, the multivariate analysis showed that there were interaction effects on the in-vehicle concentrations between transportation mode and season, indicating that the concentration difference between the two transportation modes would vary by season.Comparison of concentration levels according to passenger car type Table 3 shows the median in-vehicle VOC concentrations measured inside the passenger cars based on the car size and model year. Information on the passenger cars and car type is shown in Table 1. A statistical model (four-way general linear model) showed no significant interaction among the four variables tested in this study (model year, car size, season and commute period). However, the statistical model and non-parametric Wilcoxon test both showed a significant difference in the in-vehicle levels of MTBE and the two aromatic compounds (benzene and toluene) relative to the model year, though not the car size. The criterion for significance in the procedures was P<0.05. The median concentration ratios of older to newer cars ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 for the small-sized cars and from 1.2 to 1.5 for the large-sized cars, depending on the compound.Comparison of concentration levels according to commute period The in-vehicle concentrations measured during morning and evening commutes were compared. The in-vehicle concentrations according to the commute period are summarized in Table 4 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in passenger cars. However, the analysis focuses primarily on the concentration levels of toluene and other aromatic compounds in relation to car model year and size, without detailing any specific interaction or relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is more about their presence in the same study rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs measured in the same context, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other.",
