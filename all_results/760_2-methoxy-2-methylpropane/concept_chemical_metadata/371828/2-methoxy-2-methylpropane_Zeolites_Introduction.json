    "context": "The adsorption behavior of MTBE in natural water is expected to be different from that in deionized water. So far, there has been much less investigation in the competition between MTBE and NOM for the adsorption on carbonaceous resins and zeolite. Additionally, the adsorption kinetics of MTBE on the adsorbents in both deionized water and natural water has been scarcely investigated. To evaluate the effectiveness of adsorption processes on the removal of MTBE-contaminated water, kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of MTBE onto two carbonaceous resins, Ambersorb 563, 572, and one zeolite, mordenite, in both deionized water and natural waters were elucidated in this study. Both kinetic and equilibrium experiments for MTBE onto the adsorbents were conducted. The data were then interpreted with appropriate equilibrium and kinetic models. Deionized water and natural waters Deionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q ultra-pure-water purification system (Bedford, MA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its adsorption behavior on zeolites, specifically mordenite, compared to carbonaceous resins. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these adsorbents in removing MTBE from contaminated water, highlighting the role of zeolites in the adsorption process. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the adsorption characteristics rather than a direct chemical interaction between MTBE and zeolites.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the adsorption of MTBE on zeolites, indicating a specific interaction in the context of water treatment. However, the details of their relationship are not extensively explored beyond the adsorption process.",
