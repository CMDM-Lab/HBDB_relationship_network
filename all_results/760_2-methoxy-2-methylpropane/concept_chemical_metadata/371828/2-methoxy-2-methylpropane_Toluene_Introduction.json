    "context": "In particular for polar WAX phases, this is a significant improvement in comparison with SPME Carbowax coatings. Furthermore, except for MTBE, the obtained MDLs with SPDE are comparable or even better than with other injection/enrichment techniques. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is the most common oxygenated fuel additive used to increase the octane rating and to enhance the combustion efficiency of gasoline. Due to its high water solubility, slow biodegradability, low Henry's law constant, and small partition coefficient, MTBE is relatively stable and recalcitrant compared to many other gasoline components such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) in the environment [1\u20133]. Although the impacts of MTBE on human health are not well understood, it has already been listed as a possible human carcinogen. In addition to the potential health risk, the compound also produces an unpleasant odor at low concentration. The adsorption process is one of the promising techniques for the control of synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) in many environmental applications. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as components of gasoline and are discussed in relation to their environmental stability and health impacts. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between the two compounds. They are part of a broader discussion on gasoline components and their effects, particularly focusing on MTBE as a fuel additive and its comparison to other compounds like toluene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are discussed in the context of gasoline components and environmental concerns, but there is no detailed interaction or functional relationship provided between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene.",
