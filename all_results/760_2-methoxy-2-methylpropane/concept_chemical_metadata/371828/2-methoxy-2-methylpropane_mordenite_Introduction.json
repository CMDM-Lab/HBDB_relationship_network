    "context": "The adsorption behavior of MTBE in natural water is expected to be different from that in deionized water. So far, there has been much less investigation in the competition between MTBE and NOM for the adsorption on carbonaceous resins and zeolite. Additionally, the adsorption kinetics of MTBE on the adsorbents in both deionized water and natural water has been scarcely investigated. To evaluate the effectiveness of adsorption processes on the removal of MTBE-contaminated water, kinetic and equilibrium adsorption of MTBE onto two carbonaceous resins, Ambersorb 563, 572, and one zeolite, mordenite, in both deionized water and natural waters were elucidated in this study. Both kinetic and equilibrium experiments for MTBE onto the adsorbents were conducted. The data were then interpreted with appropriate equilibrium and kinetic models. Deionized water and natural waters Deionized water was prepared using a Milli-Q ultra-pure-water purification system (Bedford, MA, USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to mordenite through the study of adsorption processes for removing MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) from contaminated water. Mordenite, a type of zeolite, is one of the adsorbents evaluated for its effectiveness in adsorbing MTBE, although 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned as a subject of study. The focus is primarily on the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium of MTBE on mordenite and other carbonaceous resins.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the broader context of adsorption studies, but there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and mordenite.",
        "score": 2
