    "context": "A much faster adsorption kinetics of MTBE onto the two resins tested was observed compared to that onto the mordenite zeolite. The presence of NOM near aperture entrances of mordenite may reduce the number of transport paths for MTBE and slow the adsorption kinetics for MTBE in natural waters. Although the adsorption equilibrium was influenced by the presence of NOM, for the adsorbents tested, the IAST-EBC model successfully predicted the adsorption capacity of MTBE in natural waters under different initial concentrations. When combined the IAST-EBC model with the pore diffusion and micropore diffusion model for describing the transport of MTBE into the carbonaceous resins and mordenite zeolite, respectively, the models excellently predicted the adsorption kinetics of the resins and zeolite employed in different water matrix. This may further substantiate the applicability of the models. The proximity of a residence to urban pollution sources has already been related to high residential exposure to ambient air pollutants (Fischer et al., 2000; Gelencser et al., 1997; Jo and Moon, 1999; Shah and Singh, 1988). Nakai et al. (1995) reported that residential ambient air concentrations of NO2 in Tokyo were higher close to the roadside than they were further away from it. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) and mordenite are related through their roles in adsorption processes. The study compares the adsorption kinetics of MTBE onto mordenite zeolite and carbonaceous resins, highlighting that mordenite's performance is influenced by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). While both substances are involved in the adsorption process, the context does not provide a direct interaction or significant functional relationship between them beyond their roles as adsorbate and adsorbent.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and mordenite are involved in the adsorption process, but their relationship lacks detailed discussion or significant interaction beyond their roles in the study.",
        "score": 2
