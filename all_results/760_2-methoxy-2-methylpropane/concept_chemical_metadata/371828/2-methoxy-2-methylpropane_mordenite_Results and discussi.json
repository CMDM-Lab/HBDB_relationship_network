    "context": "The adsorption kinetic of MTBE within mordenite in FS surface water is depicted and simulated by micropore diffusion model, as shown in Fig. 7 . For comparison, Fig. 7 also includes the experimental data of MTBE in deionized water and STL groundwater from the study of Hung et al.. The Freundlich isotherm in deionized water was directly used in the model. The models were able to capture the adsorption kinetics of MTBE onto mordenite for all the water matrix tested. The best-fitted intracrystalline diffusivity of MTBE in deionized water is 2.0\u00d710\u221213 cm2/s, while that in STL groundwater and FS surface water is 2.0\u00d710\u221214 and 6.0\u00d710\u221214 cm2/s, respectively. The adsorption kinetics in this case was much slower than that for the carbonaceous resins. In the case of deionized water, equilibrium time for mordenite (0.5h) is about two order of magnitudes smaller than that for the carbonaceous resins (100h). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to mordenite through the study of adsorption kinetics of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) onto mordenite. While 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not explicitly mentioned in relation to mordenite, the focus on adsorption kinetics suggests a broader investigation of how various organic compounds, potentially including 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, interact with mordenite as an adsorbent material. However, the specific relationship between the two terms is not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the context of adsorption studies, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
