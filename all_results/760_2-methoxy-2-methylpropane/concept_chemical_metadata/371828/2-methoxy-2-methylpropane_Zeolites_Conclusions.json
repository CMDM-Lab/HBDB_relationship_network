    "context": "A much faster adsorption kinetics of MTBE onto the two resins tested was observed compared to that onto the mordenite zeolite. The presence of NOM near aperture entrances of mordenite may reduce the number of transport paths for MTBE and slow the adsorption kinetics for MTBE in natural waters. Although the adsorption equilibrium was influenced by the presence of NOM, for the adsorbents tested, the IAST-EBC model successfully predicted the adsorption capacity of MTBE in natural waters under different initial concentrations. When combined the IAST-EBC model with the pore diffusion and micropore diffusion model for describing the transport of MTBE into the carbonaceous resins and mordenite zeolite, respectively, the models excellently predicted the adsorption kinetics of the resins and zeolite employed in different water matrix. This may further substantiate the applicability of the models. The proximity of a residence to urban pollution sources has already been related to high residential exposure to ambient air pollutants (Fischer et al., 2000; Gelencser et al., 1997; Jo and Moon, 1999; Shah and Singh, 1988). Nakai et al. (1995) reported that residential ambient air concentrations of NO2 in Tokyo were higher close to the roadside than they were further away from it. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its adsorption kinetics on mordenite zeolite compared to carbonaceous resins. The study highlights how the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) affects the adsorption process, indicating that zeolites like mordenite can influence the transport and adsorption behavior of MTBE in natural waters. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the adsorption characteristics rather than a direct chemical interaction between MTBE and zeolites.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the adsorption of MTBE on mordenite zeolite, indicating a specific interaction related to adsorption kinetics. However, it lacks deeper exploration of the chemical properties or broader implications of this relationship.",
