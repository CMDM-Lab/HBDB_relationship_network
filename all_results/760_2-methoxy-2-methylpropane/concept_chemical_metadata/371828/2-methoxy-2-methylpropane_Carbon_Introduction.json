    "context": "The adsorption process is one of the promising techniques for the control of synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) in many environmental applications. Granular activated carbon (GAC) is the most popular adsorbent used and the process has been shown to successfully remove MTBE from contaminated water [8\u201310]. However, poor removal efficiency may be observed in applying carbon adsorption process, especially when other SOCs co-exist with MTBE. Consequently, the carbon adsorption process may not be cost-effective for MTBE removal. The presence of natural organic matter (NOM) may also reduce the adsorption capacity and slow the kinetics while applying activated carbon in natural water. To enhance the performance of adsorption and diminish the adverse effect of NOM, different types of adsorbents, such as carbonaceous resins and mordenite zeolite, were proposed for the removal of MTBE from contaminated waters. The carbonaceous resins of Ambersorb 563 and 572 have been found to possess a superior adsorption capacity for MTBE in different water matrixes [12\u201314]. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is implied as a synthetic organic compound (SOC) that may be adsorbed using granular activated carbon (GAC). The discussion focuses on the effectiveness of carbon as an adsorbent for removing SOCs like MTBE from contaminated water, highlighting the role of carbon in the adsorption process rather than a direct relationship with 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related through the context of adsorption processes involving carbon as an adsorbent for synthetic organic compounds, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interaction.",
