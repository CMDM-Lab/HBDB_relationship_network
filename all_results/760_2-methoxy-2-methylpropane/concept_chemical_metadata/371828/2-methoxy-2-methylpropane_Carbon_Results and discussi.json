    "context": "The single-solute Freundlich parameters are listed in Table 2 . To visualize the performances of different adsorbents, the adsorption capacity of MTBE at 1\u03bcmol/L determined from the Freundlich isotherms was compared. Among the adsorbents tested, Ambersorb 563 and 572 have the highest adsorption capacity, while F400 carbon has the lowest adsorption capacity. The adsorption capacity of mordenite (30.8\u03bcmol/g) at 1\u03bcmol/L is almost twice the capacity of MTBE to that of F400 carbon (16.0\u03bcmol/g), while that of Ambersorb 563 and 572 (49.7 and 52.2\u03bcmol/g) are nearly three times that of F400 carbon. The isotherms of Ambersorb 563 and 572 are similar in the concentration range tested (0.068\u20136.8\u03bcmol/L or 6\u2013600\u03bcg/L). The parameters of Ambersorb 563 and 572 extracted (in Table 2) are slightly different from the study of Davis and Powers. This could be caused by several factors, including the artificial groundwater water matrix, and significantly higher and broader range of concentration, 600\u03bcg/L to 1000mg/L, used by Davis and Powers.Adsorption isotherms of resins in natural waters The MTBE isotherms of Ambersorb 563 in STL groundwater and FS surface water are presented in Fig. 2 .

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly related to carbon but is mentioned in the context of adsorption studies involving various adsorbents, including F400 carbon. The focus is on the adsorption capacities of different materials rather than a specific interaction between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon itself. The relationship is more about the comparison of adsorption performance rather than a chemical or functional connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the discussion of adsorption capacities, but there is no detailed interaction or significant relevance between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon in the context provided.",
