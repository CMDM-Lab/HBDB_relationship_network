    "context": "System performance for benzene was similar for both geotextiles used. 4.1.3 MTBE MTBE biodegradation was by far not as effective as benzene biodegradation. MTBE is more resistant to enzymatic attacks due to its tertiary carbon atom and the ether bond (Davidson and Creek, 2000). However, an MTBE-degrading \u03b2-proteobacterium strain L108, capable of growing on fuel oxygenate ethers as the sole source of carbon and energy, was previously isolated from the Leuna site (Rohwerder et\u00a0al., 2006) and demonstrates a natural attenuation potential for MTBE at this location. Volatilization analyses showed that 48\u201353% of the removed MTBE was stripped. The residual amount might be biodegraded, although biodegradation could not be demonstrated in vitro during the first 6 months of system operation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around MTBE, which contains a tertiary carbon atom and an ether bond. The term 'atom' is referenced in relation to the structure of MTBE, indicating that the chemical properties of MTBE are influenced by its atomic composition. However, there is no specific relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the concept of an atom beyond the general chemical context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms relate to chemical structures and properties, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
