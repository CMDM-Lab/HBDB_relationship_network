    "context": "oxygen, hydrogen, and sulphur are not considered in the biomass. Consequently, phosphorous was always detected in the outflow of the system at concentrations of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mg/L. The removal of up to 0.4\u00a0mg/L phosphorous in the system might be a result of biomass formation. However, the calculated amount of phosphorus necessary for complete degradation of benzene, MTBE and ammonium is 1.35\u00a0mg/L (see supplementary information) and indicates that phosphorus might become a growth-limiting factor during higher overall degradation rates.Investigation of biofilms and microbial community The textiles in the aerated pond system enhanced degradation rates for organic contaminates by supporting the development of contaminant-degrading biofilms. Significant biofilms were formed on both textile types, as observed by repeated CLSM-analysis of textile samples. Algae and bacteria were found along all sampling depths throughout the experimental period. However the upper portion was dominated by algae and cyanobacteria, and the middle and bottom portions by bacteria (see supplementary data). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and ammonium are mentioned in relation to the degradation of organic contaminants and the nutrient dynamics within a microbial community. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between the two terms. Ammonium is noted as a necessary component for degradation processes, while 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not explicitly linked to ammonium's role or effects in the system.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and ammonium are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or functional relationship described between them.",
