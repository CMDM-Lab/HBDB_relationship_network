    "context": "4.1.5 Phosphate Around 1.4\u00a0mg/L phosphate and 0.9\u00a0mg/L phosphorous entered the system on average. Soil microbial biomass ratios were suggested to be related to Redfield ratios of 60:7:1 for C:N:P (Cleveland and Liptzin, 2007). Based on these ratios and considering reported growth yields for benzene (Reardon et\u00a0al., 2000), MTBE (M\u00fcller et\u00a0al., 2007), ammonium, and nitrite (Ahn, 2006) of 1.2\u00a0g/g, 0.869\u00a0g/g, 0.15\u00a0g/g and 0.02\u00a0g/g, respectively, the system was not considered to be limited by phosphorous (see supplementary information). The theoretical phosphorous uptake of 0.9\u00a0mg P/L matches the inflow concentration of phosphorous and may represent an overestimation because other elements, e.g. oxygen, hydrogen, and sulphur are not considered in the biomass. Consequently, phosphorous was always detected in the outflow of the system at concentrations of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mg/L. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned or related to phosphorous. The discussion focuses on phosphorous concentrations in a system and its relationship to soil microbial biomass and growth yields of various compounds. There is no indication of how 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane interacts with or affects phosphorous levels or vice versa.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and phosphorous, as they are not discussed together in a relevant context or interaction.",
