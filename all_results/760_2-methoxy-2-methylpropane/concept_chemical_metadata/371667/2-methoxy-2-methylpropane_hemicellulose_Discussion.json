    "context": "However, in this case, both systems should have been influenced in the same manner, a result not observed. Indeed, MTBE biodegradation was confirmed by laboratory microcosm experiments performed with coconut textile samples in August \u201808, around 8 months after operation was initiated, while no biodegradation was observed for polypropylene after 100 days of incubation (Fig.\u00a05). Maximum growth rates (\u03bc max) for aerobic MTBE degraders are an order of magnitude lower than reported for BTEX and nitrifying organisms (Waul et\u00a0al., 2007), and this may have led to extensive lag-phases for MTBE degraders or even MTBE degraders being out-competed in some sections of the system. Further research is needed to determine if auxiliary substances provided by the coconut material which might consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin, waxes, and water soluble substances (Bledzki and Gassan, 1999) enhance or stimulate the growth of aerobic MTBE degraders. 4.1.4 Ammonium Ammonium concentrations decreased only slightly from an average concentration of 59\u00a0mg/L in the inflow to 56\u00a0mg/L in the outflows (Table 1), indicating inhibited or absent nitrification during the first 14 months of operation. Nitrification is a chemolithoautotrophic process that is performed in two sequential oxygen demanding steps. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly related to hemicellulose, but both are mentioned in the broader discussion of biodegradation processes. The text suggests that auxiliary substances from coconut material, which may include hemicellulose, could potentially enhance the growth of aerobic MTBE degraders. However, there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and hemicellulose.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are part of a discussion on biodegradation, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or supported by evidence in the context.",
