    "context": "oxygen, hydrogen, and sulphur are not considered in the biomass. Consequently, phosphorous was always detected in the outflow of the system at concentrations of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mg/L. The removal of up to 0.4\u00a0mg/L phosphorous in the system might be a result of biomass formation. However, the calculated amount of phosphorus necessary for complete degradation of benzene, MTBE and ammonium is 1.35\u00a0mg/L (see supplementary information) and indicates that phosphorus might become a growth-limiting factor during higher overall degradation rates.Investigation of biofilms and microbial community The textiles in the aerated pond system enhanced degradation rates for organic contaminates by supporting the development of contaminant-degrading biofilms. Significant biofilms were formed on both textile types, as observed by repeated CLSM-analysis of textile samples. Algae and bacteria were found along all sampling depths throughout the experimental period. However the upper portion was dominated by algae and cyanobacteria, and the middle and bottom portions by bacteria (see supplementary data). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around phosphorus as a potential growth-limiting factor in biomass formation during the degradation of organic contaminants. Growth factors are typically substances that promote cellular growth, but the relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and growth factors is not established or explored in detail. The focus is primarily on microbial communities and biofilm development rather than specific chemical interactions involving 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and growth factors, as the context does not provide any specific interaction or relevance between the two terms. They are mentioned in the same context but without any meaningful connection.",
