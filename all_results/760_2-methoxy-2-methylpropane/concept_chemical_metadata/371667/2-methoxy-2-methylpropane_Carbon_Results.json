    "context": "Complex community patterns were observed for basin water and textile samples and were significantly altered compared to inflow groundwater (Fig.\u00a07 ). Water samples from the basins were very similar, whereas textile samples differed from each other and also from all water samples.Total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and biological oxygen demand (BOD) The system showed overall reductions of 61% for COD, 57\u201359% for TOC, and 71\u201373% for BOD. These parameters together with the calculated electron equivalents for the COD values and the summarized average MTBE, benzene, iron(II) and ammonium concentrations are shown (Table 4 ). To facilitate better comparison, the organic carbon content based on the MTBE and benzene concentrations was calculated and individual POC/NPOC values are provided for inflow and outflow groundwaters. The TOC fractions in the inflow were 29.5% and 70.5% for NPOC and POC, respectively. The NPOC showed no significant decrease whereas the POC decreased up to 92%, and equals the calculated sum of MTBE and benzene in mg C/L. In fact, this reduction is mainly due to benzene removal. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around total organic carbon (TOC) and its relationship with various organic compounds, including benzene and MTBE. Carbon is a fundamental element in organic compounds, and the analysis of TOC indicates the presence of carbon in the samples. However, there is no specific interaction or relevance established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms relate to organic chemistry and carbon content in environmental samples, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship.",
