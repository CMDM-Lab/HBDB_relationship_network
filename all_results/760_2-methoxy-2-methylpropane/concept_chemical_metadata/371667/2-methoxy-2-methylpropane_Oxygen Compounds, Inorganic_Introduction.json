    "context": "Groundwater fuel contamination is generally characterized by a large chemical oxygen demand (COD). Therefore, increased oxygen concentrations are positively correlated with biodegradation rates. However, it is a challenge to supply sufficient amounts of oxygen into contaminated aquifers due to its low solubility. Enhanced biodegradation of BTEX (Borden et\u00a0al., 1997) and MTBE (Salanitro et\u00a0al., 2000; Wilson et\u00a0al., 2002) has been achieved by active measures such as direct oxygen injection, or passive measures like introduction of oxygen-releasing compounds into the system. However, the long-term efficiency of reactive barriers may be impacted by biofilm clogging or precipitate formation (Scherer et\u00a0al., 2000). Aerobic ponds have found worldwide application in municipal wastewater treatment; however, degradation of fuel related contaminants in combination with ammonium is poorly investigated in these systems (Thorneby et\u00a0al., 2006). Photosynthetic algae and bacteria as well physical aeration are often used to support oxic degradation processes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to inorganic oxygen compounds through the discussion of oxygen's role in enhancing biodegradation rates of contaminants in groundwater. While the text emphasizes the importance of oxygen for biodegradation processes, it does not specifically link 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane to inorganic oxygen compounds or detail their interaction. Instead, it focuses on the broader context of oxygen supply challenges in contaminated aquifers.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the broader context of biodegradation and oxygen's role in that process, but there is no direct relationship or specific interaction discussed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and inorganic oxygen compounds.",
