    "context": "4.1.3 MTBE MTBE biodegradation was by far not as effective as benzene biodegradation. MTBE is more resistant to enzymatic attacks due to its tertiary carbon atom and the ether bond (Davidson and Creek, 2000). However, an MTBE-degrading \u03b2-proteobacterium strain L108, capable of growing on fuel oxygenate ethers as the sole source of carbon and energy, was previously isolated from the Leuna site (Rohwerder et\u00a0al., 2006) and demonstrates a natural attenuation potential for MTBE at this location. Volatilization analyses showed that 48\u201353% of the removed MTBE was stripped. The residual amount might be biodegraded, although biodegradation could not be demonstrated in vitro during the first 6 months of system operation. However, from August \u201808, the coconut textile basin showed increasing MTBE removal rates of up to 67% in December \u201808 (Fig.\u00a04). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is discussed in relation to its biodegradation, specifically highlighting its resistance due to the presence of a tertiary carbon atom and an ether bond. The mention of carbon refers to its role as a source of energy for the MTBE-degrading \u03b2-proteobacterium strain L108, which utilizes fuel oxygenate ethers like MTBE as its sole carbon source. This indicates a direct relationship between the compound and carbon in the context of biodegradation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon, as the context discusses the compound's structure and its role as a carbon source for microbial degradation. The relationship is supported by the mention of specific biochemical interactions.",
