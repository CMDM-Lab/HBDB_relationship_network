    "context": "For the low-floor apartments, the median concentrations of the three VOCs for the nighttime samples (MTBE, 6.1\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 7.7\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 36.9\u03bcg/m3) were consistently 1.2\u20131.4 times higher than those for the daytime samples (MTBE, 4.5\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 6.2\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 25.9\u03bcg/m3). For the high-floor apartments, the median concentrations of the three VOCs for the nighttime samples (MTBE, 5.1\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 4.8\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 24.8\u03bcg/m3) were consistently 1.3\u20131.4 times higher than those for the daytime samples (MTBE, 4.0\u03bcg/m3; benzene, 3.5\u03bcg/m3; and toluene, 19.8\u03bcg/m3). Moreover, for all the target compounds, the indoor air concentrations for the nighttime samples were significantly higher than those for the daytime samples for both low- and high-floor apartments, with a P value of less than or close to 0.05 (P<0.09 for the o-xylene level for low-floor apartments). The current study found that both the outdoor and the indoor air concentrations of three VOCs (MTBE, benzene, and toluene) were higher for low-floor apartments than for high-floor apartments, indicating that residents of low-floor apartments are exposed to elevated residential levels of these compounds compared to high-floor apartment residents.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in indoor air samples. However, the text primarily focuses on the concentrations of toluene and other VOCs in low- and high-floor apartments, without detailing any specific interaction or relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is coincidental, as they are part of a broader discussion on VOC levels in residential settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene, as they are simply listed among other VOCs without any specific interaction or relevance discussed in the context.",
