    "context": "According to the Korean National Statistics Office, about 22 million people live in Korea\u2019s eight largest cities and about 10 million of these live in high-rise apartments (defined as 10 or more stories). As such, it can be expected that apartment residents are exposed to motor vehicle emissions from vehicles in the apartment parking lots and nearby roadways. Since low-floor apartments are vertically closer to parking lots and roadways, we hypothesized that residents in low-floor apartments might be exposed to elevated ambient levels of motor vehicle emissions compared to residents in high-floor apartments. Accordingly, the present study was designed to examine this theory by measuring seven VOCs [methyl-tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene] in the air outside of low- and high-floor apartments. Most of the target compounds are ubiquitous and persistent VOCs present in automotive evaporative and exhaust emissions, gasoline and other petroleum products, and tobacco smoke. There are also various indoor sources of aromatic target VOCs, including cigarette smoke, consumer products employing solvents, and combustion sources (Higgins et al., 1983; Schneider et al., 1999; Wallace et al., 1989). Therefore, this also raises the issue of whether outdoor sources, such as apartment parking lots and nearby roadways, actually outweigh indoor sources of VOC exposure for apartment residents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be present in the air surrounding low- and high-floor apartments due to motor vehicle emissions and other sources. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the context of exposure levels or health effects, indicating a general association rather than a detailed relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to the study of air quality in urban settings, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
        "score": 2
