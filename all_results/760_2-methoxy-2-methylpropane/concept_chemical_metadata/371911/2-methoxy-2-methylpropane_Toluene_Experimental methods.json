    "context": "About 1.1 million Daegu residents live in high-rise apartments. Based on the statistical yearbook for Daegu published in February 1999, the number of vehicles registered in the Daegu metropolitan area was as follows: 447,296 passenger cars, 18,142 taxicabs, 50,059 buses (2813 public buses), 131,147 trucks, 120,125 motorcycles, and 832 special cars. Most of the passenger cars and motorcycles consume gasoline, while the buses and taxis generally use diesel fuel and liquid petroleum gas (LPG), respectively. Survey protocol The current study measured the concentrations of seven selected VOCs (MTBE, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene) in the outdoor and indoor air of high-rise apartment buildings during the spring (from March through May) of 2001. Two hundred eighty-one homes in 86 apartment buildings that satisfied the experimental criteria were approached for permission to measure the air levels inside the apartments. The criteria were as follows: the apartment buildings were to be high-rise apartment buildings with 10 or more stories; the buildings were to be located at least 100m from any gas stations (to minimize the impact of service stations on the apartment ambient VOC levels) and the exteriors of the apartments were not to have been painted within at least 1 year before the study. Residents of 112 homes in 56 apartment buildings with 10 or more stories granted permission for measurement of air levels and participated in the present study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be present in the air of high-rise apartments. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or comparative significance in the study. They are simply part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations in urban environments.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs measured in the same study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other.",
