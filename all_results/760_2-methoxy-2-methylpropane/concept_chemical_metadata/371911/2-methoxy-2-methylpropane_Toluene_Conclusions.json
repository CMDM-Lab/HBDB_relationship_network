    "context": "This conclusion is based on the findings that both the outdoor and indoor air concentrations of three VOCs [methyl-tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), benzene, and toluene] were higher for low-floor apartments than for high-floor apartments. The indoor concentrations of MTBE were similar to the outdoor concentrations, whereas the indoor concentrations of the other target compounds were significantly higher than the outdoor air concentrations for both low- and high-floor apartments. This indicates that outdoor sources, such as apartment parking lots and nearby roadways, did not outweigh indoor sources of exposure of apartment residents, regardless of the apartment floor. Moreover, for both low and high floors, the outdoor and indoor air concentrations of three VOCs (MTBE, benzene, and toluene) were higher at night than during the day, suggesting that the time of day is an important parameter for residential exposure. The vehicle cabin has recently been recognized as an important microenvironment that can result in personal exposure to many volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Accordingly, several studies (SCAQMD, 1989; Chan et al., 1991a,b; Weisel et al., 1992; Dor et al., 1995; Lawryk and Weisel, 1996; Rodes et al., 1998; Jo and Park, 1998, 1999) have identified that individuals inside vehicles are exposed to elevated levels of five to 24 VOCs when compared with the corresponding ambient air at nearby monitoring sites. These elevated levels result from the penetration of gasoline-derived VOCs from roadway air plus in-vehicle evaporative emissions in the case of passenger cars. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to indoor air pollution in residential settings. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are primarily noted for their presence in the air rather than any direct interaction or comparative analysis. The focus is on their concentrations in different apartment settings rather than their chemical properties or effects on health.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to air quality, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or significance in the context provided.",
