    "context": "The current results are consistent with those of Jo and Moon (1999), who previously reported that the residential outdoor levels of gasoline-derived VOCs were higher when measured in close horizontal proximity to roadside service stations than those measured a short distance away. Conversely, they reported that unlike the outdoor air concentrations, the indoor air concentrations did not differ between the two residential zones. Nonetheless, the current findings support the theory that the vertical proximity of a residence location to motor vehicles in apartment parking lots and nearby roadways would be associated with high residential exposure to vehicle emission markers. For both types of apartment (low and high floor), the outdoor and indoor air concentrations of the vehicle emissions markers (MTBE, benzene, and toluene) were higher at night than during the day. The current results are consistent with those reported by Wallace et al. (1991), who found that overnight outdoor concentrations of VOCs exceeded daytime levels in Los Angeles, assuming that the overnight inversions could lead to higher nighttime levels. In the present study, the higher outdoor concentrations during the night were most likely due to the greater number of vehicles in the parking lots as well as the nocturnal inversion effect, since most apartment residents drive their cars to work in the morning and then return to the parking lot after work to park overnight. The higher indoor concentrations during the night were likely due to the combined effects of the penetration of the elevated nighttime outdoor target pollutants and a stronger nighttime source strength (smoking).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with vehicle emissions and indoor air quality. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are not shown to interact or influence each other directly. Instead, they are part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations in residential areas near roadways and parking lots, indicating their presence in similar environmental contexts without a specific connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to air quality studies, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
