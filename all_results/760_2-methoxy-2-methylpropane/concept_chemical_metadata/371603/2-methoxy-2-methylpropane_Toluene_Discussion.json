    "context": "An effective benzene biodegradation could be expected in the two RF and PF filter systems, since this pollutant has been degraded in environmental systems even under hypoxic conditions and treatment efficiencies for aerobic bioreactors up to 100% have been described (Yerushalmi et\u00a0al., 2002). In contrast, MTBE biodegradation is reported to be by far not as effective as benzene biodegradation. The possible reasons might be that MTBE is more resistant to enzymatic attacks due to its tertiary carbon atom and the ether bond (Davidson and Creek, 2000). Moreover, it is reported that the biodegradation of MTBE might be inhibited due to the presence of co-contaminants, such as benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene (BTEX), and the accumulation of by-products from the biodegradation of BTEX compounds (Raynal and Pruden, 2008). An inhibition of MTBE biodegradation in the presence of BTEX due to a potential production of by-products has also been suggested by others (Deeb et\u00a0al., 2001; Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). These studies have focused mainly on substrate inhibition (Park, 1999), by-product inhibition (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2002) or competitive inhibition (Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). Therefore, the presence of BTEX compounds in the groundwater of the refinery site was expected to inhibit MTBE biodegradation in both the RF and PF systems. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are mentioned as co-contaminants that may influence the biodegradation of MTBE. The presence of toluene, along with other BTEX compounds, is suggested to inhibit the biodegradation process of MTBE, potentially due to competitive inhibition or the production of by-products. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene themselves.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are mentioned in relation to their impact on MTBE biodegradation, but their specific relationship is not elaborated upon.",
