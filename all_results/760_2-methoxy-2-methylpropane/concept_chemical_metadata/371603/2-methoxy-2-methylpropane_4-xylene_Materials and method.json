    "context": "The detection limit for MTBE and benzene was 0.37 and 0.18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. The determination of detection and quantification limits of the calibration procedure was carried out in accordance with DIN 32645 (1994). Process control and data storage were carried out using the installed software (metaControl) that stored all the measurements and optional external signals on the hard disk of the attached PC. Known intermediate degradation products of MTBE, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), tert-butyl formate (TBF) and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethylbenzene, m-p-Xylene, o-Xylene, 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene and Naphthalene were analysed in both influent groundwater and effluents from the filters by headspace gas chromatography and mass spectroscopic detection (HS-GC\u2013MS). For headspace analysis, aqueous samples (10\u00a0ml) were stirred for 60\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C in headspace vials (20\u00a0ml) containing 2.5\u00a0g NaCl. Gas from the headspace (1\u00a0ml) was injected into a GC/MS (GC: Agilent 6890, MS: Agilent 5973) equipped with a 60\u00a0m HP1 column (Split injection 1:25, injection time 2\u00a0min). The time program was: 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0min, to 120\u00a0\u00b0C with 4\u00a0\u00b0C/min and to 280\u00a0\u00b0C with 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min, held at 280\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a broader analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and effluents. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships. They are included in a list of compounds analyzed for their presence in environmental samples, indicating they are part of the same study but without any detailed connection between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 4-xylene are merely listed among other VOCs analyzed in the study without any specific interaction or relevance discussed.",
