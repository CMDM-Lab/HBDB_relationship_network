Due to the widespread use of fuels, BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-, o-, and p-xylene) and MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) are frequently detected groundwater contaminants, with releases occurring during their production, transportation and storage (Baehr et\u00a0al., 1999; Deeb et\u00a0al., 2000; Squillace et\u00a0al., 1996). MTBE has received considerable attention in recent times as it migrates much more quickly through the soil than most of the petroleum distillates due to its high water solubility (up to 51\u00a0g\u00a0L\u22121, USEPA, 2004). Its presence in the environment is considered as a health and drinking water problem and classifies MTBE as a possible human carcinogen (Johnson et\u00a0al., 2000). MTBE is relatively resistant to biological degradation under anaerobic conditions (Moreels et\u00a0al., 2006), but several studies have shown a biodegradability under aerobic conditions (Deeb et\u00a0al., 2000; Ferreira et\u00a0al., 2006; Schmidt et\u00a0al., 2004).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as components of BTEX compounds, which are common groundwater contaminants. However, the text primarily focuses on the environmental impact and degradation of MTBE, with no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is more about their classification as contaminants rather than any functional or chemical relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized under BTEX and discussed in the context of groundwater contamination. However, there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions.",
