    "context": "But these inhibitory effects on MTBE biodegradation could not be observed in both the filters during this study. Table 4 shows the presence of BTEX and other aromatic hydrocarbons in the influent groundwater with a mean concentration value and still a highly efficient MTBE-concentration reduction (93\u201398%) can be seen especially in the effluent of the PF during single-stage operation (Table 3). However, very little is known about the microbial community structure during the aerobic MTBE degradation in the presence of BTEX. The disappearance of MTBE metabolites, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF) indicated the potential of complete biodegradation within the filter systems. As can be seen in Table 4, the mean concentrations of TBA and TBF were remarkably decreased in the effluent of the RF and the PF system during the single-stage operation period and almost completely diminished or biodegraded after passing through the second filter (PF) during the multi-stage operation period.MTBE and benzene removal performances: multi-stage system The second operational period with a multi-staged combined (RF\u00a0+\u00a0PF) vertical-flow soil filter system runs very well with a highly efficient MTBE and benzene removal. Both MTBE and benzene effluent concentrations were always stable and well below the allowable limit value after the second treatment step. Moreover, the high HLR in the first filter (RF) was not accompanied by hydraulic or technical problems, such as clogging, overloading, etc., and it was thus very encouraging to a further increase of HLR, which could reduce the cost of the required land for the filter construction.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to metabolites through the discussion of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) biodegradation. The metabolites mentioned, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF), are products of MTBE degradation, indicating that while 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly analyzed, it is part of a broader discussion on the degradation of similar compounds and their metabolites in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and metabolites, as they share a general context of biodegradation processes, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship.",
