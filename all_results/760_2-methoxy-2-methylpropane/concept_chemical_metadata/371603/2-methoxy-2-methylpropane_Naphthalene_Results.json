    "context": "However, after passing through the second filter (PF), a remarkably low and stable benzene concentration was detected in the effluent of the PF system. The mean value of 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 in the effluent of the second filter contributed to an almost complete (\u223c100%) removal of benzene in this combined multi-stage system. The overall treatment performances obtained in both filters (RF and PF) during the whole operational period of this study are summarized in Table 3 . The mean concentrations of intermediate degradation products of MTBE (TBA, TBF) and other aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethylbenzene, m-p-Xylene, o-Xylene, 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene and Naphthalene in the influent groundwater and effluents of both the RF and the PF are given in Table 4 . Both TBA and TBF were detected with a low mean concentration value in the effluent of the RF and the PF system during the single-stage operational phase, but their concentrations were almost diminished or went below the detection limit in the final effluent after passing the multi-stage system. Similarly, in the final effluent of the multi-stage operational phase, the other aromatic hydrocarbons could not be detected due to a very low concentration value at the end (see Table 4).Emission estimation The emissions of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air phase at several specified heights over the vertical-flow soil filter systems at a given day in several measurement cycles were registered and plotted on curves in this study. The measurements were recorded during the single-stage operation period at the same HLR of 480\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121 in both filters (experimental phase IV). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and naphthalene are both mentioned as part of a broader discussion on the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between the two compounds. They are included in a list of aromatic hydrocarbons analyzed in the influent and effluent of a multi-stage filtration system, but their individual roles or interactions are not explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and naphthalene are merely listed among other VOCs without any discussion of their interactions or significance in the context of the study.",
