    "context": "This experimental phase V was run over a period of 223 days (days 388\u2013611). Similarly to operational period 1 (single-stage configuration), both filters (RF and PF) were intermittently loaded with repeated pulses of groundwater (Table 2). The experiment started with period 1 in September 2008 and continued until the end of period 2 in May 2010. Willow trees on the PF system showed an active growth of their biomass, densely covering the whole filter surface area with green and healthy shoots before the start of the experiment.Sampling and analysis Concentrations of dissolved MTBE and benzene at the influent and effluent of each system were analysed online using a completely automated gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a photoionisation detector (PID) (META Water sampling and analysis system WSS3; type: meta 3 HE II/PID, META, Messtechnische Systeme GmbH, Dresden, Germany). An Ultimetal column with a length of 25\u00a0m was used and the carrier gas was synthetic air, set at 5\u00a0bar. The oven and injection/detection port temperatures were 60 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The detection limit for MTBE and benzene was 0.37 and 0.18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and water specimen are mentioned in relation to an experimental setup involving groundwater filtration systems. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between the two substances. The focus is primarily on the analysis of dissolved contaminants like MTBE and benzene in the water, without elaborating on the role of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane in this process.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and water specimen are mentioned in the same context but without any direct relevance or interaction described between them.",
