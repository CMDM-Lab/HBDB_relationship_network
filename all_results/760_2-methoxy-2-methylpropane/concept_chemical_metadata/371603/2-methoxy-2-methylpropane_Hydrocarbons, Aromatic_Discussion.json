    "context": "These studies have focused mainly on substrate inhibition (Park, 1999), by-product inhibition (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2002) or competitive inhibition (Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). Therefore, the presence of BTEX compounds in the groundwater of the refinery site was expected to inhibit MTBE biodegradation in both the RF and PF systems. But these inhibitory effects on MTBE biodegradation could not be observed in both the filters during this study. Table 4 shows the presence of BTEX and other aromatic hydrocarbons in the influent groundwater with a mean concentration value and still a highly efficient MTBE-concentration reduction (93\u201398%) can be seen especially in the effluent of the PF during single-stage operation (Table 3). However, very little is known about the microbial community structure during the aerobic MTBE degradation in the presence of BTEX. The disappearance of MTBE metabolites, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF) indicated the potential of complete biodegradation within the filter systems. As can be seen in Table 4, the mean concentrations of TBA and TBF were remarkably decreased in the effluent of the RF and the PF system during the single-stage operation period and almost completely diminished or biodegraded after passing through the second filter (PF) during the multi-stage operation period.MTBE and benzene removal performances: multi-stage system The second operational period with a multi-staged combined (RF\u00a0+\u00a0PF) vertical-flow soil filter system runs very well with a highly efficient MTBE and benzene removal.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned but is implied as a potential compound of interest in the study of biodegradation processes involving aromatic hydrocarbons, specifically BTEX compounds. The focus is on the inhibitory effects of these aromatic hydrocarbons on the biodegradation of MTBE, indicating a broader relationship between various hydrocarbons, including 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, and their interactions in environmental remediation processes. However, the specific relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and aromatic hydrocarbons is not explicitly detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms relate to hydrocarbons and their environmental interactions, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions in the context provided.",
