    "context": "Benzene is carcinogenic and the most water soluble BTEX compound. It can also be degraded by many microorganisms under aerobic conditions (Yerushalmi et\u00a0al., 2002). The present limit concentrations established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the German guideline value are 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 for MTBE and 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 for benzene in drinking water (USEPA, 2005; DVGW, 2001). The physico-chemical properties especially the high water solubility and the low carbon adsorption coefficient of MTBE make it difficult to treat these organic contaminants by using conventional groundwater treatment technologies and represent some unique remediation challenges. The active ex-situ remedial methods include air stripping and removal with granular activated carbon, vapour extraction, advanced chemical oxidation and multiphase high-vacuum extraction (Davis and Powers, 2000; Deeb et\u00a0al., 2003; Sutherland et\u00a0al., 2004; Wilhelm et\u00a0al., 2002). However, the cost associated with the construction, maintenance and operation of these treatments diminishes their feasibility. Constructed wetland (CW) systems represent an effective and inexpensive option for treating municipal wastewater and becoming available due to their wide range of applications (Cooper, 1999; Kadlec and Wallace, 2009).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly discussed, but it is implied as a compound related to the broader category of organic contaminants, which includes carbon-based compounds like benzene and MTBE. The mention of carbon primarily relates to its role in the physico-chemical properties of these compounds, particularly regarding their solubility and adsorption characteristics. However, there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms relate to organic compounds and their properties, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
