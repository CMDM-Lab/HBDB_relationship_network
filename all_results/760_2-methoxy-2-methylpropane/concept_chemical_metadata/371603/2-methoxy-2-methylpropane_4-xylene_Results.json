    "context": "However, after passing through the second filter (PF), a remarkably low and stable benzene concentration was detected in the effluent of the PF system. The mean value of 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 in the effluent of the second filter contributed to an almost complete (\u223c100%) removal of benzene in this combined multi-stage system. The overall treatment performances obtained in both filters (RF and PF) during the whole operational period of this study are summarized in Table 3 . The mean concentrations of intermediate degradation products of MTBE (TBA, TBF) and other aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethylbenzene, m-p-Xylene, o-Xylene, 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene and Naphthalene in the influent groundwater and effluents of both the RF and the PF are given in Table 4 . Both TBA and TBF were detected with a low mean concentration value in the effluent of the RF and the PF system during the single-stage operational phase, but their concentrations were almost diminished or went below the detection limit in the final effluent after passing the multi-stage system. Similarly, in the final effluent of the multi-stage operational phase, the other aromatic hydrocarbons could not be detected due to a very low concentration value at the end (see Table 4).Emission estimation The emissions of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air phase at several specified heights over the vertical-flow soil filter systems at a given day in several measurement cycles were registered and plotted on curves in this study. The measurements were recorded during the single-stage operation period at the same HLR of 480\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121 in both filters (experimental phase IV). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a broader discussion on the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a multi-stage filtration system. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between these two compounds. They are included in a list of aromatic hydrocarbons and degradation products, but their individual roles or connections are not explored.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized under VOCs and aromatic hydrocarbons treated in the same filtration system, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions.",
