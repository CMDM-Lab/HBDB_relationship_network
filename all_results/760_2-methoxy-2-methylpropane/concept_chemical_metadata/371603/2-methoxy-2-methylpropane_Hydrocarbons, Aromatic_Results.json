    "context": "However, after passing through the second filter (PF), a remarkably low and stable benzene concentration was detected in the effluent of the PF system. The mean value of 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 in the effluent of the second filter contributed to an almost complete (\u223c100%) removal of benzene in this combined multi-stage system. The overall treatment performances obtained in both filters (RF and PF) during the whole operational period of this study are summarized in Table 3 . The mean concentrations of intermediate degradation products of MTBE (TBA, TBF) and other aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethylbenzene, m-p-Xylene, o-Xylene, 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene and Naphthalene in the influent groundwater and effluents of both the RF and the PF are given in Table 4 . Both TBA and TBF were detected with a low mean concentration value in the effluent of the RF and the PF system during the single-stage operational phase, but their concentrations were almost diminished or went below the detection limit in the final effluent after passing the multi-stage system. Similarly, in the final effluent of the multi-stage operational phase, the other aromatic hydrocarbons could not be detected due to a very low concentration value at the end (see Table 4).Emission estimation The emissions of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the air phase at several specified heights over the vertical-flow soil filter systems at a given day in several measurement cycles were registered and plotted on curves in this study. The measurements were recorded during the single-stage operation period at the same HLR of 480\u00a0L\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0d\u22121 in both filters (experimental phase IV). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene and toluene, from groundwater through a multi-stage filtration system. Aromatic hydrocarbons are a category that may include various compounds, potentially including 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, but the specific relationship or interaction between them is not detailed. The focus is primarily on the treatment performance of the filtration system rather than on the properties or interactions of the individual hydrocarbons.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms relate to hydrocarbons, but there is no specific discussion of how 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane interacts with or is treated alongside the aromatic hydrocarbons mentioned.",
