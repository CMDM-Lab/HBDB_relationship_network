    "context": "The detection limit for MTBE and benzene was 0.37 and 0.18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. The determination of detection and quantification limits of the calibration procedure was carried out in accordance with DIN 32645 (1994). Process control and data storage were carried out using the installed software (metaControl) that stored all the measurements and optional external signals on the hard disk of the attached PC. Known intermediate degradation products of MTBE, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), tert-butyl formate (TBF) and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethylbenzene, m-p-Xylene, o-Xylene, 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene and Naphthalene were analysed in both influent groundwater and effluents from the filters by headspace gas chromatography and mass spectroscopic detection (HS-GC\u2013MS). For headspace analysis, aqueous samples (10\u00a0ml) were stirred for 60\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C in headspace vials (20\u00a0ml) containing 2.5\u00a0g NaCl. Gas from the headspace (1\u00a0ml) was injected into a GC/MS (GC: Agilent 6890, MS: Agilent 5973) equipped with a 60\u00a0m HP1 column (Split injection 1:25, injection time 2\u00a0min). The time program was: 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0min, to 120\u00a0\u00b0C with 4\u00a0\u00b0C/min and to 280\u00a0\u00b0C with 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min, held at 280\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and naphthalene are both mentioned as aromatic hydrocarbons analyzed in groundwater samples using headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction, as they are simply listed among other compounds without any specific functional or chemical connection highlighted in the analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and naphthalene are only mentioned together in the context of analytical methods without any indication of interaction or relevance to each other.",
