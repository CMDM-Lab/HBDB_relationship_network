    "context": "However, more investigations are needed before making any concluding remarks on these particular assumptions. An effective benzene biodegradation could be expected in the two RF and PF filter systems, since this pollutant has been degraded in environmental systems even under hypoxic conditions and treatment efficiencies for aerobic bioreactors up to 100% have been described (Yerushalmi et\u00a0al., 2002). In contrast, MTBE biodegradation is reported to be by far not as effective as benzene biodegradation. The possible reasons might be that MTBE is more resistant to enzymatic attacks due to its tertiary carbon atom and the ether bond (Davidson and Creek, 2000). Moreover, it is reported that the biodegradation of MTBE might be inhibited due to the presence of co-contaminants, such as benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene (BTEX), and the accumulation of by-products from the biodegradation of BTEX compounds (Raynal and Pruden, 2008). An inhibition of MTBE biodegradation in the presence of BTEX due to a potential production of by-products has also been suggested by others (Deeb et\u00a0al., 2001; Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). These studies have focused mainly on substrate inhibition (Park, 1999), by-product inhibition (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2002) or competitive inhibition (Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to carbon through its chemical structure, which includes carbon atoms. The discussion focuses on the biodegradation of MTBE, a compound with a tertiary carbon atom, highlighting the challenges posed by its structure in enzymatic degradation. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon beyond their basic chemical composition.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related through chemical structure, but there is no detailed discussion of their functional relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
