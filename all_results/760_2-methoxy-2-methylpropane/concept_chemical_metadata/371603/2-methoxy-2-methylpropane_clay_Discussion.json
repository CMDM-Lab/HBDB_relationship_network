    "context": "In the case of benzene, a mean removal within a range of 97\u201399% was achieved in the RF, but the overall effluent concentrations were never below the limit value of 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121. In contrast, the PF system exhibited a highly efficient benzene concentration reduction and the effluent concentrations were predominantly found to be below 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 (see Fig.\u00a03A and B). The differences in the MTBE and benzene treatment performance observed in the RF and PF might be due to the differences in filter designs mainly defined by the different filtering media used as the main filter materials (expanded clay in the RF and zeosoil in the PF; Fig.\u00a01). The obtained results show that a filter loaded with a fine zeosoil (0\u20135\u00a0mm) filter material and plants is more efficient in MTBE and benzene removal than a filter loaded with a coarse expanded clay material (3\u20136\u00a0mm) without plants. This is probably due to a higher reactive surface area, a better oxygen transfer and a higher hydraulic retention time (data not shown) within the filter loaded with fine materials. But finer materials have the disadvantage of a possible filter clogging and also the problem associated with water saturation at high hydraulic loads. Additionally the differences in effective depth and different compactions of the filter bed, different gas exchange rates and plant\u2013root activity in the case of the PF that provide oxygen to the rhizosphere (Scholz, 2006) might explain the observed differences in treatment performance.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the performance of different filter materials, including expanded clay, in the removal of contaminants like benzene and MTBE. The relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and clay is not established, as the focus is on the efficiency of clay as a filter medium rather than any specific interaction with 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and clay in the context provided. They are mentioned in the same discussion about filtration but without any relevant connection.",
