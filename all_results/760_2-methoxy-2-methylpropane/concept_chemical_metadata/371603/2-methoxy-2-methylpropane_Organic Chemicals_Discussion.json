    "context": "Volatilization of toxic organic hydrocarbons may be increased by technological problems, such as clogging and subsequent flooding, and may lead to serious air pollution (Braeckevelt et\u00a0al., 2008). But both of our vertical-flow soil filter systems were almost free of technical problems such as filter clogging, overloading, surface flooding, etc. Experimental investigations have shown that phyto-volatilization is a potential emission path for MTBE and benzene along with the direct volatilization via the soil surface of a constructed wetland (Reiche et\u00a0al., 2010). However, more improved technical equipment is necessary for measuring both the VOCs concentration in the air and the volume of air emitted from the surface of the filter beds. Future investigations should be carried out with the purpose of a final evaluation of the volatilization rate of MTBE and benzene per unit area (m2) of the filter surface and with the aim of achieving a complete mass balance of organic compounds and discovering the role of the cover layer for protecting volatilization. The following conclusions can be drawn from the current study: 1. The Polishing Filter (PF) with a finer material and plants is more efficient in removing MTBE and benzene from contaminated groundwater, as compared to the Roughing Filter (RF) with a coarse material and without plants. 2. Factors, such as filter packing material, particle size, filter depth and loading rate, are playing an important role in achieving a robust filter operation for the removal of organic contaminants by vertical-flow soil filter systems.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to organic chemicals as it is a specific type of organic compound. The discussion focuses on the volatilization of toxic organic hydrocarbons, including MTBE and benzene, in relation to soil filter systems. However, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not specifically mentioned or analyzed, limiting the depth of its relationship with organic chemicals in this study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is categorized under organic chemicals, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or relevance in the context provided.",
