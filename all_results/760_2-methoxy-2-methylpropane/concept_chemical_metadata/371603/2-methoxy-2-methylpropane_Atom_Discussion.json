    "context": "However, more investigations are needed before making any concluding remarks on these particular assumptions. An effective benzene biodegradation could be expected in the two RF and PF filter systems, since this pollutant has been degraded in environmental systems even under hypoxic conditions and treatment efficiencies for aerobic bioreactors up to 100% have been described (Yerushalmi et\u00a0al., 2002). In contrast, MTBE biodegradation is reported to be by far not as effective as benzene biodegradation. The possible reasons might be that MTBE is more resistant to enzymatic attacks due to its tertiary carbon atom and the ether bond (Davidson and Creek, 2000). Moreover, it is reported that the biodegradation of MTBE might be inhibited due to the presence of co-contaminants, such as benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene (BTEX), and the accumulation of by-products from the biodegradation of BTEX compounds (Raynal and Pruden, 2008). An inhibition of MTBE biodegradation in the presence of BTEX due to a potential production of by-products has also been suggested by others (Deeb et\u00a0al., 2001; Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). These studies have focused mainly on substrate inhibition (Park, 1999), by-product inhibition (Wilson et\u00a0al., 2002) or competitive inhibition (Sedran et\u00a0al., 2002). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to the biodegradation of pollutants like benzene and MTBE, which involves understanding the chemical structure of these compounds, including the presence of specific atoms such as tertiary carbon atoms. However, there is no direct discussion of the relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the concept of an 'atom' itself, making their connection very general and indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the broader topic of chemical structure and biodegradation, but there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship discussed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the concept of an atom.",
