    "context": "All analytes show stable responses after 50 cycles, meaning that additional cycles do not further increase peak areas. However, the differences in individual extraction profiles are relatively high, especially for the first 10 aspiration cycles. Since with the chosen experimental settings, a laminar flow in the needle is obtained (Reynolds number Re of around 22), the equilibration time increases linearly with the sorbent-air partitioning coefficient K sa  . The rapid equilibration for MTBE compared with the low chain alcohols shown in Fig. 5 thus seems to be caused by a rather low K sa value.Addition of salt and determination of Setschenow constants The influence of electrolyte addition (sodium chloride) to the sample solution on extraction yield was tested by using 50 extraction cycles and an extraction temperature of 70\u00b0C. Five different concentration levels from 0 to 25% NaCl (w/w) were used. Higher concentration levels were not used because of (i) approaching the sodium chloride water solubility and inadequately long dissolving times, and (ii) previous reports of decreased sensitivities for MTBE and no substantial increase in sensitivity for ethanol, tert-butanol and isopropanol for salt concentrations above 25% (w/w). The addition of salt increases the sample volume and therefore volume correction factors were determined experimentally for the tested salt concentrations and applied in all subsequent calculations.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to the extraction process, where the influence of electrolytes, specifically sodium chloride, on extraction yield is tested. The addition of salt is shown to affect the extraction efficiency, indicating a relationship where electrolytes can modify the behavior of organic compounds like 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane during extraction processes. However, the specific interactions between the two are not deeply explored, focusing more on the general effect of electrolytes on extraction yields.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the role of electrolytes in the extraction process involving 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, indicating some interaction but lacking detailed exploration of their relationship.",
