    "context": "In the case of ethers, 1,4-dioxane, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were selected because of their frequent occurrence in environmental aqueous matrices (rain, surface, and groundwater) [17\u201319]. Some of the small chain alcohols are also used as fuel oxygenates or are present in fuel at low concentrations, are used as partitioning tracers for the characterization of residual nonaqueous phase liquids, and are important analytes in food science, e.g., because of their presence in alcoholic beverages (\u201cfusel oils\u201d). The occurrence of 2-ethylhexanol in drinking water has been reported, probably from its presence in polymers as a by-product of 2-ethylhexyl phthalate synthesis. Some of the investigated compounds, e.g., MTBE, tetrahydrofuran, and 2-ethylhexanol have been selected as candidates for further investigations in the OECD Screening Information Data Sets (SIDS) because of their high production rates, toxicity and physicochemical behavior. The main objective of this work was to provide a sensitive, robust, and fast method for determination of PVOC in aqueous matrices using SPDE. To this end, we (i) studied in detail the effects of the most important extraction parameters on partitioning of the target compounds (i.e., extraction temperature, ionic strength, and number of extraction cycles), (ii) compared different extraction phases for the probe compounds with regard to achievable method detection limits (MDLs), and (iii) demonstrated the application of SPDE for the determination of fusel oils in alcoholic beverages and of salting-out constants (Setschenow constants). Chemicals and reagents Methanol (99.9%) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) was used to prepare stock solutions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are both mentioned as compounds selected for investigation due to their occurrence in environmental aqueous matrices and their relevance in studies related to toxicity and physicochemical behavior. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships, indicating they are part of a broader category of ethers and solvents being analyzed for environmental impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and tetrahydrofuran, as both are included in a study of environmental contaminants. However, their relationship lacks detailed exploration or specific interactions, limiting the relevance.",
