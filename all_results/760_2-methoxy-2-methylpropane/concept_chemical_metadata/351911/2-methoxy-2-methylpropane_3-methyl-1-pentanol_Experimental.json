    "context": "Chemicals and reagents Methanol (99.9%) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) was used to prepare stock solutions. The methanol was checked by GC\u2013MS for its purity and the absence of the investigated low chain alcohols. As solvent for the preparation of standard solutions, Milli-Q water was used from a Milli-Q Plus water purification system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Ethanol (99%) and tetrahydrofuran (99.9%) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), tert-butanol (99.5%), 2-butanol (99.5%), 1-pentanol (99+ %), 1-propanol (99+ %), 3-methyl-1-pentanol (99%), 1-hexanol (98%), and 2-ethylhexanol (99.6%) from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), isopropanol (99.5%), isobutanol (99%), methyl tert-butyl ether were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) and 1-butanol (99.5%), 3-pentanol (99.5%), 1,4-dioxane (99.5%) were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Tert-butanol-d10 (99%) from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) and 1,4-dioxane-d8 (99+%) from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) were used as internal standards. Table 1 shows the physico-chemical properties of the investigated analytes. Sodium chloride (> 99.5%) purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) was used to vary the ionic strength of the water samples.Stock solutions and standard mixtures Methanolic stock solutions with a concentration of 1000mg/L were prepared with a 100\u03bcL gastight glass syringe in 10mL volumetric flasks.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 3-methyl-1-pentanol are both mentioned as part of a list of chemicals and reagents used in preparing stock solutions and standard mixtures. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical properties, interactions, or relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the same inventory of substances. Thus, their relationship is coincidental and lacks any detailed exploration.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 3-methyl-1-pentanol are merely listed together among other chemicals without any specific interaction or relevance discussed in the context.",
