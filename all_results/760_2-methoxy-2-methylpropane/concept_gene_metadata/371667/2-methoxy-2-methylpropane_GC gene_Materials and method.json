    "context": "The COD was analysed using the LCK 314 cuvette test system (HACH LANGE GmbH, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) according to the manufacturers instructions. Benzene concentrations were determined by taking a 1\u00a0ml aliquot from a sample with a sterile syringe, and added to 9\u00a0ml water (adjusted to pH 2.5 with sulphuric acid) in 20\u00a0ml GC-vials. Samples were analysed on a gas-chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) (CP-3800 GC, Varian Inc., USA) described elsewhere (Fischer et\u00a0al., 2008). The concentration of MTBE was determined by another GC-FID system (HP 6890 GC, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) described elsewhere (Rosell et\u00a0al., 2010).Determination of viable cell counts Most probable number (MPN) counts for aerobic benzene and MTBE metabolizing bacteria were determined using 10 replicates and a 1:10 dilution carried out to 10\u22128 in 96 well plates (8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012\u00a0wells, Nunc, Apogent, Denmark). Sample volumes of 500\u00a0\u03bcl from in and outflow water or 500\u00a0\u03bcl of extracted cell solution from biofilms were inoculated into 4.5\u00a0ml of R2A medium (Reasoner and Geldreich, 1985) for growth of total aerobic bacteria and Brunner mineral medium supplemented with benzene (Vogt et\u00a0al., 2002) or into mineral salt medium (Rohwerder et\u00a0al., 2006) including vitamins, cobalt and MTBE for growth of specific degraders, respectively. For contaminant specific degraders, plates were incubated in gas-tight jars (Oxoid, United Kingdom) and 300\u00a0\u03bcl of pure benzene or MTBE was added to the gas phase. The first and last columns of the plates were filled with sterile media as controls, covered with sterile lids, and incubated at 27\u00a0\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using gas chromatography (GC), while the GC gene is not explicitly discussed. The context focuses on the methodology for analyzing contaminants like benzene and MTBE, without establishing a direct relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the GC gene, which may refer to genetic factors influencing gas chromatography processes or microbial degradation pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the analysis of VOCs, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
