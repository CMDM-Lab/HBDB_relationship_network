    "context": "But these inhibitory effects on MTBE biodegradation could not be observed in both the filters during this study. Table 4 shows the presence of BTEX and other aromatic hydrocarbons in the influent groundwater with a mean concentration value and still a highly efficient MTBE-concentration reduction (93\u201398%) can be seen especially in the effluent of the PF during single-stage operation (Table 3). However, very little is known about the microbial community structure during the aerobic MTBE degradation in the presence of BTEX. The disappearance of MTBE metabolites, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF) indicated the potential of complete biodegradation within the filter systems. As can be seen in Table 4, the mean concentrations of TBA and TBF were remarkably decreased in the effluent of the RF and the PF system during the single-stage operation period and almost completely diminished or biodegraded after passing through the second filter (PF) during the multi-stage operation period.MTBE and benzene removal performances: multi-stage system The second operational period with a multi-staged combined (RF\u00a0+\u00a0PF) vertical-flow soil filter system runs very well with a highly efficient MTBE and benzene removal. Both MTBE and benzene effluent concentrations were always stable and well below the allowable limit value after the second treatment step. Moreover, the high HLR in the first filter (RF) was not accompanied by hydraulic or technical problems, such as clogging, overloading, etc., and it was thus very encouraging to a further increase of HLR, which could reduce the cost of the required land for the filter construction.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to the biodegradation of MTBE and its metabolites, while the TERT gene is not directly referenced or discussed. The focus is on the microbial community structure and the efficiency of biodegradation processes, with no clear connection established between the chemical compound and the genetic aspect of TERT. Therefore, their relationship appears coincidental rather than significant.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the TERT gene, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
