    "context": "The detection limit for MTBE and benzene was 0.37 and 0.18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. The determination of detection and quantification limits of the calibration procedure was carried out in accordance with DIN 32645 (1994). Process control and data storage were carried out using the installed software (metaControl) that stored all the measurements and optional external signals on the hard disk of the attached PC. Known intermediate degradation products of MTBE, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), tert-butyl formate (TBF) and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, ethylbenzene, m-p-Xylene, o-Xylene, 1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4-Trimethylbenzene and Naphthalene were analysed in both influent groundwater and effluents from the filters by headspace gas chromatography and mass spectroscopic detection (HS-GC\u2013MS). For headspace analysis, aqueous samples (10\u00a0ml) were stirred for 60\u00a0min at 70\u00a0\u00b0C in headspace vials (20\u00a0ml) containing 2.5\u00a0g NaCl. Gas from the headspace (1\u00a0ml) was injected into a GC/MS (GC: Agilent 6890, MS: Agilent 5973) equipped with a 60\u00a0m HP1 column (Split injection 1:25, injection time 2\u00a0min). The time program was: 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0min, to 120\u00a0\u00b0C with 4\u00a0\u00b0C/min and to 280\u00a0\u00b0C with 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min, held at 280\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a chemical compound analyzed in relation to the degradation products of MTBE, while the TERT gene is not discussed or connected to the analysis. There is no indication of any relationship between the chemical properties of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the biological function of the TERT gene, which is typically associated with telomerase activity and cellular aging. Thus, their mention appears coincidental without any direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the TERT gene, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
