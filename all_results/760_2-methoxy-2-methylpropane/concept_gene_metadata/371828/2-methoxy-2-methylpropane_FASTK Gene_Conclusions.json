    "context": "However, no significant competition was present for the systems of Ambersorb 563 in STL water, and mordenite in the three natural waters. This may be attributed to the fact that NOM molecules were too large to enter the pores of the two adsorbents, and thus, the adsorption capacity of MTBE was not affected. The pore sizes of the adsorbents also affect the transport of MTBE into the adsorbents. A much faster adsorption kinetics of MTBE onto the two resins tested was observed compared to that onto the mordenite zeolite. The presence of NOM near aperture entrances of mordenite may reduce the number of transport paths for MTBE and slow the adsorption kinetics for MTBE in natural waters. Although the adsorption equilibrium was influenced by the presence of NOM, for the adsorbents tested, the IAST-EBC model successfully predicted the adsorption capacity of MTBE in natural waters under different initial concentrations. When combined the IAST-EBC model with the pore diffusion and micropore diffusion model for describing the transport of MTBE into the carbonaceous resins and mordenite zeolite, respectively, the models excellently predicted the adsorption kinetics of the resins and zeolite employed in different water matrix.

        "summary": "In this context, there is no direct relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the FASTK gene. The discussion focuses on the adsorption kinetics of MTBE in natural waters and the influence of NOM on this process, without any mention of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane's biological relevance or any connection to the FASTK gene, which is involved in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects the lack of any meaningful connection between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the FASTK gene in the provided context. They are mentioned in separate discussions without any interaction or relevance to each other.",
