    "context": "137,141,143,144 However, the associations are not very strong, so LTE4 cannot be considered a surrogate for these other measures. Practicality and risk Whereas collection of urine is simple and of no risk to study participants, the measurement of LTE4 is not simple. Special equipment and training are required to conduct the recommended measurement approach of mass spectroscopy. 128 Demographic considerations Higher urinary LTE4 levels are seen in adult-onset severe asthma and aspirin-sensitive asthma. 137,143 Priority for NIH-initiated clinical research Urinary LTE4 is recommended as a supplemental outcome for the characterization of study populations, for prospective clinical trials, and for observational studies. The test should be strongly considered for inclusion in any study that attempts to manipulate the eicosanoid pathway. LTE4 measurement also should be considered for studies that characterize asthma phenotypes, such as aspirin-sensitive, adult-onset, and eosinophilic asthma. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is associated with asthma, particularly in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and adult-onset severe asthma. Higher urinary levels of LTE4 are noted in these populations, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for characterizing asthma phenotypes. The measurement of LTE4 is recommended for studies focusing on the eicosanoid pathway and asthma characterization.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTE4 and aspirin-sensitive asthma, supported by evidence of higher LTE4 levels in specific asthma phenotypes. This indicates a clear relevance in understanding asthma mechanisms, although the context does not provide extensive quantitative data.",
