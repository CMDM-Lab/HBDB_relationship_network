    "context": "Children were randomized either to active FP (100 \u03bcg twice daily administered by means of the Diskus device; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) with montelukast placebo or to active montelukast (5 or 10 mg) by mouth nightly (based on age recommendations) with FP placebo for an 8-week period, at which time they were crossed over and treated for a second 8-week period. Asthma outcomes, including FEV1 and asthma control days (ACDs), were collected at randomization and every 4 weeks subsequently. PACT was a parallel randomized study of 285 children (aged 6-14 years) with mild-to-moderate asthma. Asthma outcome data, FENO values, and urine for LTE4 were collected (1 sample per child) during a 2- to 4-week baseline characterization period and measured as described previously. 7,8 Children were randomized to one of 3 treatment arms (95 children in each arm): active FP (100 \u03bcg twice daily by means of Diskus), active montelukast (5 mg by mouth nightly), or active combination FP (100 \u03bcg plus 50 \u03bcg of salmeterol each morning by means of Diskus) and salmeterol (50 \u03bcg nightly by means of Diskus) with appropriate placebos. Children were treated for 12 months, with asthma control indices collected every 6 weeks. For this analysis, only the FP and montelukast arms were evaluated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is measured as a biomarker in children with mild-to-moderate asthma during a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of treatments like fluticasone propionate (FP) and montelukast. The study collects asthma outcome data alongside LTE4 levels to evaluate the relationship between leukotriene levels and asthma control, indicating that LTE4 may play a role in asthma pathophysiology and treatment response.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTE4 and asthma, as LTE4 levels are directly measured in relation to asthma outcomes in a clinical trial. This suggests a clear relationship, although the exact mechanistic role of LTE4 in asthma management is not fully detailed.",
        "score": 4
