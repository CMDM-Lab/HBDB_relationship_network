    "context": "Thus, cysteinyl-leukotrienes are established as the major mediators of both the EAR and the LAR. 13,14,29,30 Furthermore, glucocorticosteroids inhibit the allergen-induced airway obstruction to a similar, although not identical, degree as leukotriene antagonism. 15 Thus, single doses of ICSs have less effect on the EAR than leukotriene antagonists, and their effect is more prominent on the LAR. Nevertheless, using the same dose (500 \u03bcg bid) and duration of fluticasone treatment, O'Shaughnessy et al 8 showed that both the allergen-induced EAR and LAR were profoundly inhibited, and this inhibition was not associated with a reduction in allergen-induced urinary LTE4 excretion. We therefore hypothesized that the protective effect of fluticasone in the allergen challenge might relate to inhibition of the actions of cysteinyl-leukotrienes, rather than to inhibition of their formation. In another allergen challenge study, Leigh et al 15 demonstrated significant attenuation of the EAR and LAR afforded by the antileukotriene, montelukast, and the ICS, budesonide, but the 2 treatments in combination were not additive, also suggesting a common target of action for both interventions, such as the leukotriene pathway. The findings in this study, however, argue against the possibility that at least part of the effects of ICSs on EAR and LAR relate to blockade of the actions of cysteinyl-leukotrienes in the airways.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to its role as a mediator in allergic responses, particularly in the early and late asthmatic reactions (EAR and LAR). The study highlights that urinary excretion of LTE4 is not reduced despite the inhibition of airway obstruction by glucocorticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists. This suggests that while LTE4 is involved in the inflammatory response, its excretion may not directly correlate with the excretory function in the context of airway inflammation and treatment efficacy.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTE4 is linked to excretory function through its urinary measurement, but the context primarily focuses on its role in mediating allergic responses rather than a direct functional relationship with excretory processes.",
