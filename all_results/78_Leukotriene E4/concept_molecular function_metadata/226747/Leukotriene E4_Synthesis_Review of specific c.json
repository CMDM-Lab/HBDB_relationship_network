    "context": "Mass spectroscopy is recommended as the method of measurement. 128,129 Medical and scientific value Urinary LTE4 is an indirect marker of lung cysteinyl leukotriene activity. Urinary LTE4 increases with asthma exacerbations, aspirin and allergen challenges, and perhaps at night with nocturnal asthma. 130-133 Drugs that block cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis significantly decrease urinary LTE4 levels, 134,135 whereas corticosteroids do not. 131,136 Levels have been shown to be greater in individuals with severe asthma whose disease onset occurs after 12 years of age, as compared to those with early onset, perhaps due to the more eosinophilic nature of some phenotypes of adult onset asthma, including aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. 137 Range of values Values can vary dramatically, depending on methodology. However, both 2-step purification methods (using immunopreciptation and enzyme linked immunoassays) and mass spectroscopy have generally established normal levels to be less than 50 pg/\u03bcg (picograms per micrograms) creatinine.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed as a marker of lung cysteinyl leukotriene activity, with its synthesis being influenced by various factors such as asthma exacerbations and drug interventions. The synthesis of LTE4 is notably reduced by drugs that block cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis, indicating a direct relationship between LTE4 levels and its synthesis pathways. This suggests that understanding LTE4 synthesis is crucial for evaluating its role in asthma and related conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Leukotriene E4 and its synthesis, as the context discusses how drug interventions affect LTE4 levels, indicating a clear relationship within the framework of asthma management.",
