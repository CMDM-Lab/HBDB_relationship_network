    "context": "Instead, this biological phenotype may indicate the limited benefit of montelukast when CysLTs as well as conventional eosinophil-related mediators are increased in the airway (measurable by higher mean LTE4 and FENO levels) because of the overlapping effects of multiple mediators. In contrast, when CysLTs are secreted into a more pristine inflammatory milieu with relatively low levels of FENO-related mediators (measurable by higher mean LTE4 and lower FENO levels), attenuating the effects of CysLTs with montelukast may lead to clinically significant improvement. We speculate that this is the case in children with asthma who are repeatedly exposed to ETS as their primary asthma trigger. In this context, studies have reported both that urinary LTE4 excretion increases acutely after tobacco smoking 30 and that levels of FENO are lower in schoolchildren with chronic ETS exposure. 31,32 Future studies are planned to assess directly the association between ETS exposure and levels of LTE4, FENO, and albuterol usage with acute and chronic exposure models. The observations in this study have a number of clinical applications. Although ICSs are generally considered more potent than LTRAs and are therefore recommended as first-line therapy, 33 treatment with ICS alone may not adequately control disease in 30% to 40% of patients.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to its excretion levels, particularly in the context of asthma and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Increased urinary LTE4 excretion is noted as a response to tobacco smoking, indicating a potential link between LTE4 levels and excretory function. The study suggests that monitoring LTE4 could provide insights into inflammatory responses and asthma management, particularly in children exposed to ETS.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTE4 and excretory function, as LTE4 levels are measured in urine and linked to inflammatory responses in asthma. The context provides evidence of increased LTE4 excretion due to environmental factors, indicating a clear relationship.",
