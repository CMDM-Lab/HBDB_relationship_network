    "context": "In previous studies, mean differences in LTE4 levels alone did not consistently predict the presence of asthma 25 or associate with asthma severity. 26 Similarly, in this study, susceptibility was not related to differences between children in mean LTE4 levels unless mean FENO levels were concurrently low. Other studies in schoolchildren with mild to moderate asthma have reported that FENO levels are well correlated with classical inflammatory markers related to the allergic response such as peripheral blood eosinophil IgE and serum eosinophil cationic protein and weakly correlated with levels of urinary LTE4, indicating that CysLTs may be elevated independent of conventional steroid-responsive eosinophilic inflammation measured by FENO. 27 In the current study, children with low FENO relative to urine LTE4 levels demonstrated significant associations between LTE4 and albuterol usage during the baseline interval and significant attenuation of these associations during montelukast treatment in a similar fashion as observed in sex-stratified and cotinine-stratified groupings. However, between-group interactions were weaker in this analysis, possibly because of the increased variability in ratio measurements instead of a single outcome. If confirmed in a larger context, the magnitude of the differences between groups indicates a large effect modification on CysLT responsiveness related to this biological pattern. Studies in school-age children by Szefler et al 7 and Zeiger et al 20 provide additional support for this interaction pattern, because increased montelukast responsiveness relative to ICS was reported among children with high LTE4 levels, whereas relatively poor responses to montelukast were observed in children with high IgE, eosinophil cationic protein, and FENO levels.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is associated with the attenuation of asthma symptoms, particularly in children undergoing montelukast treatment. The study indicates that higher LTE4 levels correlate with increased albuterol usage, but this association diminishes during montelukast treatment, suggesting that montelukast may effectively reduce LTE4's impact on asthma severity. This highlights the role of LTE4 in modulating asthma responses and the potential for montelukast to attenuate these effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTE4 and attenuation of asthma symptoms, supported by evidence of montelukast's effect on LTE4-related responses. The context provides quantitative data on treatment effects, indicating a clear relationship in asthma management.",
