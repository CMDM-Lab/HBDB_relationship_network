    "context": "Although ICSs are generally considered more potent than LTRAs and are therefore recommended as first-line therapy, 33 treatment with ICS alone may not adequately control disease in 30% to 40% of patients. 34 This could reflect the inability of ICS therapy to reduce leukotriene production in certain patient subsets in which this pathway predominates. 35,36 Although the weight of evidence suggests that LABAs are superior to LTRAs in combination therapy, 37 some studies have reported that the addition of montelukast to ICS therapy is similar to LABAs in reducing symptoms and exacerbations of asthma. 38,39 In certain patients, the choice of montelukast may be warranted, particularly in school-age girls and children exposed to tobacco smoke; determination of LTE4 to FENO ratios may help predict responsiveness among these and other potentially susceptible groups. In contradistinction to studies that assess between-subject variability by using averaged outcome measurements, the panel design in this study with multiple repeated measurements is well suited to detect susceptible subgroups or individuals because within-subject exposure-response relationships can be determined with great precision. 40 This allowed for significant observations despite the small number of subjects. Nevertheless, the size of the sample did not allow for an analysis of the interacting variables to determine with confidence whether these were independent or covarying predictors. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to asthma treatment and the effectiveness of different therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) like montelukast. The mention of adjudication refers to the study's design, which allows for precise measurement of treatment responses in susceptible patient subgroups. While LTE4 levels may inform treatment choices, the term 'adjudication' is more about the study's methodology rather than a direct relationship with LTE4 itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between LTE4 and adjudication. LTE4 is relevant to asthma treatment, while adjudication pertains to the study's design for assessing treatment responses. Their relationship is not deeply explored, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction.",
