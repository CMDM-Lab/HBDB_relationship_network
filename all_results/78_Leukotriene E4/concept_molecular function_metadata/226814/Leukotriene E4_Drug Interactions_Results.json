    "context": "Declines in LTE4-related albuterol usage after montelukast treatment were significant (P = .01) among children with higher cotinine but not the lower cotinine quartile (P = .18 for low cotinine group), and the interaction between groups was significant (P = .04 for interaction between groups; Fig 1, B). Biomarkers During the baseline interval, LTE4 levels were significantly but weakly correlated with same-day FENO levels (r = 0.38 for placebo group, P = .0003; r = 0.27, P = .015 for the montelukast group). Mean LTE4 levels did not predict susceptibility, nor were any trends observed at baseline or after treatment. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to the effects of montelukast treatment on albuterol usage among children with varying cotinine levels. The study highlights a significant interaction between LTE4 levels and drug usage, suggesting that montelukast may influence the effectiveness of albuterol in patients with different LTE4 levels. However, the specific nature of drug interactions involving LTE4 is not deeply explored, limiting the understanding of its role in pharmacological contexts.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as LTE4 is linked to drug interactions through its relationship with montelukast and albuterol usage. However, the context does not provide extensive details on the mechanisms or broader implications of these interactions.",
        "score": 3
