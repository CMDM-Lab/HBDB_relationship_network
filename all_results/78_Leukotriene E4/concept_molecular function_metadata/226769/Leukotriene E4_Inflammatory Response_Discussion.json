    "context": "Previous studies have assessed the utility of individual biomarkers, such as urinary LTE4 and FENO, to delineate heterogeneous patient profiles of inflammation that might respond differently to medications. These studies and the data presented here suggest that higher LTE4 values might be related to either montelukast or FP therapy responsiveness (although these patterns were not consistently observed), whereas FENO values were associated with FP response only. In contrast, LTE4/FENO ratios were associated with a better response to montelukast than FP therapy. As such, we speculate that urinary LTE4 is a more general indicator of the inflammatory response to multiple triggers, whereas allergic-type triggers specifically increase FENO values. In this context high LTE4/FENO ratios were related to a lower degree of IgE sensitization, lower levels of eosinophilic markers, and less responsiveness to ICS treatment while retaining sensitivity to LTRA therapy. This phenotype might be related to nonallergic asthma triggers, such as tobacco smoke exposure, that might increase urinary LTE4 values 11 and decrease FENO concentrations. 12 In this context previous reports have suggested increased montelukast responsiveness in smokers 13 or in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is presented as a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response, particularly in relation to asthma and its treatment. Higher LTE4 levels may indicate a broader inflammatory response to various triggers, while its ratio with FENO suggests differing responses to therapies like montelukast and FP. The study implies that LTE4 serves as a general indicator of inflammation, potentially influenced by nonallergic triggers such as tobacco smoke, which can elevate LTE4 levels and alter treatment responsiveness.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between LTE4 and the inflammatory response, supported by evidence of LTE4's role as a biomarker for inflammation and its implications for treatment responses. The context provides quantitative associations and discusses the impact of various triggers on LTE4 levels.",
