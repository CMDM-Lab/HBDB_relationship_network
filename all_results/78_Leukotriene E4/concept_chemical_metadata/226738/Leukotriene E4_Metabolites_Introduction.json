    "context": "Elevated concentrations of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1, a marker of oxidative stress, have been reported in inflammatory respiratory diseases, including asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis, and in healthy smokers. Therefore, measurements of these mediators are considered potentially effective in the establishment of asthma diagnosis in a large cohort. Leukotrienes are derived from arachidonic acid, which is also the precursor of prostaglandins (Fig. 1 ). There are two families of leukotrienes (LTB4 and cys LTs \u2013 LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and metabolites of LTE4 \u2013 leukotriene F4 (LTF4) and N-acetyl leukotriene E4 (N-acetyl-LTE4)). LTB4 acts primarily when the inflammation is dependent on neutrophils such as cystic fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. The second group (cys LTs) is concerned especially with eosinophil and mast cell induced bronchoconstriction in asthma. They bind to highly selective receptors on bronchial smooth muscle and other airway tissue. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is identified as a member of the cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are metabolites derived from arachidonic acid. The text discusses LTE4 and its metabolites, such as leukotriene F4 (LTF4) and N-acetyl leukotriene E4, highlighting their roles in inflammatory respiratory diseases like asthma and cystic fibrosis. This indicates a direct relationship where LTE4 is a specific metabolite involved in inflammatory processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Leukotriene E4 and its metabolites, as the context provides clear evidence of LTE4 being a metabolite with specific roles in inflammation, particularly in respiratory diseases. The relationship is well-supported by the discussion of their biological functions.",
        "score": 4
