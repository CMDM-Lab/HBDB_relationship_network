    "context": "For the quantification and detection of biomarkers, a highly selective and sensitive method by UHPLC\u2013ESI-MS/MS was applied. For its extremely high degree of selectivity, the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used together with stable-isotope dilution assay for its high precision of quantification. The analytical procedure was optimized, validated and analytically tested on real EBC, urine and plasma samples collected from patients diagnosed with bronchial asthma and on the control group of healthy subjects. Chemicals and reagents All chemicals and reagents were of commercial origin and the source was as follows: mixture of cys LTs contains LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, LTF4 and N-acetyl-LTE4 (purity of each individual substance \u226598%, Cayman Chemical, USA), cys LTs monoclonal antibody (=anti-cys LTs) developed in mouse (Abcam, UK), LTC4 polyclonal antibody developed in rabbit (Bretin Pharma, France), LTD4 polyclonal antibody developed in rabbit (Bretin Pharma, France), LTE4 polyclonal antibody developed in rabbit (Bretin Pharma, France), 5S-hydroxy-6R-(S-glutathionyl)-7E,9E,11Z,14Z-d 5-eicocatetraenoic-19,19,20,20,20-d 5 acid (= LTC4-d 5) (\u226597%, \u226599% deuterated form, Cayman Chemical, USA), 5S-hydroxy-6R-(S-cysteinylglycinyl)-7E,9E,11Z,14Z-d 5-eicocatetraenoic-19,19,20,20,20-d 5 acid (=LTD4-d 5) (\u226597%, \u226599% deuterated form, Cayman Chemical, USA), 5S-hydroxy-6R-(S-cysteinyl)-7E,9E,11Z,14Z-d 5-eicocatetraenoic-19,19,20,20,20-d 5 acid (=LTE4-d 5) (\u226597%, \u226599% deuterated form, Cayman Chemical, USA), acetonitrile (LC/MS grade, Fluka, Switzerland), water (LC/MS grade, Fluka, Switzerland), ammonium hydroxide (28% NH3 solution in water, Penta, Czech Republic), formic acid (LC\u2013MS grade, Fisher Chemical, USA), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (\u226599%, Fluka, Switzerland), sodium phosphate dibasic dihydrate (\u226599.5%, Riedel de Ha\u00ebn, Germany), sodium chloride (99%, Aldrich, USA), potassium chloride (99%, Penta, Czech Republic), sodium phosphate (99%, Riedel de Ha\u00ebn, Germany), urea (99%, Aldrich, USA), bovine serum albumin (=BSA) (fraction V, Sigma, USA), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethan (=Tris) (99.9%, Aldrich, USA), hydrochloric acid (p.a., Penta, Czech Republic), glycine (99%, Aldrich, USA), sodium azide (99%, Aldrich, USA) and Tween 20 (99%, Cayman Chemical, USA). The following buffers were used: Buffer A: 0.1M Na\u2013phosphate buffer pH 7.4 (0.262g NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O and 1.442g Na2HPO4\u00b72H2O was dissolved in water and volume adjusted to 100ml); Buffer B: phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 with 0.1% (w/v) BSA (0.88g NaCl and 0.8g BSA was dissolved in 0.01M Na\u2013phosphate pH 7.4 and volume was adjusted to 100ml); Buffer C: 0.2M Tris (2.42g) with 0.1% (w/v) BSA was dissolved in distilled water, pH was adjusted with 1M hydrochloric acid to 8.5 and volume was adjusted to 100ml.

        "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is mentioned as part of a mixture of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys LTs) used in a highly selective and sensitive analytical method for quantifying biomarkers in biological samples from asthma patients. The term 'chemicals' broadly encompasses the various reagents and substances, including LTE4, utilized in the study, indicating that LTE4 is one of the specific chemicals analyzed. However, the relationship is primarily about LTE4 being a component of a larger group of chemicals used for analysis rather than a detailed interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as LTE4 is included in a list of chemicals used in the study, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or roles beyond being one of the chemicals analyzed.",
