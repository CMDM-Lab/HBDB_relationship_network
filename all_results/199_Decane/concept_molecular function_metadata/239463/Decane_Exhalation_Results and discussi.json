    "context": "The methylated alkanes family have also been previously reported as these may well be important in asthma characterization. These compounds also have an important role in diseases, in which oxidative stress apparently may be involved, but to other extents, and with different consequences than asthma, such as lung and breast cancer, as well as in lung cancer cell lines [65\u201367]. These compounds have been reported in literature in other exhaled breath studies associated to pathological states of the lungs, but as individual markers. For example, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane and decane were identified and compared by Poli et al. in exhaled breath of patients with non-small lung cancer (NSLC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smokers and controls and their concentrations were higher for NSLC, COPD and smokers when compared to controls. Dodecane has been proposed as lung cancer markers. These results evidence that overall, for the allergic asthma group, there is a greater weight of the alkanes confirming the previous study whereas aldehydes have a major importance in the characterization of the control group. Alkanes, in the sequence of oxidation reactions, are end-compounds that have been associated to oxidative stress and inflammation processes and the hypothesis formed is that these compounds indicate that the oxidative state is at a higher extent in asthmatics when compared to controls leading to the obtained differences and consequently the alkanes can be associated to allergic asthma.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as a methylated alkane found in exhaled breath, particularly in patients with non-small lung cancer (NSLC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and smokers. The study highlights that the concentration of decane in exhaled breath is significantly higher in these pathological states compared to controls, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for lung diseases. This indicates a direct relationship between decane and exhalation, as the presence of decane in breath samples is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation processes in the lungs.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and exhalation, supported by evidence of its higher concentrations in the breath of patients with lung diseases. This suggests that decane may serve as a biomarker for these conditions, indicating its relevance in the context of respiratory health.",
