    "context": "This therapy combination directed to block the effects of histamine and leukotriene mediators was performed as it is shown that it is better than stand-alone therapy. The behaviour of a naive child was monitored throughout 24 days (Fig. 5A, marked by the path trajectory). Initially and after 18 days after the intake of the prescribed drugs, the naive individual remains in LV1 positive values but far from the remaining controlled subjects. There is an evolution throughout LV1 axis with treatment administration explained by the area reduction of nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, 3,6-dimethyldecane, and tetradecane. Considering that asthma crisis is mainly characterized by inflammation, which is accompanied by oxidative stress and subsequently lipid peroxidation, and that alkanes are evidence of these biochemical processes, the observed decrease may be due to a lesser inflammation state of this subject leading to lower areas of these compounds. Clinically, the child in the initial stages was in a crisis situation almost in a daily basis and throughout the 24 days there was a significant improvement of the asthma status control. As verified, the obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the distinction between allergic asthmatic and control children which could be helpful in understanding this pathology through a better insight into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to this condition.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the alkanes whose area reduction correlates with the improvement in asthma symptoms in a child undergoing treatment. The evolution of the child's condition is tracked through changes in the levels of these compounds, suggesting that the decrease in decane levels may reflect a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress associated with asthma. This indicates a potential relationship between the metabolic changes of decane and the evolution of the child's health status over the treatment period.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and the evolution of the child's asthma condition, supported by evidence of reduced levels of decane correlating with improved health outcomes. The context provides a clear link between the biochemical changes and the clinical evolution of the patient's condition.",
