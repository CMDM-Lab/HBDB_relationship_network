    "context": "3.2.8 Varsol\u2122 removal As stated in the objectives section, measurement of the Varsol\u2122 removal objective was to be based on the average removal of three Varsol\u2122 marker compounds: decane, undecane and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (commonly called mesitylene). The Varsol\u2122 removal objective would be met when weekly averages of Varsol\u2122 removal exceeded 95% at the end of the pervaporation treatment project as surfactant concentrations declined during the post-SEAR water flood. Based on the surfactant partitioning behavior of these compounds, it was expected that they would be harder to remove than PCE from a surfactant solution and the removal would decrease according to the following series: 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene>decane>undecane. Prior to surfactant breakthrough, concentrations of all three Varsol\u2122 markers were below the 0.005mg/l threshold reporting value of the GC/MS method employed. During the surfactant plateau region (days 28\u201370), concentrations ranged from 0.8 to 1.8mg/l for decane and 0.5 to 1.4mg/l for undecane \u2014 two to three orders of magnitude lower than PCE concentrations. Concentrations of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene never exceeded the 0.5mg/l threshold reporting value established for the GC/MS method with surfactant solutions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the marker compounds in the removal process of Varsol\u2122 using chemical surfactants. The study discusses the partitioning behavior of decane in relation to surfactant concentrations, indicating that its removal is expected to be less efficient compared to other compounds like 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. The relationship highlights the role of chemical surfactants in the removal of decane from a surfactant solution, suggesting a significant interaction in the context of environmental remediation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between decane and chemical surfactants, as the context provides evidence of their interaction during the removal process, supported by quantitative data on concentration levels and expected removal efficiency.",
