    "context": "FID chromatograms of the Boulder air standard, given in Fig. 6 , show only minor differences between the two experiments. Percent recovery data of all the compounds studied are given in Fig. 7 . From this figure it can be seen that some lighter compounds (retention index less than 500) are not fully recovered. The non-methane hydrocarbons propane, methyl propane, butane and methylbutane had significant losses, while pentane through decane did not. CFC-12 and CFC-11 also suffered losses under humid sampling conditions. The biogenic compounds isoprene, MACR, MVK, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and limonene were fully recovered. There was rearrangement between \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene (i.e. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and methane are both mentioned as components of a study analyzing the recovery of various hydrocarbons in air samples. However, the focus is primarily on the recovery rates of lighter hydrocarbons, with no specific discussion of the relationship or interaction between decane and methane. They are simply categorized as non-methane hydrocarbons, indicating they are part of a broader analysis without direct relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as decane and methane are mentioned in the context of a study on hydrocarbon recovery but without any direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them.",
