    "context": "FID chromatograms of the Boulder air standard, given in Fig. 6 , show only minor differences between the two experiments. Percent recovery data of all the compounds studied are given in Fig. 7 . From this figure it can be seen that some lighter compounds (retention index less than 500) are not fully recovered. The non-methane hydrocarbons propane, methyl propane, butane and methylbutane had significant losses, while pentane through decane did not. CFC-12 and CFC-11 also suffered losses under humid sampling conditions. The biogenic compounds isoprene, MACR, MVK, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and limonene were fully recovered. There was rearrangement between \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene (i.e. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and butane are both mentioned as non-methane hydrocarbons analyzed in the Boulder air standard. However, the discussion focuses on the recovery rates of various compounds during the experiments, with no specific interaction or relationship between decane and butane highlighted. They are simply part of a broader analysis of hydrocarbon recovery without direct relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as decane and butane are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or functional relationship discussed. They appear coincidentally in the analysis of hydrocarbon recovery.",
