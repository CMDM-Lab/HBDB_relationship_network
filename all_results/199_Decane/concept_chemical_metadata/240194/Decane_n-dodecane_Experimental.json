Stock solutions of pure compounds were made in methanol; dilutions of 1\u201310 \u03bcg/ml in water were used to identify the compounds. A volume (1 ml) of the diluted solution of the pure compounds was placed in a headspace glass sealed vial and analysed by SPME\u2013GC as described below for packaging samples.Instruments and materials A Varian 3900 gas chromatograph with a Varian Saturn 2100T MS detector was used for the identification of volatile compounds and for the analysis of packaging samples and raw materials. The extraction of compounds was performed manually with an SPME holder from Supelco, together with a hot plate from Corning and a metal support for eight vials of 15-ml. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and n-dodecane are mentioned as part of a list of pure compounds sourced from Aldrich for use in a study involving gas chromatography analysis. Both are aliphatic hydrocarbons, but their relationship is limited to their inclusion in the same inventory of chemicals without any specific interaction or functional relevance discussed in the context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as decane and n-dodecane are simply listed together among other compounds without any indication of interaction, comparison, or relevance to a specific study or application.",
