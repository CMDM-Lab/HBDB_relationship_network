Stock solutions of pure compounds were made in methanol; dilutions of 1\u201310 \u03bcg/ml in water were used to identify the compounds. A volume (1 ml) of the diluted solution of the pure compounds was placed in a headspace glass sealed vial and analysed by SPME\u2013GC as described below for packaging samples.Instruments and materials A Varian 3900 gas chromatograph with a Varian Saturn 2100T MS detector was used for the identification of volatile compounds and for the analysis of packaging samples and raw materials. The extraction of compounds was performed manually with an SPME holder from Supelco, together with a hot plate from Corning and a metal support for eight vials of 15-ml. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a chemical compound among a list of other aldehydes and acids, with a specified purity of +99%. However, there is no discussion of its properties, functions, or interactions with other compounds. The mention of decane appears to be purely coincidental, as it is listed alongside other chemicals without any further elaboration on its significance or relationship to them.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as decane is simply listed among other chemicals without any context or discussion regarding its relevance or interaction with other substances.",
