    "context": "The mean indoor benzene concentration (103.4 \u03bcg/m3) was six times higher than ambient air quality standards of 16 \u03bcg/m3 (UKNAQS, 1997). Though the mean concentration of toluene was relatively high (61.1 \u03bcg/m3) in indoor environment, the ranges observed in outdoor environment were not significantly different than that of indoor. This indicates relatively low addition to the flux of toluene due to indoor sources. The indoor to outdoor concentration ratios (I/O) for heptane and n-decane may appear to be significantly high (9.8 and 11.6), however, their concentrations were low in both indoor and outdoor samples.TSPM and benzene soluble organics Table 4 summarises the data on TSPM and benzene soluble organics in samples collected from three different houses in Trombay, Mumbai where kerosene is used as cooking fuel. Data on the same in an outdoor environment from the same locations collected simultaneously is also included in the table. Concentrations of TSPM and benzene soluble organics are significantly higher in indoor samples compared to the outdoor. The indoor TSPM ranged from 154.8\u20131499.0 ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and heptanes are both mentioned as components of indoor air quality assessments, specifically regarding their concentrations in indoor versus outdoor environments. The indoor to outdoor concentration ratios for heptane and n-decane are noted to be significantly high, indicating that these compounds may be more prevalent indoors. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific chemical interactions or biological implications between decane and heptanes, focusing instead on their environmental concentrations.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and heptanes are both discussed in relation to indoor air quality but lack a detailed connection or interaction beyond their presence in the same environmental study.",
        "score": 2
