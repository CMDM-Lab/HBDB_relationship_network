    "context": "Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. Hydrogen flow rate for FID was 30 ml/min. The analytical conditions were optimised to get a proper resolution of the peaks of seven hydrocarbons, viz. n-hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, p- and o-xylene and n-decane. For the analysis of blanks, nitrogen filled tedlar bags were taken to sampling sites, brought back and subjected to entire preconcentration procedure. The absence of any hydrocarbon indicated that the entire sampling and analysis line was free from contamination. Calibration was performed by preparing synthetic mixtures of C6\u2013C10 hydrocarbons in 0\u2013100 parts per billion (ppb) range in a tedlar bag using Supelco standards. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and toluene are both mentioned as components of a mixture of hydrocarbons analyzed for their resolution in a chromatographic method. However, there is no discussion of their specific interactions, properties, or relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the same analytical procedure. They are simply part of a list of hydrocarbons being studied.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as decane and toluene are only mentioned together in the context of a chromatographic analysis without any direct interaction or functional relationship discussed.",
