    "context": "The mean indoor benzene concentration (103.4 \u03bcg/m3) was six times higher than ambient air quality standards of 16 \u03bcg/m3 (UKNAQS, 1997). Though the mean concentration of toluene was relatively high (61.1 \u03bcg/m3) in indoor environment, the ranges observed in outdoor environment were not significantly different than that of indoor. This indicates relatively low addition to the flux of toluene due to indoor sources. The indoor to outdoor concentration ratios (I/O) for heptane and n-decane may appear to be significantly high (9.8 and 11.6), however, their concentrations were low in both indoor and outdoor samples.TSPM and benzene soluble organics Table 4 summarises the data on TSPM and benzene soluble organics in samples collected from three different houses in Trombay, Mumbai where kerosene is used as cooking fuel. Data on the same in an outdoor environment from the same locations collected simultaneously is also included in the table. Concentrations of TSPM and benzene soluble organics are significantly higher in indoor samples compared to the outdoor. The indoor TSPM ranged from 154.8\u20131499.0 ",

        "summary": "In this context, both 'Decane' and 'decane' refer to the same chemical compound, a straight-chain alkane with ten carbon atoms. The mention of decane occurs in the discussion of indoor and outdoor air quality, specifically regarding its concentration levels. However, there is no detailed exploration of its properties, effects, or interactions with other substances, indicating a lack of significant relationship beyond its identification as a compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 'Decane' and 'decane' are simply two instances of the same term without any additional context or discussion of their relevance or interaction in the provided text.",
