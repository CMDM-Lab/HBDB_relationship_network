    "context": "Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. Hydrogen flow rate for FID was 30 ml/min. The analytical conditions were optimised to get a proper resolution of the peaks of seven hydrocarbons, viz. n-hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, p- and o-xylene and n-decane. For the analysis of blanks, nitrogen filled tedlar bags were taken to sampling sites, brought back and subjected to entire preconcentration procedure. The absence of any hydrocarbon indicated that the entire sampling and analysis line was free from contamination. Calibration was performed by preparing synthetic mixtures of C6\u2013C10 hydrocarbons in 0\u2013100 parts per billion (ppb) range in a tedlar bag using Supelco standards. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and heptanes are both mentioned as part of a group of hydrocarbons analyzed using gas chromatography. They are included in a synthetic mixture of C6\u2013C10 hydrocarbons for calibration purposes. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or relationships beyond their classification as hydrocarbons in the analytical procedure.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as decane and heptanes are grouped together in the context of hydrocarbon analysis but lack any direct interaction or functional relationship detailed in the study.",
        "score": 2
