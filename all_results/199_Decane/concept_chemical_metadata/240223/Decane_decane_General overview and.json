    "context": "Varsol\u2122 is a hydrocarbon-based dry cleaning solvent which was used at the facility prior to PCE. Varsol\u2122 components are present in the DNAPL at concentrations 2\u20134 orders of magnitude lower than PCE. Measurement of the PCE removal objective was based on weekly averages of PCE removal for the duration of the demonstration. Measurement of the Varsol\u2122 removal objective was based on the average removals of three Varsol\u2122 marker compounds: decane, undecane and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. It was expected that the Varsol\u2122 removal objective would be met when weekly averages of Varsol\u2122 removal exceed 95% at the end of the pervaporation treatment project as surfactant concentrations declined during the post-SEAR water flood. 1.1.1 The process (mention of trade names, vendors, or commercial products does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation for use) In pervaporation, as applied in this project, a liquid stream containing VOCs is placed in contact with one side of a non-porous polymeric membrane while a vacuum or gas purge is applied to the other side.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the marker compounds for the hydrocarbon-based dry cleaning solvent Varsol\u2122. The study focuses on the removal of various compounds, including decane, during a pervaporation treatment project aimed at reducing concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship is primarily based on decane's role as a measurable component in the removal objectives for Varsol\u2122.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane is included in the context as a marker compound for removal objectives but lacks detailed discussion on its specific interactions or significance beyond being part of a mixture.",
