    "context": "Varsol\u2122 is a hydrocarbon-based dry cleaning solvent which was used at the facility prior to PCE. Varsol\u2122 components are present in the DNAPL at concentrations 2\u20134 orders of magnitude lower than PCE. Measurement of the PCE removal objective was based on weekly averages of PCE removal for the duration of the demonstration. Measurement of the Varsol\u2122 removal objective was based on the average removals of three Varsol\u2122 marker compounds: decane, undecane and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. It was expected that the Varsol\u2122 removal objective would be met when weekly averages of Varsol\u2122 removal exceed 95% at the end of the pervaporation treatment project as surfactant concentrations declined during the post-SEAR water flood. 1.1.1 The process (mention of trade names, vendors, or commercial products does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation for use) In pervaporation, as applied in this project, a liquid stream containing VOCs is placed in contact with one side of a non-porous polymeric membrane while a vacuum or gas purge is applied to the other side.

        "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are identified as marker compounds of Varsol\u2122, a hydrocarbon-based dry cleaning solvent. Both compounds are part of the measurement objectives for assessing the removal efficiency of Varsol\u2122 during a pervaporation treatment project. Their presence indicates a shared role in evaluating the solvent's environmental impact, but no direct interaction or functional relationship between them is discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as decane and undecane are both mentioned as components of Varsol\u2122 used in the same context, but their relationship lacks detailed discussion or specific interactions.",
