    "context": "PCE concentrations ranged from 35 to 890mg/l while surfactant concentrations ranged from 0 to 1.2wt.%. Concentrations of hydrocarbon secondary contaminants (Varsol\u2122 compounds) were significantly lower than PCE concentrations at all times. Varsol\u2122 marker concentrations in all samples were below detection limits in the absence of surfactant, thus making quantification of removal impossible. In the presence of surfactant, removal averaged 33% for undecane and 56% for decane, although, concentrations were generally near or below the method detection limits. Due to low concentrations of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene observed even in the presence of surfactant, removal of this compound could not be quantified, but would likely have been around 70% based on micellar partitioning behavior observed in laboratory tests. Likewise, in the absence of surfactant, Varsol\u2122 removal should have exceeded that of PCE, but was not quantifiable. As a result, whether the average 95% removal criteria was met for Varsol\u2122 could not be determined. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a hydrocarbon secondary contaminant whose removal was evaluated in the presence of surfactants. The study reports an average removal rate of 56% for decane, indicating its significance in the context of contaminant removal processes. However, the mention of decane is solely focused on its removal efficiency and does not explore any deeper chemical or biological interactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as decane is specifically analyzed for its removal efficiency in the context of surfactant use. While there is a clear connection to its role as a contaminant, the lack of broader biological or chemical interactions limits the depth of the relationship.",
