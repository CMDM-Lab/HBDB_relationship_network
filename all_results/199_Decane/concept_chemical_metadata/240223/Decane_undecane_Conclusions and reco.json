    "context": "PCE concentrations ranged from 35 to 890mg/l while surfactant concentrations ranged from 0 to 1.2wt.%. Concentrations of hydrocarbon secondary contaminants (Varsol\u2122 compounds) were significantly lower than PCE concentrations at all times. Varsol\u2122 marker concentrations in all samples were below detection limits in the absence of surfactant, thus making quantification of removal impossible. In the presence of surfactant, removal averaged 33% for undecane and 56% for decane, although, concentrations were generally near or below the method detection limits. Due to low concentrations of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene observed even in the presence of surfactant, removal of this compound could not be quantified, but would likely have been around 70% based on micellar partitioning behavior observed in laboratory tests. Likewise, in the absence of surfactant, Varsol\u2122 removal should have exceeded that of PCE, but was not quantifiable. As a result, whether the average 95% removal criteria was met for Varsol\u2122 could not be determined. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are both hydrocarbon compounds whose removal efficiencies were evaluated in the presence of surfactants. The study reports that undecane had an average removal rate of 33%, while decane had a higher removal rate of 56%. This indicates a comparative analysis of their effectiveness in a specific environmental remediation scenario, highlighting their functional relationship as secondary contaminants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and undecane, as their removal efficiencies are quantitatively compared in the context of surfactant presence. The data supports a clear relationship in terms of their behavior as contaminants, although the underlying mechanisms are not deeply explored.",
        "score": 4
