    "context": "Concentrations of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene never exceeded the 0.5mg/l threshold reporting value established for the GC/MS method with surfactant solutions. As with PCE concentrations, Varsol\u2122 concentrations were up to 10 times lower than had been expected based on model predictions. Since concentrations of Varsol\u2122 marker compounds were always near the threshold reporting value of the analytical method, calculations of Varsol\u2122 removal are less accurate and less precise than those for PCE. During the surfactant plateau region, decane removal averaged 56% and undecane removal averaged 33%. Based on the surfactant partitioning behavior of the Varsol\u2122 marker compounds (measured separately by headspace chromatography at USEPA facilities), it is estimated that removal of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene was likely around 70%. Average Varsol\u2122 removal would certainly have exceeded 95% in the absence of surfactant due to the high vapor\u2013liquid partitioning coefficients (Henry\u2019s law constant) observed for the Varsol\u2122 markers. Based on this vapor\u2013liquid partitioning information, Varsol\u2122 removal from water should exceed even that of PCE. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are both mentioned as compounds whose removal efficiencies were evaluated during a surfactant plateau region. Decane removal averaged 56%, while undecane removal averaged 33%. This indicates a comparative analysis of their removal rates, suggesting that both compounds are relevant in the study of surfactant interactions and removal processes, although their specific interactions are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as decane and undecane are compared in terms of their removal efficiencies in the context of surfactant behavior. However, there is no deeper exploration of their chemical interactions or significance beyond this comparative analysis.",
