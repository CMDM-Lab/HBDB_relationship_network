    "context": "Calculation of a i values based on Eq. (4) requires measurement of the retardation factor (R) of the interfacial tracer. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the tracers, obtained from gaseous displacement experiments, are used for the calculation of R values (Brusseau et al., 1997; Kim et al., 1999). Adsorption of n-decane at the soil surface is neglected because the water saturation achieved in this study was fairly high (S w >0.58) providing no direct contact between the gaseous phase and the surface of soil particles. Partitioning of n-decane into the aqueous phase was also not considered here due to extremely low water solubility of this chemical. The method of moments is used to determine R from the BTCs: (6) R = \u03bc i \u2032 \u03bc n \u2032 = t \u00af i t \u00af n where \u03bc i\u2032 and \u03bc n \u2032 are the normalized temporal first moments (min) of the BTCs of interfacial tracer and the non-reactive tracer, respectively. Note that the normalized temporal first moment of a tracer BTC is equivalent to the mean residence time, t\u00af (min), of the tracer in the medium during transport. (7) \u03bc \u2032 = \u222b 0 \u221e C \u2061 ( t ) t \u2062 d \u2062 t \u222b 0 \u221e C \u2061 ( t ) d \u2062 t \u2212 1 2 t p = t \u00af where \u03bc\u2032 is the normalized temporal first moment of tracer, C(t) is the concentration of tracer (mol/cm3), t is the elapsed time (min) after tracer injection, and t p is duration (min) of the pulse input of tracer.

        "summary": "In this context, the term 'decane' is mentioned as 'n-decane,' referring to a specific alkane with ten carbon atoms. The discussion focuses on the behavior of n-decane in gaseous displacement experiments and its interactions with soil, particularly regarding its adsorption and partitioning. However, there is no distinct relationship or interaction described between different forms of decane, as the term is used consistently to refer to the same compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 'decane' and 'n-decane' are essentially the same chemical compound, mentioned in a technical context without any discussion of differing properties or interactions. They appear coincidentally without any direct relevance.",
