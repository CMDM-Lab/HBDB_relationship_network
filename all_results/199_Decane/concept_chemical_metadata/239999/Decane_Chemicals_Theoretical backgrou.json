    "context": "Calculation of a i values based on Eq. (4) requires measurement of the retardation factor (R) of the interfacial tracer. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the tracers, obtained from gaseous displacement experiments, are used for the calculation of R values (Brusseau et al., 1997; Kim et al., 1999). Adsorption of n-decane at the soil surface is neglected because the water saturation achieved in this study was fairly high (S w >0.58) providing no direct contact between the gaseous phase and the surface of soil particles. Partitioning of n-decane into the aqueous phase was also not considered here due to extremely low water solubility of this chemical. The method of moments is used to determine R from the BTCs: (6) R = \u03bc i \u2032 \u03bc n \u2032 = t \u00af i t \u00af n where \u03bc i\u2032 and \u03bc n \u2032 are the normalized temporal first moments (min) of the BTCs of interfacial tracer and the non-reactive tracer, respectively. Note that the normalized temporal first moment of a tracer BTC is equivalent to the mean residence time, t\u00af (min), of the tracer in the medium during transport. (7) \u03bc \u2032 = \u222b 0 \u221e C \u2061 ( t ) t \u2062 d \u2062 t \u222b 0 \u221e C \u2061 ( t ) d \u2062 t \u2212 1 2 t p = t \u00af where \u03bc\u2032 is the normalized temporal first moment of tracer, C(t) is the concentration of tracer (mol/cm3), t is the elapsed time (min) after tracer injection, and t p is duration (min) of the pulse input of tracer.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a specific chemical involved in the study of gaseous displacement experiments and its interactions with soil. The text discusses the behavior of decane in relation to its low water solubility and its partitioning into different phases, indicating its relevance as a chemical in environmental studies. However, the relationship is primarily focused on decane's properties rather than a broader discussion of chemicals in general.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as decane is identified as a chemical with specific properties relevant to the study, but there is no detailed exploration of its relationship with other chemicals or a broader chemical context.",
        "score": 2
