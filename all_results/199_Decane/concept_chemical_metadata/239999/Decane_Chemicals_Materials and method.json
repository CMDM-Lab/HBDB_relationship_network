Materials A quartz sand with diameter range 200\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm was used as the porous medium. Reagent grade sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. and used as received. Saturated hydrocarbons, methane and n-decane with >99% purity were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further treatment. Double distilled (DI) water was used throughout the experiments.Experimental setup A schematic diagram of experimental set-up used in this study is shown in Fig. 1 . The length and inner diameter of the sand column were 81.0 and 5.25\u00a0cm, respectively. The bottom 3\u00a0cm of the sand column was packed with a coarse sand (diameter range 0.1\u20130.2 ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a saturated hydrocarbon with >99% purity, supplied for use in an experimental setup involving tracer injection in a porous medium. The term 'chemicals' broadly encompasses substances like decane, but there is no specific discussion of its interactions or relevance to other chemicals beyond its classification as a hydrocarbon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as decane is categorized as a chemical and is included in the list of materials used in the study. However, there is no detailed exploration of its specific interactions or significance within the broader context of chemicals.",
        "score": 2
