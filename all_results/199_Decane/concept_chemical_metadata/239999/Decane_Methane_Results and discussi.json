    "context": "Decreasing water saturation is believed to increase the contact area between aqueous phase that is contaminated with dissolved organic compounds and the mobile gaseous phase. For aquifers contaminated with NAPL, lowered water saturation may increase the fraction of NAPL exposed to the mobile air phase, enhancing the mass transfer rate from the NAPL to air. The reduction of surface tension of groundwater for better removal of NAPL from the aquifer using air sparging, may require careful optimization of the surfactant concentration to avoid unwanted mobilization of the NAPL due to decreased NAPL-groundwater interfacial tension.Air\u2013water interfacial area controlled by surface tension change The BTCs of gaseous interfacial tracer, n-decane, and the nonreactive tracer, methane, are shown in Fig. 4 . It is immediately clear that the gaseous n-decane was transported through the sand column at a slower linear velocity than methane due to the interfacial sorption at the air\u2013water interface. The retardation factors of n-decane at five different water saturations (Table 1) were calculated by analyzing the moments of the tracer BTCs using Eqs. (6) and (7). The a i values were then calculated using the sorption coefficient of n-decane (K ia) and Eq. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and methane are both mentioned as gaseous tracers in a study examining the transport of organic compounds through a sand column. The study highlights that n-decane is transported at a slower linear velocity compared to methane due to interfacial sorption at the air-water interface. This suggests a significant difference in their behavior in the environment, particularly in relation to mass transfer and sorption dynamics in contaminated aquifers.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and methane, as their transport behaviors are compared in the context of environmental contamination. The study provides evidence of their differing velocities and sorption characteristics, indicating a clear relationship within the context of mass transfer in aquifers.",
