    "context": "The retardation factors did not vary with water saturation change, meaning the a i value changed proportionally to the air saturation (Eq. (4)) resulting in a linear functional relationship between the calculated a i value and the water saturation (Fig. 5 ). This functional relationship verifies that decreasing water saturation induced by adding a water soluble surfactant prior to air sparging increases the air\u2013water contact area. The linear characteristics of the a i\u2013S w relationship measured in this study using n-decane, a gaseous interfacial tracer, are similar to those measured for sand using an aqueous interfacial tracer (anionic surfactant) (Kim et al., 1997). Note that the gaseous interfacial tracers in previous works were applied only at a low S w range and an exponential function rather than linear relationship was found to better fit the a i\u2013S w relationship (Kim et al., 1999). Thus it can be concluded that the a i\u2013S w relationship for unsaturated soils measured using gaseous interfacial tracer consists of two different functions, exponential (at low S w) and linear (at high S w). A series of surfactant-enhanced air sparging experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of reduced surface tension of water on the water saturation and air\u2013water interfacial area within the influence zone.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a gaseous interfacial tracer used to study the relationship between air saturation and water saturation in unsaturated soils. The study highlights the linear relationship between the calculated air interfacial value and water saturation, indicating decane's role in enhancing air-water contact area during surfactant-enhanced air sparging experiments. However, the mention of decane does not provide additional insights into its specific properties or interactions beyond its use as a tracer.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane is identified as a tracer in the study, but there is no detailed discussion of its chemical properties or interactions with other substances. Its role is primarily as a tool for measuring air-water relationships rather than a focus of the study.",
