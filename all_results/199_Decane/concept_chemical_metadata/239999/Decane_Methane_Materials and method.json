Materials A quartz sand with diameter range 200\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm was used as the porous medium. Reagent grade sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. and used as received. Saturated hydrocarbons, methane and n-decane with >99% purity were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further treatment. Double distilled (DI) water was used throughout the experiments.Experimental setup A schematic diagram of experimental set-up used in this study is shown in Fig. 1 . The length and inner diameter of the sand column were 81.0 and 5.25\u00a0cm, respectively. The bottom 3\u00a0cm of the sand column was packed with a coarse sand (diameter range 0.1\u20130.2 ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and methane are both mentioned as saturated hydrocarbons supplied for an experimental setup involving tracer injection in a porous medium. However, there is no discussion of their specific interactions, properties, or roles in the experiment beyond their classification as chemicals used in the study. They are simply listed as materials without any direct relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as decane and methane are only mentioned together as materials used in the experiment, with no further exploration of their interactions or significance in the context provided.",
