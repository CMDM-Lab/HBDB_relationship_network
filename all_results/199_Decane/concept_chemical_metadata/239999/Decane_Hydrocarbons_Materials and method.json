Materials A quartz sand with diameter range 200\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcm was used as the porous medium. Reagent grade sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd. and used as received. Saturated hydrocarbons, methane and n-decane with >99% purity were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co. and used without further treatment. Double distilled (DI) water was used throughout the experiments.Experimental setup A schematic diagram of experimental set-up used in this study is shown in Fig. 1 . The length and inner diameter of the sand column were 81.0 and 5.25\u00a0cm, respectively. The bottom 3\u00a0cm of the sand column was packed with a coarse sand (diameter range 0.1\u20130.2 ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a specific type of saturated hydrocarbon supplied for experimental purposes. Hydrocarbons are a broad category of organic compounds consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon, which includes decane as one of its members. The relationship is primarily categorical, with decane being a specific example of hydrocarbons used in the study, but no detailed interactions or implications are discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as decane is categorized under hydrocarbons. However, the context does not provide any detailed discussion of their relationship beyond this classification.",
        "score": 2
