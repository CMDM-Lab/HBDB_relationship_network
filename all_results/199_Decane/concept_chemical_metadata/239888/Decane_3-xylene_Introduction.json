    "context": "However, the assessment of dose\u2013response relationships is restricted in most of the models described. Recently we described a simple experimental model allowing the analysis of inflammatory effects of VOC over a wide concentration range (Wichmann et al., 2005). Primarily developed for the exposure of suspended cells, we have adapted this model for adherent cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially.

        "summary": "In this context, decane and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study examining various aliphatic and aromatic compounds. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative effects on inflammation, indicating they are part of a broader analysis rather than having a defined relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and 3-xylene are included in the same study on VOCs but lack a detailed discussion of their interactions or specific roles in the inflammatory response.",
        "score": 2
