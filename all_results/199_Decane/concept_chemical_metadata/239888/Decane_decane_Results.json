    "context": "The lower limit of detection for all cytokines and chemokines was <4pg/ml. Results were expressed as the percentage of cytokine or chemokine release compared to those of control cultures exposed to the solvent without VOC (% cytokine/chemokine release=100%\u00d7mean cytokine/chemokine concentration VOC/mean cytokine/chemokine concentration control). None of the applied single VOC or VOC mixtures as well as the solvents methanol, methylcyclopentane, and dichloromethane caused cytotoxic effects on A549 cells, although a very broad concentration range covering concentrations between 0.001\u03bcg/m3 and 100g/m3 VOC was tested (data not shown). Neither the single aliphatic compounds n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, methylcyclopentane (Table 1 ) nor the mixture of all these VOC (Fig. 2) showed any effect on the cytokine/chemokine release of TNF-\u03b1 stimulated A549 cells. In addition to the data shown in Table 1 intermediary alkane concentrations were tested which also showed no significant effects (data not shown). As shown in Table 2 , there was also no significant effect of the applied solvents on the cytokine/chemokine production of the A549 cells. Contrary to the aliphatic compounds exposure of A549 cells to the aromatic compounds chlorobenzene, styrene, and m-xylene resulted in different dose-dependent effects on the release of the analysed cytokines/chemokines (Fig. 1 ).

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a specific aliphatic compound tested for its effects on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. The study indicates that decane, along with other aliphatic compounds, did not cause any cytotoxic effects or significant changes in cytokine/chemokine production when compared to control cultures. This suggests that decane does not have a notable biological impact in the tested conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between decane and decane, as they are simply the same compound mentioned in the context without any additional interaction or significance discussed.",
