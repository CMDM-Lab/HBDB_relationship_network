    "context": "However, the assessment of dose\u2013response relationships is restricted in most of the models described. Recently we described a simple experimental model allowing the analysis of inflammatory effects of VOC over a wide concentration range (Wichmann et al., 2005). Primarily developed for the exposure of suspended cells, we have adapted this model for adherent cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially.

        "summary": "In this context, decane and n-dodecane are both mentioned as aliphatic compounds being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are part of a broader analysis of various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but no specific interactions or comparative effects between decane and n-dodecane are detailed. Their inclusion in the same study suggests a shared relevance in the context of VOCs, but their relationship is not explicitly defined.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and n-dodecane are both part of the same study on VOCs, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
