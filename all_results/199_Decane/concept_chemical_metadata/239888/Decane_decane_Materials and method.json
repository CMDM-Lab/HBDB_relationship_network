    "context": "The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially. The mixtures which were tested contained all aromatic compounds (mixture of aromatic compounds), all aliphatic compounds (mixture of aliphatic compounds), or all compounds which were investigated (mixture of all compounds) in a ratio of equal percent by weight.Cellular assays The experiments were performed on the human adherent lung epithelial cell line A549 (lung carcinoma, ATCC No. CCL-185; LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany). A549 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum (both reagents Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Passages 2-20 were used for the VOC exposure experiments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the aliphatic compounds being investigated for its pro-inflammatory potential alongside other similar compounds. The study aims to assess the effects of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including n-decane, on human lung epithelial cells. However, there is no distinct differentiation or specific interaction described between the two mentions of decane, as they refer to the same compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship because 'Decane' and 'decane' are simply two instances of the same term without any additional context or interaction provided. They are mentioned in a list of compounds but do not exhibit any unique relationship.",
