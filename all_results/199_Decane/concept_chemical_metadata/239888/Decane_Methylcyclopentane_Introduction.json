    "context": "However, the assessment of dose\u2013response relationships is restricted in most of the models described. Recently we described a simple experimental model allowing the analysis of inflammatory effects of VOC over a wide concentration range (Wichmann et al., 2005). Primarily developed for the exposure of suspended cells, we have adapted this model for adherent cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially.

        "summary": "In this context, decane and methylcyclopentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study. They are part of a broader analysis of various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but the specific relationship or interaction between decane and methylcyclopentane is not detailed. Their inclusion in the same study suggests they may share similar properties or effects, but no direct connection is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both decane and methylcyclopentane are part of a study on VOCs and their inflammatory effects, but there is no specific discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
        "score": 2
