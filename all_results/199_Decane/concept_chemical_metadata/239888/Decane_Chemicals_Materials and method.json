    "context": "Primarily developed for the exposure of suspended cells, we have adapted this model for adherent cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially. The mixtures which were tested contained all aromatic compounds (mixture of aromatic compounds), all aliphatic compounds (mixture of aliphatic compounds), or all compounds which were investigated (mixture of all compounds) in a ratio of equal percent by weight.Cellular assays The experiments were performed on the human adherent lung epithelial cell line A549 (lung carcinoma, ATCC No. CCL-185; LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany). A549 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum (both reagents Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is one of several aliphatic compounds being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential alongside other chemicals. The study focuses on a range of aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including decane, to assess their effects on human lung epithelial cells. Decane is categorized as a chemical of interest within the broader investigation of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as decane is included in a study examining the effects of various chemicals on cell inflammation. While decane is part of the chemical analysis, the specific interactions or effects of decane alone are not deeply explored.",
        "score": 3
