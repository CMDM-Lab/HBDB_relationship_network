    "context": "However, the assessment of dose\u2013response relationships is restricted in most of the models described. Recently we described a simple experimental model allowing the analysis of inflammatory effects of VOC over a wide concentration range (Wichmann et al., 2005). Primarily developed for the exposure of suspended cells, we have adapted this model for adherent cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially.

        "summary": "In this context, decane and chlorobenzene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study. The research aims to analyze the inflammatory effects of various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, including decane (an aliphatic compound) and chlorobenzene (an aromatic compound), across a wide concentration range. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative effects within the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and chlorobenzene are included in the same study focusing on VOCs and their inflammatory effects, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed beyond their classification as compounds being tested.",
        "score": 2
