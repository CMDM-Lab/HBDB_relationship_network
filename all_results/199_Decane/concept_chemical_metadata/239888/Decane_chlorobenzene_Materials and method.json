    "context": "The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially. The mixtures which were tested contained all aromatic compounds (mixture of aromatic compounds), all aliphatic compounds (mixture of aliphatic compounds), or all compounds which were investigated (mixture of all compounds) in a ratio of equal percent by weight.Cellular assays The experiments were performed on the human adherent lung epithelial cell line A549 (lung carcinoma, ATCC No. CCL-185; LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany). A549 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum (both reagents Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Passages 2-20 were used for the VOC exposure experiments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and chlorobenzene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential. They are part of a broader study examining various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or comparative effects on inflammation. Their relationship is limited to their inclusion in the same experimental framework without detailed analysis of their individual or combined effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and chlorobenzene are categorized together as VOCs in a study on pro-inflammatory potential, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between them.",
        "score": 2
