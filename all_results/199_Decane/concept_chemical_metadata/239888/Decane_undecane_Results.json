    "context": "The lower limit of detection for all cytokines and chemokines was <4pg/ml. Results were expressed as the percentage of cytokine or chemokine release compared to those of control cultures exposed to the solvent without VOC (% cytokine/chemokine release=100%\u00d7mean cytokine/chemokine concentration VOC/mean cytokine/chemokine concentration control). None of the applied single VOC or VOC mixtures as well as the solvents methanol, methylcyclopentane, and dichloromethane caused cytotoxic effects on A549 cells, although a very broad concentration range covering concentrations between 0.001\u03bcg/m3 and 100g/m3 VOC was tested (data not shown). Neither the single aliphatic compounds n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, methylcyclopentane (Table 1 ) nor the mixture of all these VOC (Fig. 2) showed any effect on the cytokine/chemokine release of TNF-\u03b1 stimulated A549 cells. In addition to the data shown in Table 1 intermediary alkane concentrations were tested which also showed no significant effects (data not shown). As shown in Table 2 , there was also no significant effect of the applied solvents on the cytokine/chemokine production of the A549 cells. Contrary to the aliphatic compounds exposure of A549 cells to the aromatic compounds chlorobenzene, styrene, and m-xylene resulted in different dose-dependent effects on the release of the analysed cytokines/chemokines (Fig. 1 ).

        "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are mentioned as part of a study investigating the effects of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. However, neither decane nor undecane, along with other aliphatic compounds, showed any significant effects on cytokine/chemokine production, indicating that their relationship is limited to being part of a broader analysis of VOCs without any specific interaction or impact highlighted between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as decane and undecane are included in the same study regarding VOCs but are not shown to interact or influence each other significantly. Their mention is more about their classification as aliphatic compounds rather than a direct relationship.",
