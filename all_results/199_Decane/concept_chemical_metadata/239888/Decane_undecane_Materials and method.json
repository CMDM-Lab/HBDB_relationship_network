    "context": "The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially. The mixtures which were tested contained all aromatic compounds (mixture of aromatic compounds), all aliphatic compounds (mixture of aliphatic compounds), or all compounds which were investigated (mixture of all compounds) in a ratio of equal percent by weight.Cellular assays The experiments were performed on the human adherent lung epithelial cell line A549 (lung carcinoma, ATCC No. CCL-185; LGC Promochem, Wesel, Germany). A549 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum (both reagents Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Passages 2-20 were used for the VOC exposure experiments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are both aliphatic compounds included in a study investigating the pro-inflammatory potential of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are part of a broader category of n-alkanes being tested for their effects on human lung epithelial cells. However, the specific interactions or comparative effects between decane and undecane are not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and undecane are mentioned together in the context of a study on VOCs, but their specific relationship or interactions are not explored in detail.",
        "score": 2
