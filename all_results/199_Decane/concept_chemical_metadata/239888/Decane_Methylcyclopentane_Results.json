    "context": "The lower limit of detection for all cytokines and chemokines was <4pg/ml. Results were expressed as the percentage of cytokine or chemokine release compared to those of control cultures exposed to the solvent without VOC (% cytokine/chemokine release=100%\u00d7mean cytokine/chemokine concentration VOC/mean cytokine/chemokine concentration control). None of the applied single VOC or VOC mixtures as well as the solvents methanol, methylcyclopentane, and dichloromethane caused cytotoxic effects on A549 cells, although a very broad concentration range covering concentrations between 0.001\u03bcg/m3 and 100g/m3 VOC was tested (data not shown). Neither the single aliphatic compounds n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, methylcyclopentane (Table 1 ) nor the mixture of all these VOC (Fig. 2) showed any effect on the cytokine/chemokine release of TNF-\u03b1 stimulated A549 cells. In addition to the data shown in Table 1 intermediary alkane concentrations were tested which also showed no significant effects (data not shown). As shown in Table 2 , there was also no significant effect of the applied solvents on the cytokine/chemokine production of the A549 cells. Contrary to the aliphatic compounds exposure of A549 cells to the aromatic compounds chlorobenzene, styrene, and m-xylene resulted in different dose-dependent effects on the release of the analysed cytokines/chemokines (Fig. 1 ).

        "summary": "In this context, decane and methylcyclopentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tested for their effects on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. However, neither compound exhibited any cytotoxic effects or significant influence on cytokine/chemokine production when compared to control cultures. Their relationship is limited to their inclusion in the same study without any direct interaction or comparative analysis between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as decane and methylcyclopentane are both part of the same experimental setup but do not interact or influence each other directly. They are categorized together as VOCs tested for similar effects, but no specific relationship is established.",
