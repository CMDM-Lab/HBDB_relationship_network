    "context": "However, the assessment of dose\u2013response relationships is restricted in most of the models described. Recently we described a simple experimental model allowing the analysis of inflammatory effects of VOC over a wide concentration range (Wichmann et al., 2005). Primarily developed for the exposure of suspended cells, we have adapted this model for adherent cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the pro-inflammatory potential of several aliphatic compounds (n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and methylcyclopentane), aromatic compounds (styrene, m-xylene and chlorobenzene), and mixtures of various VOC. A wide concentration range reaching from 0.001\u03bcg/m3 to 100g/m3 was considered. Chemicals Chlorobenzene [CAS 108-90-7], styrene [CAS 100-42-5], m-xylene [CAS 108-38-3], n-nonane [111-84-2], n-decane [124-18-5], n-undecane [1120-21-4], n-dodecane [112-40-3], n-tridecane [629-50-5], and methylcyclopentane [CAS 96-37-7] each in purity \u2a7e99% (GC) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Chlorobenzene, styrene, m-xylene, and the mixture of these aromatic compounds were diluted in methanol (Merck), methylcyclopentane in dichloromethane (Merck), and n-nonane, n-decane, n-undecane, n-dodecane, n-tridecane, and the mixture of the aliphatic compounds in methylcyclopentane (Merck) serially.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the aliphatic compounds being investigated alongside various aromatic compounds, including styrene and m-xylene, for their pro-inflammatory potential. The study aims to analyze the inflammatory effects of both aliphatic and aromatic VOCs over a wide concentration range, indicating a comparative approach to understanding their biological impacts. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between decane and the aromatic compounds beyond their inclusion in the same experimental framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as decane and aromatic compounds are both part of the study on VOCs, but their relationship is not explicitly defined beyond their classification as different types of compounds being tested for similar effects.",
        "score": 2
