    "context": "Clinically, the child in the initial stages was in a crisis situation almost in a daily basis and throughout the 24 days there was a significant improvement of the asthma status control. As verified, the obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the distinction between allergic asthmatic and control children which could be helpful in understanding this pathology through a better insight into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to this condition. Nevertheless, for clinical purposes, and having in mind the future of molecular diagnosis, a smaller set of compounds is necessary to allow a rapid use of exhaled breath for complementary purposes in diagnosis, to follow the disease status and/or the medication effect. For this intent, and taking into consideration the previous assertion that a pattern of alkanes and aldehydes clearly defines both populations under study, just 9 compounds (nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, 3,6-dimethyldecane, dodecane, tetradecane, nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) were selected for a new PLS-DA model. The results are shown in Fig. 7 A and the chosen pattern was able to discriminate both groups showing the exhaled breath testing is a tool that can be used as non-invasive diagnostic method for allergic asthma. To assess both the predictive power and classification model robustness, MCCV was also performed, using similar conditions to the previous test. According to MCCV statistics, the PLS-DA model had a classification rate of 96% and showed 98% sensitivity (\u22452% allergic asthma children being misclassified as controls) and 93% specificity (\u22457% of false positives).

        "summary": "In this context, decane and aldehydes are part of a selected set of compounds used to distinguish between allergic asthmatic children and control subjects through breath analysis. The study highlights that a pattern of alkanes, including decane, and aldehydes, such as nonanal and decanal, can effectively differentiate the two populations, suggesting a potential metabolic pathway association with asthma. However, the specific interactions or roles of decane and aldehydes in this diagnostic process are not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as decane and aldehydes are included in a compound pattern used for distinguishing asthma types, indicating some level of interaction in the context of breath analysis, but lacking detailed discussion on their specific relationship.",
