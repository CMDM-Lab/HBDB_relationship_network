    "context": "The methodology allowed the identification of several hundred compounds pertaining to different chemical families (linear and ramified alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, terpenoids and esters). Multivariate analysis was performed by PLS-DA to a group of selected compounds pertaining to alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones and the GC\u00d7GC\u2013ToFMS showed to be advantageous as distinction between both groups was attained and a high classification rate was achieved. The obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the discrimination between allergic asthmatic and control children, providing insights into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to allergic asthma. In general, a pattern of six compounds pertaining to the alkanes characterized the asthmatic population: 3,6-dimethyldecane, nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, dodecane, and tetradecane. Otherwise, a set of aldehydes (nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) characterizes the control population. Thus, a smaller set of 9 compounds comprising alkanes and aldehydes was chosen to verify the potential clinical usefulness of exhaled breath for allergic asthma evaluation and the obtained results are very satisfactory as, with this set, distinction was obtained. It was also confirmed that it is also possible to follow through the effects of medication. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the specific compounds belonging to the broader category of alkanes. The study highlights the use of various alkanes, including decane, in distinguishing between allergic asthmatic and control populations through breath analysis. This indicates that decane, as an alkane, plays a role in the metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, contributing to the identification of specific breath patterns linked to the condition.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and alkanes, as decane is explicitly mentioned as part of the alkane group used in the study. The context provides evidence of its relevance in distinguishing asthmatic conditions, indicating a clear relationship within the chemical classification and its biological implications.",
