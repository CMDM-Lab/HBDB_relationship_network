    "context": "The methodology allowed the identification of several hundred compounds pertaining to different chemical families (linear and ramified alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, terpenoids and esters). Multivariate analysis was performed by PLS-DA to a group of selected compounds pertaining to alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones and the GC\u00d7GC\u2013ToFMS showed to be advantageous as distinction between both groups was attained and a high classification rate was achieved. The obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the discrimination between allergic asthmatic and control children, providing insights into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to allergic asthma. In general, a pattern of six compounds pertaining to the alkanes characterized the asthmatic population: 3,6-dimethyldecane, nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, dodecane, and tetradecane. Otherwise, a set of aldehydes (nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) characterizes the control population. Thus, a smaller set of 9 compounds comprising alkanes and aldehydes was chosen to verify the potential clinical usefulness of exhaled breath for allergic asthma evaluation and the obtained results are very satisfactory as, with this set, distinction was obtained. It was also confirmed that it is also possible to follow through the effects of medication. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and n-dodecane are identified as part of a group of alkanes that characterize the breath profile of asthmatic children. Both compounds are included in the analysis of breath samples to distinguish between allergic asthmatic and control populations. Their presence in the breath-print suggests a potential link to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, although the specific interactions between decane and n-dodecane are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both decane and n-dodecane are part of the same group of alkanes analyzed in relation to allergic asthma. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not deeply explored, limiting the strength of their connection.",
