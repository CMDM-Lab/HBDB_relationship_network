    "context": "The methodology allowed the identification of several hundred compounds pertaining to different chemical families (linear and ramified alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, terpenoids and esters). Multivariate analysis was performed by PLS-DA to a group of selected compounds pertaining to alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones and the GC\u00d7GC\u2013ToFMS showed to be advantageous as distinction between both groups was attained and a high classification rate was achieved. The obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the discrimination between allergic asthmatic and control children, providing insights into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to allergic asthma. In general, a pattern of six compounds pertaining to the alkanes characterized the asthmatic population: 3,6-dimethyldecane, nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, dodecane, and tetradecane. Otherwise, a set of aldehydes (nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) characterizes the control population. Thus, a smaller set of 9 compounds comprising alkanes and aldehydes was chosen to verify the potential clinical usefulness of exhaled breath for allergic asthma evaluation and the obtained results are very satisfactory as, with this set, distinction was obtained. It was also confirmed that it is also possible to follow through the effects of medication. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane and n-tetradecane are both identified as alkanes that contribute to the 'breath-print' of asthmatic children. They are part of a larger group of compounds analyzed to distinguish between allergic asthmatic and control populations. Their presence in the breath samples suggests a potential link to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, although the specific relationship between decane and n-tetradecane is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both decane and n-tetradecane are mentioned as part of the alkane profile that characterizes asthmatic individuals. However, their specific interaction or comparative significance is not detailed, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
