    "context": "The methodology allowed the identification of several hundred compounds pertaining to different chemical families (linear and ramified alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, terpenoids and esters). Multivariate analysis was performed by PLS-DA to a group of selected compounds pertaining to alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones and the GC\u00d7GC\u2013ToFMS showed to be advantageous as distinction between both groups was attained and a high classification rate was achieved. The obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the discrimination between allergic asthmatic and control children, providing insights into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to allergic asthma. In general, a pattern of six compounds pertaining to the alkanes characterized the asthmatic population: 3,6-dimethyldecane, nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, dodecane, and tetradecane. Otherwise, a set of aldehydes (nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) characterizes the control population. Thus, a smaller set of 9 compounds comprising alkanes and aldehydes was chosen to verify the potential clinical usefulness of exhaled breath for allergic asthma evaluation and the obtained results are very satisfactory as, with this set, distinction was obtained. It was also confirmed that it is also possible to follow through the effects of medication. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the alkanes that characterize the breath profile of asthmatic children. The study highlights the role of decane, along with other compounds, in distinguishing between allergic asthmatic and control populations. This suggests that decane may be relevant in understanding metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, although it is mentioned alongside other compounds without detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as decane is part of a specific breath profile linked to allergic asthma, indicating some significance in the context of metabolic pathways. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its inclusion in a broader analysis.",
