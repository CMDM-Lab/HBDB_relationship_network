    "context": "The methodology allowed the identification of several hundred compounds pertaining to different chemical families (linear and ramified alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds, terpenoids and esters). Multivariate analysis was performed by PLS-DA to a group of selected compounds pertaining to alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and ketones and the GC\u00d7GC\u2013ToFMS showed to be advantageous as distinction between both groups was attained and a high classification rate was achieved. The obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the discrimination between allergic asthmatic and control children, providing insights into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to allergic asthma. In general, a pattern of six compounds pertaining to the alkanes characterized the asthmatic population: 3,6-dimethyldecane, nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, dodecane, and tetradecane. Otherwise, a set of aldehydes (nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) characterizes the control population. Thus, a smaller set of 9 compounds comprising alkanes and aldehydes was chosen to verify the potential clinical usefulness of exhaled breath for allergic asthma evaluation and the obtained results are very satisfactory as, with this set, distinction was obtained. It was also confirmed that it is also possible to follow through the effects of medication. ",

        "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the alkanes that characterize the breath profile of allergic asthmatic children. The study highlights the potential of using breath analysis to distinguish between asthmatic and control populations, suggesting that decane, along with other compounds, may be linked to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma. This indicates a significant relationship between decane and asthma, as it contributes to the identification of asthmatic conditions through breath analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and asthma, as decane is part of a specific breath profile that distinguishes asthmatic children from controls. The study provides evidence supporting this relationship, indicating decane's relevance in the context of allergic asthma evaluation.",
