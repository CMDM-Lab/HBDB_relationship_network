    "context": "The methylated alkanes family have also been previously reported as these may well be important in asthma characterization. These compounds also have an important role in diseases, in which oxidative stress apparently may be involved, but to other extents, and with different consequences than asthma, such as lung and breast cancer, as well as in lung cancer cell lines [65\u201367]. These compounds have been reported in literature in other exhaled breath studies associated to pathological states of the lungs, but as individual markers. For example, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane and decane were identified and compared by Poli et al. in exhaled breath of patients with non-small lung cancer (NSLC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smokers and controls and their concentrations were higher for NSLC, COPD and smokers when compared to controls. Dodecane has been proposed as lung cancer markers. These results evidence that overall, for the allergic asthma group, there is a greater weight of the alkanes confirming the previous study whereas aldehydes have a major importance in the characterization of the control group. Alkanes, in the sequence of oxidation reactions, are end-compounds that have been associated to oxidative stress and inflammation processes and the hypothesis formed is that these compounds indicate that the oxidative state is at a higher extent in asthmatics when compared to controls leading to the obtained differences and consequently the alkanes can be associated to allergic asthma.

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a methylated alkane identified in exhaled breath studies of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study indicates that decane concentrations are higher in COPD patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential role of decane as a biomarker for oxidative stress and inflammation associated with chronic airway diseases. This relationship highlights the significance of alkanes in characterizing lung pathologies, including COPD.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between decane and chronic obstructive airway disease, supported by evidence of higher decane concentrations in COPD patients compared to controls, indicating its potential as a biomarker for the disease.",
