    "context": "Clinically, the child in the initial stages was in a crisis situation almost in a daily basis and throughout the 24 days there was a significant improvement of the asthma status control. As verified, the obtained \u201cbreath-print\u201d allowed the distinction between allergic asthmatic and control children which could be helpful in understanding this pathology through a better insight into the metabolic pathways that may be associated to this condition. Nevertheless, for clinical purposes, and having in mind the future of molecular diagnosis, a smaller set of compounds is necessary to allow a rapid use of exhaled breath for complementary purposes in diagnosis, to follow the disease status and/or the medication effect. For this intent, and taking into consideration the previous assertion that a pattern of alkanes and aldehydes clearly defines both populations under study, just 9 compounds (nonane, 2,2,4,6,6-pentamethylheptane, decane, 3,6-dimethyldecane, dodecane, tetradecane, nonanal, decanal, and dodecanal) were selected for a new PLS-DA model. The results are shown in Fig. 7 A and the chosen pattern was able to discriminate both groups showing the exhaled breath testing is a tool that can be used as non-invasive diagnostic method for allergic asthma. To assess both the predictive power and classification model robustness, MCCV was also performed, using similar conditions to the previous test. According to MCCV statistics, the PLS-DA model had a classification rate of 96% and showed 98% sensitivity (\u22452% allergic asthma children being misclassified as controls) and 93% specificity (\u22457% of false positives).

        "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as part of a set of compounds used to distinguish between allergic asthmatic children and control subjects through breath analysis. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of the HOXA10 gene, which is known to be involved in developmental processes and may have implications in asthma. The relationship between decane and the HOXA10 gene is not established in the provided context, indicating a lack of direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that decane and the HOXA10 gene are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their relationship or relevance to each other. They appear coincidentally without a direct connection.",
