    "context": "For MTBE, Arp and Schmidt (2004) observed an airwater partitioning equilibrium time of less than 15min at 25\u00b0C, but at 4\u00b0C at least 3h equilibration time was required to ensure partitioning equilibrium. Fischer et al. (2004) held their water samples for 90min at 35\u00b0C before sampling the HS for MTBE. Bierwagen and Keller (2001) used an equilibration time of 24h before sampling the HS for MTBE by SPME. In their analysis of ETBE, Arp and Schmidt (2004) used the same equilibration time as for MTBE (15min at 25\u00b0C), on the assumption that ETBE would reach partitioning equilibrium earlier than MTBE. Times required for organic compounds to reach equilibrium between supercooled water and the gas phase above, or between gas and ice phases, have not previously been reported. Therefore, the vial experiments described above were carried out using 4mL amounts of aqueous standard working solutions of BTEX, or MTBE and ETBE, held at a cryostat temperature of 5\u00b0C for 30min, 1day, or 3days prior to HS sampling. Fig. 2 shows the results obtained for benzene, toluene, and MTBE, exemplarily. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to studies on air-water partitioning and equilibration times for various organic compounds, including MTBE and ETBE. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular, indicating that these terms are unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular, as they are mentioned in entirely different contexts without any interaction or significance.",
