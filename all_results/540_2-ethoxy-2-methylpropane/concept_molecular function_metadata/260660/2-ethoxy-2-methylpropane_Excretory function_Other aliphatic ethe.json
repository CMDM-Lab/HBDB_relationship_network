    "context": "The kinetic profile of ETBE in humans could be described by four phases in blood (average half-lives of 2, 18 min, 1.7 and 2.8 h) and two phases in urine (8 min and 8.6 h). Post exposure half-lives of TBA in blood and urine were on average 2 and 8 h, respectively. On an equimolar basis, the 48 h pulmonary excretion of TBA accounted for 1.4\u20133.8% of the absorbed ETBE. Urinary excretion of ETBE and TBA was low, below 1% of ETBE uptake, indicating further metabolism of TBA, or other routes of metabolism and elimination. The kinetics of ETBE and TBA were linear up to 50 ppm, and TBA is a more appropriate biomarker for ETBE than the parent itself. Acetone levels in blood were higher after ETBE than control human volunteers, indicating that acetone is a byproduct of ETBE metabolism (Nihl\u00e9n et al., 1998a). Transient ataxia was observed in male rats following exposure to 5000 ppm of ETBE (Dorman et al., 1997). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is discussed in relation to its metabolic and excretory kinetics in humans. The urinary excretion of ETBE and its metabolite TBA is noted to be low, indicating that the body metabolizes ETBE further before elimination. This suggests a connection between ETBE metabolism and the excretory function, as the body processes and eliminates these compounds through urine, although the specific mechanisms of excretion are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the excretion of ETBE and its metabolite TBA, linking them to the excretory function. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of how excretory function is specifically affected by ETBE metabolism.",
