    "context": "The 500 ppm was considered a NOAEL for inhalation exposure (White et al., 1995b). In a subchronic inhalation exposure study in F-344 rats and CD-1 mice exposed to 500, 1750 and 5000 ppm of ETBE for 6 h/day, 5 days/week over a 13 weeks period, degenerative changes in testicular seminiferous tubules, not seen previously for aliphatic ethers, were observed in male rats, but not mice, exposed to 1750 and 5000 ppm ETBE. Moreover, like MTBE, increases in the labeling index of proximal kidney tubule cells in male rats indicating renal cell proliferation, occurrence of regenerative foci, and accumulation of \u03b12\u03bc-globulin containing protein droplets associated with syndrome of renal nephropathy were seen in the kidneys of all treated rats. As in MTBE and gasoline exposures, increases in the incidence of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy and rates of hepatocyte cell proliferation were also observed in the liver of both male and female mice in the 5000 ppm group, consistent with a mitogenic response to ETBE (Medinsky et al., 1999). Oxidative metabolism of MTBE and ETBE was carried out in rat, monkey and human to evaluate the role of involved P450 isozymes. Purified P450 isoforms, differently treated rat liver microsomes, monkey and human hepatic microsomes, and human recombinant P450s expressed in Escherichia coli were used. Results showed a linear Michaelis and Menten kinetics with all types of microsomes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is associated with hepatocyte hypertrophy observed in mice exposed to high concentrations (5000 ppm). The study indicates that ETBE exposure leads to increased rates of hepatocyte cell proliferation and centrilobular hypertrophy, suggesting a mitogenic response in the liver. This relationship highlights the potential toxicological effects of ETBE on liver tissue, linking it to hypertrophy as a response to chemical exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and hypertrophy, as the study provides evidence of increased hepatocyte hypertrophy and cell proliferation in response to ETBE exposure, indicating a clear toxicological effect.",
        "score": 4
