    "context": "A PBPK model that describes the disposition of TAME and TAA in male F-344 rats has been developed in which the compartments for TAME and TAA were flow limited. The TAME model had six compartments, lung; liver; rapidly perfused tissue; slowly perfused tissue; fat and kidney; whereas the TA model had only three compartments, lung; liver; and total body water. The two models were linked through metabolism of TAME to TAA in the liver (Collins et al., 1999). In the same 4-week rat inhalation study described above for ETBE, TAME resulted in mortality and caused significantly more CNS depression that ETBE, transient changes in either neuromuscular functions or sensory perception, increased relative liver weight without histopathology or functional changes, and a NOAEL of 500 ppm. Moreover, like MTBE and ETBE, inhalation of TAME showed increased relative liver weight in rats exposed to 4000 ppm (White et al., 1995b). On the other hand, subchronic oral studies with TAME (or MTBE) showed no increase in relative liver weight at doses up to 1 g/kg; the reason for this difference is presently not known (White et al., 1995b). A 28-day study in Sprague\u2013Dawley rats dosed orally with TAME in corn oil at concentrations of 0.125, 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg per day for 7 days a week resulted in two compound-related deaths out of ten rats in the high dose group, but no other toxicity signs were reported (Daughtrey and Bird, 1995).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) is discussed in relation to its effects on the central nervous system (CNS), specifically noting that it caused significant CNS depression and transient changes in sensory perception during inhalation studies in rats. However, the term 'Esthesia' is not explicitly defined or elaborated upon in the context, making the relationship between TAME and sensory perception unclear. The mention of sensory perception suggests a potential link, but it lacks detailed exploration.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as TAME is associated with CNS effects that could relate to sensory perception (esthesia), but the context does not provide a direct or detailed connection between the two terms.",
        "score": 3
