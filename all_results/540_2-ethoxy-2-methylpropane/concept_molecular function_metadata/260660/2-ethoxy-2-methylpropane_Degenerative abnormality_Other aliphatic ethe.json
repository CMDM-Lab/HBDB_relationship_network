    "context": "Transient ataxia was observed in male rats following exposure to 5000 ppm of ETBE (Dorman et al., 1997). In a 4 weeks inhalation study in rats exposed to both ETBE and TAME at doses of 500, 2000 or 4000 ppm, 6 h/day, 5 days/week, ETBE animals did not show treatment-related histopathological changes, although significantly increased liver weights were observed in the mid- and high-dose groups. The 500 ppm was considered a NOAEL for inhalation exposure (White et al., 1995b). In a subchronic inhalation exposure study in F-344 rats and CD-1 mice exposed to 500, 1750 and 5000 ppm of ETBE for 6 h/day, 5 days/week over a 13 weeks period, degenerative changes in testicular seminiferous tubules, not seen previously for aliphatic ethers, were observed in male rats, but not mice, exposed to 1750 and 5000 ppm ETBE. Moreover, like MTBE, increases in the labeling index of proximal kidney tubule cells in male rats indicating renal cell proliferation, occurrence of regenerative foci, and accumulation of \u03b12\u03bc-globulin containing protein droplets associated with syndrome of renal nephropathy were seen in the kidneys of all treated rats. As in MTBE and gasoline exposures, increases in the incidence of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy and rates of hepatocyte cell proliferation were also observed in the liver of both male and female mice in the 5000 ppm group, consistent with a mitogenic response to ETBE (Medinsky et al., 1999). Oxidative metabolism of MTBE and ETBE was carried out in rat, monkey and human to evaluate the role of involved P450 isozymes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is associated with degenerative abnormalities observed in male rats following inhalation exposure. Specifically, degenerative changes in testicular seminiferous tubules were noted at higher doses, indicating a potential toxic effect of ETBE. Additionally, other organ-specific changes, such as liver hypertrophy and renal cell proliferation, suggest that ETBE exposure may lead to various degenerative abnormalities in multiple organ systems.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ETBE and degenerative abnormalities, as the study provides evidence of specific histopathological changes in male rats due to exposure, indicating a clear relationship between the chemical and observed biological effects.",
        "score": 4
