    "context": "The principal issue for Congress is whether CAA provisions concerning reformulated gasoline should be modified to allow refiners to discontinue or lessen their use of oxygenates, legislation to permit California refiners to do so has substantial support among the state's congressional delegation. Bills allowing additional flexibility in all states have also been introduced, as have bills that would phase out the use of MTBE (CRS, 2000). The use of MTBE and other ethers as gasoline oxygenates is expected to increase in the coming decades (Costantini, 1993); however, their possible adverse effect on human health remains a public health concern. Two other aliphatic ethers structurally similar to MTBE, such as ETBE and TAME (Fig. 1), have been used in reformulated gasoline because ETBE can be produced from renewable sources, and TAME has lower pressure than MTBE resulting in lower separation emissions. Thus, these two ethers have been proposed as alternate oxygenates for MTBE since the 1980s (HEI, 1996; NRC, 1996). Only few studies have been conducted on these ethers; they are listed below.ETBE Like MTBE, ETBE is metabolized in rat liver microsomes and by rat lung tissue and blood into TBA. Rat P450 2B1 was found to have the highest activity towards ETBE and MTBE in a purified reconstituted system (Turini et al., 1998). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a potential oxygenate for reformulated gasoline, similar to MTBE, ETBE, and TAME. The relationship to pressure as a physical agent is implied through the discussion of TAME having lower pressure than MTBE, which results in lower separation emissions. However, the direct connection between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and pressure is not explicitly detailed, making the relationship somewhat indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the context of gasoline oxygenates and their properties, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship.",
