    "context": "These compounds can readily migrate to air or leach to groundwater. Volatile compounds have caused significant contamination of groundwater in many countries, and much money has been invested in research and remediation systems since the 1970s. Hence, understanding fluid transport through the vadose zone and studying the effects of attenuating contaminants (including volatilization, sorption, dispersion or biodegradation) are essential for predicting the fate of the contaminants and for risk assessment and development of appropriate remediation procedures. Particularly, the interaction between soil and contaminants can greatly affect the mobility of MTBE, ETBE and BTEX. If a significant amount of sorption occurs in the unsaturated zone, contaminants will leach slowly and accumulation of contaminants in the groundwater will be minimized. Sorption is mainly affected by soil components and physical and chemical properties; thus the composition and type of soil in which the fuel leak has occurred and the leachability of volatile fuel contaminants, should therefore, be taken into account for correct management of fuel leaks and for preventing or minimizing groundwater contamination. Leaching tests aim to determine the fraction of contaminants that are loosely bound to soil components and thus mobilized into the water phase. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a volatile compound that can contaminate groundwater, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship to drug interactions. The focus is on the environmental impact of volatile compounds and their behavior in soil and groundwater, rather than any pharmacological interactions or effects related to drug metabolism or efficacy.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relevance between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and drug interactions, as the context primarily discusses environmental contamination without addressing any pharmacological implications or interactions.",
