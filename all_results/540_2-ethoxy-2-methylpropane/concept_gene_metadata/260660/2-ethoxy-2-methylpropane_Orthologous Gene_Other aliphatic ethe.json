    "context": "Results showed a linear Michaelis and Menten kinetics with all types of microsomes. Microsomes from phenobarbital and pyrazole treated rats, compared with control microsomes, showed a V max increase of four and two times, respectively, both in MTBE and ETBE dealkylation, suggesting a catalytic role for 2B1 and 2E1. Inhibition experiments with 4-methylpyrazole, metyrapone, anti 2B1 and anti 2E1, and catalytic experiments with purified rat P450 (1A1, 2B1, 2C11, 2E1) confirmed a primary role of 2B1 and a secondary one of 2E1 in the two ether dealkylations. With monkey microsomes, in which the orthologous 2B is absent, it was shown that MTBE and ETBE metabolism depends at least partially on 2E1. Finally, with human microsomes, MTBE and ETBE dealkylations were inhibited by methoxypsoralen and correlated with coumarin hydroxylation, but not with enzymatic rates of 2E1 substrates, suggesting a key role of 2A6. Using human recombinant P450s (1A2, 2C10, 2E1, 3A4), the secondary role of 2E1 in humans was confirmed (Amato et al., 1999). In a computer-automated structure evaluation (CASE) study, where ETBE structure was compared with the structure of known determinants of carcinogenicity in rodents, ETBE was predicted to be neither a genotoxicant nor a carcinogen (Rosenkranz and Klopman, 1991).TAME TAME received serious consideration as an oxygenate in the early 1990s, in spite of its slightly lower octane content than other ethers, as it compares favorably for vapor pressure, boiling point, energy density and water mixability (Caprino and Tonga, 1998; WHO, 1998).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is discussed in relation to its metabolic pathways involving cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly 2B1 and 2E1. The mention of 'orthologous gene' refers to the absence of the 2B enzyme in monkey microsomes, indicating a comparative analysis of metabolic functions across species. However, the relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and orthologous genes is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on enzyme activity rather than a direct connection to gene orthology.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to metabolic processes but lack a detailed discussion of their relationship. The context primarily emphasizes enzyme activity rather than a direct link to orthologous genes.",
