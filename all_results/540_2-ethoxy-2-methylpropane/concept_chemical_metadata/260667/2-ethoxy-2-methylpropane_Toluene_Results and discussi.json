    "context": "Rate constants k (Table 2) were proportional to the leaching rate of the contaminants in the samples used (Eq. (1)). In A Camb, k can be ordered as follows: MTBE>ETBE>benzene> m/p-xylene>ethylbenzene> o-xylene>toluene. In B Camb, the rate constants of the contaminants were not so different and the order was almost the opposite of that obtained for A Camb: toluene>ethylbenzene> o-xylene> m/p-xylene=benzene>MTBE>ETBE. As observed for the leachability, the leaching rate was also influenced by sorption interactions between soil and contaminants, in which the sorption strength was inversely related to the leaching rate. The leaching kinetics had a first stage with a very fast leaching rate (Fig. 2), probably corresponding to the fraction of contaminant that was more weakly retained, and a slower second stage, until reaching equilibrium, probably corresponding to the tightly bound faction. In B Camb (Fig. 2b) the pore volume at which this change of stage occurred was very similar for all the contaminants (4th pore volume), reflecting very similar leaching kinetics for all contaminants (also shown by similar k rates in Table 2).

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as contaminants whose leaching rates were analyzed in soil samples. The study compares the leaching kinetics of various contaminants, including toluene, but does not provide specific interactions or relationships between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same analysis of leaching behavior. Their relationship is primarily based on their presence in the same experimental context rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of a study on leaching rates in soil, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relevance to each other.",
