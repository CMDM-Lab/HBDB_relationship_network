    "context": "observed that sodium citrate and oxalate, at levels usually exuded by plant roots, effectively enhanced the desorption of p,p\u2032-DDT, p,p\u2032-DDE and \u03b1-cypermethrin. investigated the effect of short-chain organic acids on the mobilization of phenanthrene in a soil-water system in the presence of biosurfactants, and observed an increase in contaminant desorption. On the other hand, in the presence of organic matter, as in A Camb, these root exudate-contaminant complexes may enhance the affinity of the contaminants for organic matter, causing a decrease in the leachability, especially of the most hydrophobic contaminants (highest K oc values) (Table 1): ethylbenzene and xylene. We also observed this in a previous study, in which the same plant exudate solution favoured the retention of MTBE, ETBE and BTEX in A Camb. In B Camb, as occurred in A Camb, the effect on the contaminant (except for toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers) was very similar in column and batch experiments. In general, in the column system with B Camb, the exudates had less effect (the ratio varied from 1.6 to 1.8; Fig. 3) on the least mobile compounds (least soluble and volatile), indicating that the interaction contaminant-exudate was hindered and the mobility was principally governed by the physical properties of the contaminants. However, in the batch system, the exudates had a significantly greater effect on the highest molecular weight BTEX (the ratio varied from 2.1 to 2.3; Fig. 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether are both mentioned as organic compounds, but their specific relationship is not discussed. The context focuses on the effects of various organic compounds on contaminant desorption and retention in soil systems, without detailing any direct interaction or comparison between these two compounds. They are part of a broader discussion on the behavior of organic contaminants in environmental systems, but no significant connection is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the discussion on organic contaminants, but there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions within the context provided.",
