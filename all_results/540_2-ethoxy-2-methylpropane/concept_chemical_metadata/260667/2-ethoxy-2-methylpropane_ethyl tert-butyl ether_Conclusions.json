    "context": "On the other hand, in the absence of organic matter (B Camb), sorption took place on inorganic soil components, and the most polar components were those with the lowest leachability. In general, the leaching rate was higher when the interaction between contaminant and sample was weaker (e.g. MTBE in A Camb) and it was lower when the interaction was stronger (e.g. ETBE in B Camb). Considering this, groundwater from sites with markedly different soil horizons would be expected to be better protected from contamination than areas with homogeneous soil profiles, as the previously mentioned selective retention would be favoured in the dissimilar horizons of the soil profile. The shaking step of batch experiments favoured FO and BTEX desorption, particularly in B Camb. Thus, packed-columns provided more realistic conditions for predicting the leachability of volatile organics in soils with different characteristics, and they are therefore more appropriate for use in leaching forecast for risk assessment.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to soil contamination and leachability studies. However, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between these two compounds. Instead, it discusses their behavior in the context of soil profiles and leaching rates, indicating that both are part of a broader discussion on VOCs without specific connections to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to soil contamination, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships in the context provided.",
