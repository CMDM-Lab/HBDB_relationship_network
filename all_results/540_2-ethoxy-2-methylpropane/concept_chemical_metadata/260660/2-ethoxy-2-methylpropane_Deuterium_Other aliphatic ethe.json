    "context": "Only few studies have been conducted on these ethers; they are listed below.ETBE Like MTBE, ETBE is metabolized in rat liver microsomes and by rat lung tissue and blood into TBA. Rat P450 2B1 was found to have the highest activity towards ETBE and MTBE in a purified reconstituted system (Turini et al., 1998). TBA is further metabolized into 2-methyl-1,2-propanediol and \u03b1-hydroxyisobuteric acid, both of which are subsequently excreted in urine (Johanson et al., 1995). The kinetic profile of ETBE in humans could be described by four phases in blood (average half-lives of 2, 18 min, 1.7 and 2.8 h) and two phases in urine (8 min and 8.6 h). Post exposure half-lives of TBA in blood and urine were on average 2 and 8 h, respectively. On an equimolar basis, the 48 h pulmonary excretion of TBA accounted for 1.4\u20133.8% of the absorbed ETBE. Urinary excretion of ETBE and TBA was low, below 1% of ETBE uptake, indicating further metabolism of TBA, or other routes of metabolism and elimination. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is discussed in relation to its metabolism in rat liver microsomes and other tissues, but there is no mention of deuterium or its relevance to the metabolism of this ether. Deuterium, a stable isotope of hydrogen, is not directly connected to the metabolic pathways or kinetics of 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane as described in the provided studies. Therefore, their relationship appears coincidental without any specific interaction or relevance highlighted in the context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and deuterium, as deuterium is not mentioned in the context of the ether's metabolism or effects.",
