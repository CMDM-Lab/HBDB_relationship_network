    "context": "The TAME model had six compartments, lung; liver; rapidly perfused tissue; slowly perfused tissue; fat and kidney; whereas the TA model had only three compartments, lung; liver; and total body water. The two models were linked through metabolism of TAME to TAA in the liver (Collins et al., 1999). In the same 4-week rat inhalation study described above for ETBE, TAME resulted in mortality and caused significantly more CNS depression that ETBE, transient changes in either neuromuscular functions or sensory perception, increased relative liver weight without histopathology or functional changes, and a NOAEL of 500 ppm. Moreover, like MTBE and ETBE, inhalation of TAME showed increased relative liver weight in rats exposed to 4000 ppm (White et al., 1995b). On the other hand, subchronic oral studies with TAME (or MTBE) showed no increase in relative liver weight at doses up to 1 g/kg; the reason for this difference is presently not known (White et al., 1995b). A 28-day study in Sprague\u2013Dawley rats dosed orally with TAME in corn oil at concentrations of 0.125, 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg per day for 7 days a week resulted in two compound-related deaths out of ten rats in the high dose group, but no other toxicity signs were reported (Daughtrey and Bird, 1995). A 90-day inhalation study with TAA in CD-1 mice and F-344 rats and beagle dogs was carried out in the 1980s to investigate its toxicity (Dow Chemical USA, 1981). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both discussed in relation to their toxicological effects in rat inhalation studies. While TAME is noted for causing CNS depression and increased liver weight, ETBE is mentioned as a comparative substance. However, the specific interactions or metabolic pathways between TAME and ETBE are not detailed, indicating a general connection through their classification as ethers and their studied effects on liver weight and CNS function.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are compared in terms of their toxicological effects in similar studies, but there is no direct interaction or metabolic relationship explicitly described between them.",
        "score": 3
