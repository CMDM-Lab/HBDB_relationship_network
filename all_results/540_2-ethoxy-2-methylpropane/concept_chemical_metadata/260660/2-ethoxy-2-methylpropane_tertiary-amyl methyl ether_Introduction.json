    "context": "Currently, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in concentrations up to 15% by volume (\u223c2.7% oxygen by weight) is the predominant chemical oxygenate because of favorable qualities such as its manufacturing and distribution capabilities, performance qualities (high octane number, low sulfur content, blending vapor pressure and boiling point) and its low cost compared with other high-octane components. Ethanol is also used as a fuel oxygenate, but to a lesser extent than methanol, because of its high cost. Toxicities of ethanol and methanol have been detailed elsewhere (ATSDR, 1993; Ahmed, 1995). Other oxygenates such as ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), tertiary-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) are also used. The odor threshold for ether\u2013gasoline blends is 15\u201380% lower than gasoline alone (White et al., 1995a). Fig. 1 shows the structure and metabolism of the most commonly used aliphatic ethers, the subject of this review. Environmental exposure, compound fate and health risks MTBE is a volatile ether that is derived from the catalytic reaction of methanol and isobutylene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and tertiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME) are both mentioned as types of ether compounds used as fuel oxygenates. However, the context primarily focuses on methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and its properties, with only a brief mention of TAME among other ethers. There is no detailed discussion of the specific relationship or comparison between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and TAME, indicating a general category connection rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and TAME, as both are classified as ether compounds used in fuel applications. However, the lack of specific interaction or detailed relationship in the context limits their relevance.",
        "score": 2
