    "context": "At a minimum, testing for non-oxygenated fuel alternatives should include sufficient data to develop an adequate risk assessment. These tests should include inhalation and ingestion data through animal toxicity and human microenvironmental exposure studies using both the additives themselves and the gasoline mixtures of which they are a part. Refiners in California have produced non-oxygenated fuels using low sulfur alkylates and aromatics that met or exceeded all California RFG air quality requirements (EPA, 1999). Compared with MTBE, ETBE is less economical to produce, and TAME is more toxic. Methanol is more economical to manufacture than ethanol, but more studies on the relationship between chronic low level exposure and subtle changes in CNS function need to be carried out (Caprino and Tonga, 1998), and no studies were performed on the magnitude of methanol to reduce CO, O3 and VOCs in non-attainment areas. Ethanol poses challenges to the gasoline distribution system, and in the short-term are unlikely to be available in sufficient quantities to replace MTBE nationwide. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which aliphatic ethers induce their toxic effect, and their groundwater characteristics ought to be further explored before they are allowed to be placed in widespread use.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as non-oxygenated fuel alternatives. However, the discussion primarily focuses on the economic and toxicological comparisons of various fuel additives, including ETBE and MTBE, without a direct examination of the relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ETBE. Their mention suggests they belong to the same category of fuel additives, but no specific interactions or comparative analysis is provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are discussed in the context of fuel alternatives, but there is no detailed exploration of their relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
