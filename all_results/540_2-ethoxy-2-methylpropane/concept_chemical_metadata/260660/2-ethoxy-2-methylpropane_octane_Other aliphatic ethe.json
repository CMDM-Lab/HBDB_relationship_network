    "context": "With monkey microsomes, in which the orthologous 2B is absent, it was shown that MTBE and ETBE metabolism depends at least partially on 2E1. Finally, with human microsomes, MTBE and ETBE dealkylations were inhibited by methoxypsoralen and correlated with coumarin hydroxylation, but not with enzymatic rates of 2E1 substrates, suggesting a key role of 2A6. Using human recombinant P450s (1A2, 2C10, 2E1, 3A4), the secondary role of 2E1 in humans was confirmed (Amato et al., 1999). In a computer-automated structure evaluation (CASE) study, where ETBE structure was compared with the structure of known determinants of carcinogenicity in rodents, ETBE was predicted to be neither a genotoxicant nor a carcinogen (Rosenkranz and Klopman, 1991).TAME TAME received serious consideration as an oxygenate in the early 1990s, in spite of its slightly lower octane content than other ethers, as it compares favorably for vapor pressure, boiling point, energy density and water mixability (Caprino and Tonga, 1998; WHO, 1998). In rats, TAME is oxidized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and 2B1 into formaldehyde and TAA. TAA is further metabolized by two different mechanisms P450 oxidation leading to 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methyl-butane, and glucuronide conjugation leading to TAA glucuronide (Fig. 1). A PBPK model that describes the disposition of TAME and TAA in male F-344 rats has been developed in which the compartments for TAME and TAA were flow limited. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) and octane are both discussed in relation to their properties as fuel components and their metabolic pathways. TAME is noted for its slightly lower octane content compared to other ethers, which affects its performance as an oxygenate in fuels. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or significant relationship between TAME and octane beyond their roles in fuel chemistry.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are mentioned in the context of fuel properties, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or functional relationship.",
