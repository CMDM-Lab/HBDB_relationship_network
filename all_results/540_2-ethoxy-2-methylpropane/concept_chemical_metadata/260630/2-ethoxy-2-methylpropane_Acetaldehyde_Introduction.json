    "context": " [8] The aim of the present work was to test for the existence of cancer-derived VOCs through the analysis of established cell lines (-).  [9] In previous experiments, we investigated three lung cancer cell lines, NCI-H2087 , CALU-1 , and NCI-H1666.5 [10] In NCI-H2087 cells, the release of the alcohol 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and the branched alkane 2-methylpentane was observed as well as a decline of acetaldehyde, 2-methylpropanal, 3-methylbutanal, 2-methylbutanal, and n-butyl acetate . [11] The cell line CALU-1 showed a significant release of branched hydrocarbons such as 2,3,3-trimethylpentane, 2,3,5-trimethylhexane, and 2,4-dimethylheptane and 4-methyloctane, whereas decreased concentrations were found for acetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, n-butyl acetate, acetonitrile, acrolein, methacrolein, 2-methylpropanal, 2-butanone, methyl tert-butyl ether, ethyl tert-butyl ether, and hexanal . [12] However, no significantly increased release of VOCs could be shown for NCI-H1666 cells,5 whereas a decrease in methacrolein, 3-methylbutanal, hexanal, and n-butyl acetate was observed. [13] Thus, in our studies, compounds especially belonging to the class of branched hydrocarbons were released from lung cancer cells in vitro, whereas, in particular, aldehydes and n-butyl acetate decreased in concentration. [1] A549 cells, which carry a mutated K-Ras but a wild-type B-Raf gene, have been obtained from American Type Culture Collection. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in the study of lung cancer cell lines. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed. Acetaldehyde concentrations were noted to decline in certain cell lines, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship established between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and acetaldehyde in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the VOC analysis in lung cancer studies, but their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed.",
