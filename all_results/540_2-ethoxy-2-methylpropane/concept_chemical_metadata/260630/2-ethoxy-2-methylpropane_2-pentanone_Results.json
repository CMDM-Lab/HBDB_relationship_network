    "context": "[7] More detailed information can be found in Table 1. [1] In the case of the HBEpC, four independent measurements were done for medium controls (n = 4) and three for 50 million HBEpC cells (n = 3). [2] The concentrations of 10 compounds were increased and of 8 compounds decreased in the headspace of HBEpC cells compared with medium control (Table 2). [3] As already observed in A549 cells, acetone, ethyl tert-butyl ether, 2-pentanone, and 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptene were released by HBEpC cells in significant amounts (Fig. 2). [4] The remaining six VOCs with increased concentrations in the headspace of HBEpC included the three branched hydrocarbons 2,3,3-trimethylpentane, 4-methylheptane, and 3-methylheptane. [5] The concentration of 2,3,3-trimethylpentane was below the LOD in the headspace of medium controls and the other two were not detected in the controls at all. [6] In addition, the alcohol 2-methyl-2-propanol and the esters methyl acetate and n-propyl acetate (not detected in the medium control headspace) had increased concentrations in HFB cells. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and 2-pentanone are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by HBEpC cells. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are simply listed among other compounds analyzed in the headspace of the cells. There is no indication of interaction or comparative significance between the two compounds in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the same analysis of VOCs released by HBEpC cells, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
