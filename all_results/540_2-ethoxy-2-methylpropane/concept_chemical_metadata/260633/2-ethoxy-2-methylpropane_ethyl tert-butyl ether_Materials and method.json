    "context": "But, Henry\u2019s law coefficients are not appropriate to characterize the partitioning of VOC between a gas phase and a solid phase, which is the case when the supercooled water is frozen to ice at \u221225\u00b0C. However, all partitioning coefficients determined for the whole temperature range down to \u221225\u00b0C are termed Henry\u2019s law coefficients to ease the reading of the present manuscript. At temperatures above 0\u00b0C K AW coefficients of analytes can be calculated after equilibration according to Henry\u2019s law (Bierwagen and Keller, 2001; Arp and Schmidt, 2004; Goss, 2006). For BTEX, MTBE and ETBE, K AW values at 5\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C were derived from previous reports (Staudinger and Roberts, 2001; Arp and Schmidt, 2004), which also provided data necessary for any adjustment of K AW values with experimental temperatures. Based on the K AW values, the absolute amounts of analytes in the gas phase (n air, nmol) were calculated for 5\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C according to Eq. (2), and correlated with the measured GC responses at the particular temperature. (2) n air = V air \u00b7 K AW \u00b7 n 0 V air \u00b7 K AW + V liquid where n 0 is the amount (nmol) of analyte in the initial standard solution, V liquid is the volume of the liquid phase (mL), and V air is the volume of the gas phase (mL). With the correlation parameters (from correlation of the measured GC responses and calculated n air values above 0\u00b0C) GC responses measured at \u22125\u00b0C, \u221215\u00b0C, and \u221225\u00b0C were transformed to n air values.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether are both mentioned in relation to partitioning coefficients and their behavior as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under varying temperature conditions. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance, as the focus is primarily on the methodology for calculating partitioning coefficients rather than on the compounds themselves.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether, as they are both categorized as VOCs discussed in the context of partitioning coefficients. However, their relationship lacks detailed exploration or specific interactions.",
