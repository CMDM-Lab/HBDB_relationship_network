    "context": "Results have shown that during the transformation of supercooled water to ice BTEX moves more rapidly into the gas phase than MTBE and ETBE. These results can be explained by the existence of a QLL covering the ice surface at \u221225\u00b0C. In previous studies, the QQL has been observed on ice surfaces at temperatures down to \u221235\u00b0C (D\u00f6ppenschmidt and Butt, 2000; Rosenberg, 2005). Considering the higher Henry\u2019s law coefficients and the lower water solubilities of BTEX in comparison to the oxygenates MTBE and ETBE (see Table 1), MTBE and ETBE might preferentially remain in the QLL whereas BTEX is removed from the ice and the QLL into the gas phase. This leads to the observed nonlinear variation of Henry coefficients for benzene and toluene at temperatures below 0\u00b0C (Fig. 3a and b). Sorption coefficients presented by Hoff et al. (1995) are measured in a temperature range of 0\u00b0C to \u221210\u00b0C and show an increasing sorption of organic vapors on the ice surface with decreasing temperatures supposable with a concomitant decrease of the thickness of the QLL (Conklin and Bales, 1993). A possible impact of the QLL on the temperature dependence of the partitioning of the analytes between ice and the gas phase presented in this study could not be derived from our experiments, because only at one data point (\u221225\u00b0C) a QLL is expected in the vials.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned in relation to their behavior in the gas phase and their solubility characteristics compared to BTEX compounds. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships. The focus is primarily on the comparative solubility and phase behavior of these compounds rather than a detailed connection between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are discussed in the context of their solubility and phase behavior, but there is no detailed interaction or significant relationship established between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether.",
        "score": 2
