    "context": "Based on this correlation, Henry\u2019s law coefficients between supercooled water/ice and the gas phase were calculated for BTEX, and MTBE and ETBE, from the GC responses measured at temperatures below 0\u00b0C. The amounts of organic compounds in the HS (n air, nmol), the measured GC responses (for all temperature increments), and the correlation parameters, are presented in Table 2 . In accordance with Henry\u2019s law, Table 2 shows an increase in GC response for all compounds with increasing temperature from 5\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. A strong correlation was observed between GC responses and n air values at temperatures above 0\u00b0C for all compounds (R 2 >0.96 for toluene till R 2 >0.99 for o-xylene, MTBE, and ETBE; Table 2). For temperatures below 0\u00b0C an increase in GC response with decreasing temperature was observed for all target compounds. Using Eq. (3), n air values are converted into dimensionless Henry\u2019s law coefficients for GC responses at temperatures below 0\u00b0C. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between ln K AW and T \u22121 exemplarily for benzene, toluene, and MTBE. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as organic compounds analyzed under the framework of Henry's law, which relates the solubility of gases in liquids to their partial pressures. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparisons between the two compounds, focusing instead on their individual gas chromatography (GC) responses and correlations with temperature changes. Thus, while they are part of the same study, their relationship is not explicitly defined.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are included in the same analysis related to Henry's law but lack a direct interaction or significant relationship discussed in the context.",
        "score": 2
