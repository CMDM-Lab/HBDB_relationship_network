    "context": "Due to the sensitivity of the instrument, the levels measured within the facility might not differ from the background level of \u223c1.4 ppm. This finding indicated that the emission of organics were not significant, even though there were some subjective complaints from workers about the rubber odor. Chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds using multi-bed sorbent and GC/MS reveals the presence of various categories of air contaminants (Table 1 ). These contaminants include aliphatics (for example octane, decane and undecane), aromatics (for example benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, ethyl-methylbenzenes, propylbenzene and tri-methylbenzenes), methyl isobutyl ketone, styrene, benzothiazole and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (for example naphthalene and methylated-naphthalenes). Importantly, the above list may not be exhaustive due to the methodological limitation. Among the chemicals found in the plants, ketone, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, (particularly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), are all widely used industrial solvents or common environmental pollutants. Benzothiazole, which is the basic moiety of most common organic sulfur donor accelerators/accelerants (mainly 2-mercapto-benzothiazole or MBT), was found in all air samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole and decane are both mentioned as components of air contaminants analyzed in a facility. They belong to different categories of volatile organic compounds, with benzothiazole being an aromatic compound and decane being an aliphatic hydrocarbon. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between them beyond their classification as contaminants in the air samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-Benzothiazole and decane are both listed among various air contaminants but lack a detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction within the context.",
