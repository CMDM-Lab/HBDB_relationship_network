    "context": "Due to the sensitivity of the instrument, the levels measured within the facility might not differ from the background level of \u223c1.4 ppm. This finding indicated that the emission of organics were not significant, even though there were some subjective complaints from workers about the rubber odor. Chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds using multi-bed sorbent and GC/MS reveals the presence of various categories of air contaminants (Table 1 ). These contaminants include aliphatics (for example octane, decane and undecane), aromatics (for example benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, ethyl-methylbenzenes, propylbenzene and tri-methylbenzenes), methyl isobutyl ketone, styrene, benzothiazole and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (for example naphthalene and methylated-naphthalenes). Importantly, the above list may not be exhaustive due to the methodological limitation. Among the chemicals found in the plants, ketone, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, (particularly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes), are all widely used industrial solvents or common environmental pollutants. Benzothiazole, which is the basic moiety of most common organic sulfur donor accelerators/accelerants (mainly 2-mercapto-benzothiazole or MBT), was found in all air samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are both identified as categories of air contaminants found in the chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds. While they are mentioned together as part of a broader list of organic pollutants, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between them beyond their classification as contaminants in the environment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-Benzothiazole and PAHs are both listed as air contaminants but lack a detailed discussion of their interaction or significance in the context provided. Their relationship is more about their co-occurrence in environmental samples rather than a direct chemical or functional link.",
