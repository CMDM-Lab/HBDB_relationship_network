    "context": "BT was in a range of 0.03\u20130.27\u03bcgL\u22121 in all CRM samples (Table 4). During the natural weathering experiment leachable BT reduced from 0.18 to 0.02\u03bcgL\u22121 after 70d (Supplementary content, Appendix C) which may be due to loss through evaporation (described in next section). ABT, MBT and MTBT were not detected in any extractions which agree with a previous report showing that MBT and MTBT were negligible for the total contribution of benzothiazoles in street run-off (Kloepfer et al., 2005). More work needs to be done for the other major leachable benzothiazole derivatives (e.g., benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid BTSA, 2-mercapto benzothiazole MCBT and 2-hydroxybenzothiazole OHBT) detected with higher or similar level as BT in the CRM leachate and wastewater samples as reported previously (Reddy and Quinn, 1997; Kloepfer et al., 2004, 2005). Zinc was the highest leachable metal (0.7\u20133.6\u03bcgL\u22121) in the extraction fluid of all CRM samples (Table 4) due to the use of zinc oxide in tire rubber manufacture as a vulcanization activator (1.2%) (Wik and Dave, 2009). Surprisingly, Zn in the leachates for two field-aged CRM samples was 4\u20135 times higher than the virgin CRM samples and relatively higher levels of Ni and Pb were also found in the leachate of field-aged samples. Both field samples were collected right after large rain events. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole (BT) and benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid (BTSA) are mentioned as part of a discussion on leachable benzothiazole derivatives in environmental samples. While BT levels were quantified, BTSA is noted as a major derivative detected at similar or higher levels. This suggests a potential relationship in terms of environmental impact and chemical behavior, but no direct interaction or transformation between the two compounds is explicitly described.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both compounds are discussed in the context of environmental leachates, indicating they are part of the same chemical family and relevant to the study, but without detailed interaction or functional relationship provided.",
        "score": 3
