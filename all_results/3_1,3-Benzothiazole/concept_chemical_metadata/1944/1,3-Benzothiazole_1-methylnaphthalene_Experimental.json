    "context": "Analysis of the vapor phase above the CRM samples via direct gas phase injection was used to quantify the volatilized compounds from CRM samples. The alteration of the pattern of volatile compounds with time after installation was assessed for both laboratory and field-aged samples under natural weathering conditions. And finally, the accessibility of substances in the CRM to leaching by aqueous solutions was also examined. Standards Individual standards of benzothiazole (BT), 2-methylbenzothiazole (MBT), 1-methylnaphthalene (1-MeNA), 2-methylnaphthalene (2-MeNA), fluoranthene (Flu), naphthalene (NA), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP), were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Phenanthrene (Phe) and pyrene (Pyr) were purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). Deuterated NA and Pyr were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA).Samples All samples were received in pre-cleaned Qorpak\u00ae jars as finely ground particles (0.84\u20132.0mm diameter) made from either recycled tire rubber (T) or other alternative rubber materials (A). A total of 15 commercial CRM samples, that were ready to be used as infill material on artificial turf fields, were supplied to the laboratory at The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP); one was purchased by Environment and Human Health Inc. (EHHI). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole and 1-methylnaphthalene are both mentioned as individual standards purchased for analysis in a study examining volatile compounds from CRM samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interaction, or significance in the context of the study. They are simply listed among other compounds without any specific connection or comparative analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,3-Benzothiazole and 1-methylnaphthalene are merely listed as standards used in the analysis without any further discussion of their interactions or relevance to each other.",
