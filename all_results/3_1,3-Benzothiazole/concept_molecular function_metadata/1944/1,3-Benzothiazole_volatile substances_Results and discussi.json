    "context": "Similar levels of 4-t-OP were also detected in the Te tire CRM (48\u03bcgg\u22121) and A1 alternative CRM (5.4\u03bcgg\u22121). Generally, the volatilized compounds found in the vapor phase (Table 2) were three to four orders lower than the total amounts in the CRMs.Leachable chemicals from CRM All commercial CRM samples were extracted by the modified standard method (EPA 1312, 1994) as a surrogate for rigorous conditions in natural storm events. Distilled water (fluid 1) and acidified water (fluid 2) were employed to show the effect of normal and acid rain water for leaching of organics and metals off CRM in the field. The SPE method was applied to concentrate the most abundant volatile compound, benzothiazole and its derivatives including ABT, MBT, and MTBT (Kloepfer et al., 2004). Excellent recoveries were achieved for both fortified blank (85\u00b16% BT, 87\u00b110% ABT, 96\u00b13% MBT; 94\u00b15% MTBT; n =4) and sample extractions spiked with MBT (92\u00b16%; n =25). There was no significant difference between two extraction fluids for the organic chemicals (Table 4 ). BT was in a range of 0.03\u20130.27\u03bcgL\u22121 in all CRM samples (Table 4). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole is identified as a volatile compound that was concentrated and analyzed among other leachable chemicals from commercial CRM samples. The study highlights the presence of 1,3-Benzothiazole and its derivatives in the vapor phase, indicating its classification as a volatile substance. However, the relationship is primarily descriptive, focusing on detection rather than functional interactions or implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,3-Benzothiazole is categorized as a volatile substance within the study. While it is mentioned in the context of volatilized compounds, there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance beyond its identification as a volatile compound.",
