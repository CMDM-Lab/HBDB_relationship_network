    "context": "Skin irritation following exposure to chemicals or UV light appears to be modulated in part by oxidative stress (Yasui and Sakurai, 2000; Willis et al., 2001). Antioxidants applied to the skin can inhibit or reduce the degree of dermal irritation caused by chemical or UV light exposure (Senaldi et al., 1994; Bangha et al., 1996; Fuchs and Kern, 1998; Lange et al., 1998; Katiyar et al., 1999; Dreher and Maibach, 2001). The VOC m-xylene is considered an irritant and exposure to m-xylene can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, as well as the formation of oxidative species and DNA damage (Steele and Wilhelm, 1966, 1970; Rogers et al., 2001). The results of the present study show that m-xylene induces cytotoxicity and promotes decreases in cellular antioxidants (thiols and catalase) in fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity observed at high chemical concentrations in which there was an observed marginal decrease (\u224810\u201320%) in endogenous levels of thiols and catalase may result from cellular damage other than oxidative stress. However, the observed significant decrease in cellular thiols and catalase from 1 to 4 h suggests that free radicals may be formed with increasing chemical concentration and exposure time, leading to depletion of thiols and catalase. Moreover, supplementation of the dermal equivalents with catalase or NAC appears to partially inhibit m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting oxidative stress may play a role in the cytotoxic effect of m-xylene in rat dermal fibroblasts.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is implicated in inducing cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in fibroblasts, leading to a decrease in cellular antioxidants, specifically sulfhydryl compounds (thiols). The study indicates that exposure to 1,3-xylene results in a significant reduction of these antioxidants, suggesting a direct relationship where the presence of 1,3-xylene contributes to the depletion of sulfhydryl compounds due to oxidative damage.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,3-xylene and sulfhydryl compounds, as the context discusses how exposure to 1,3-xylene leads to a measurable decrease in thiols, indicating a clear relationship supported by experimental evidence.",
        "score": 4
