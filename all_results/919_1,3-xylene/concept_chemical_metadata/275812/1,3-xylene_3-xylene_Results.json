    "context": "The viability of cells exposed to 1000 U/ml catalase was 98.3\u00b12.1% of sham-exposed controls. When compared to m-xylene exposures, pretreatment with either 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC led to significant increases (P<0.05) in the EC50 values at 1 and 4 h (Table 1). Increases in these EC50 values ranged from 1.22- to 1.32-fold at 1 h and 1.27- to 1.54-fold at 4 h. Although pre-treatment with catalase led to a 1.35-fold increase in cell viability at 1 h, no significant differences were observed at either 1 or 4 h when compared to dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene alone. Exposure methods have been developed for in vitro assessment of volatile chemical-induced cytotoxicity (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). The headspace and culture medium volume, chemical solubility and chemical partitioning affect VOC dosimetry. A problem with conducting in vitro exposures using VOCs is maintaining these chemicals in solution to achieve a uniform exposure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned in relation to their effects on cell viability during exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the specific relationship between these two is not detailed, as the focus is primarily on m-xylene and the effects of pretreatment with catalase and NAC on cell viability. The mention of 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene does not indicate a direct interaction or comparison between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are mentioned in the context of VOC exposure, but their relationship is not explored in detail. They share a general category as xylene isomers but lack a specific connection in the study.",
