    "context": "Each sample was sonicated for 5\u201310 s and then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000\u00d7g. Aliquots (200 \u03bcl) of the isopropanol supernatant were added in triplicate to a 96-well plate and the absorbance was read at 570 and 630 nm using a SPECTRAMAX 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The difference in absorbance at 570 and 630 nm was calculated and the viability of the fibroblasts was expressed as percent to sham-exposed controls. The EC50 (effective m-xylene concentration at which 50% cell viability was observed) of the viability curves was determined from each of the four independent experiments using non-linear (sigmoid, three parameter) regression analysis (SigmaPlot, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL).Endogenous catalase and thiols assays The determination of protein levels was used for normalization between individual dermal equivalents. Following exposure, individual lattices were placed in separate wells of a 24-well plate, washed twice for 15 min in PBS (pH 7.4), placed in microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 \u03bcl of PBS, sonicated on ice for 5\u201310 s and centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the protein levels were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were read on a SPECTRAMAX 190 microplate reader at 562 nm and protein values were derived from a standard curve. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to cell viability assays, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with sulfhydryl compounds. While sulfhydryl compounds are often involved in redox reactions and may interact with various organic compounds, the context does not provide specific evidence or details linking 1,3-xylene to sulfhydryl compounds or their biological significance together.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,3-xylene and sulfhydryl compounds in the provided context. They are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
