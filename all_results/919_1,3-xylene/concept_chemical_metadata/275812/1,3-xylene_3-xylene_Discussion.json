    "context": "However, the observed significant decrease in cellular thiols and catalase from 1 to 4 h suggests that free radicals may be formed with increasing chemical concentration and exposure time, leading to depletion of thiols and catalase. Moreover, supplementation of the dermal equivalents with catalase or NAC appears to partially inhibit m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting oxidative stress may play a role in the cytotoxic effect of m-xylene in rat dermal fibroblasts. Further studies on other antioxidant and/or cytotoxic mechanisms that play a role in the m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity need to be explored in order to understand the mechanism(s) underlying m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity in rat dermal fibroblasts. Once these mechanisms are known, it could be possible to develop therapeutic treatments for inhibiting or preventing the irritating effects of m-xylene and other VOCs.  [1] Glutathione S-transferases (GST) constitute a superfamily of enzymes with diversified functions including detoxification from xenobiotics.  [2] In many human cancers, Pi class GST (GSTP1-1) is overexpressed and contributes to multidrug resistance by conjugating chemotherapeutics.  [3] In addition, GSTP1-1 displays antiapoptotic activity by interacting with c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, a key regulator of apoptosis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene, but the focus is primarily on m-xylene (which is 1,2-xylene) and its cytotoxic effects on rat dermal fibroblasts. The study discusses the oxidative stress induced by m-xylene, suggesting that while 1,3-xylene is mentioned, its specific relationship to the observed effects of m-xylene is not directly explored. The mention of both compounds indicates they belong to the same chemical family, but their individual roles in the context are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene, but the context primarily discusses m-xylene's effects without detailing the relationship or interactions between the two isomers.",
