    "context": "However, a problem that occurs while conducting in vitro exposures with VOCs is chemical evaporation from the exposure medium. This evaporation can ultimately result in decreasing chemical concentration throughout the exposure period, potentially affecting specific endpoint values. Our laboratory has previously developed an exposure method for assessing the dermal toxicity of VOCs, which maintains a constant chemical dose throughout the exposure period and enables calculation of chemical dose in the cells, not just the exposure medium (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). Xylene is considered an irritant and we have previously observed m-xylene-induced oxidative species formation in whole skin (Rogers et al., 2001), therefore the purpose of this study was to determine whether oxidative stress plays a role in the cytotoxic effect of m-xylene in rat dermal fibroblasts. This study will aid in the evaluation of our previously developed exposure method for VOCs by monitoring the time- and dose-dependent relationships of specific toxicological endpoints. Cell culture Male Fischer F-344 rat dermal fibroblasts were grown in Ham's F-12/DMEM without Phenol red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C under 95% air and 5% CO2. Cultures maintained through ten passages were used for exposures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) related to the study of dermal toxicity and oxidative stress. However, the specific relationship between these two is not elaborated upon, as the focus is primarily on m-xylene's effects. The mention of xylene as an irritant suggests a general category of compounds rather than a direct interaction or comparison between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both compounds are categorized under xylene isomers and are discussed in the context of VOCs, but there is no detailed exploration of their specific interactions or differences in the study.",
