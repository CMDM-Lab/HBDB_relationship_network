    "context": "Data were normalized to protein and expressed as a percent of sham-exposed controls.NAC and catalase pre-treatment To determine whether antioxidants may protect against m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity, dermal equivalents were pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or catalase prior to m-xylene exposure. The dermal equivalents were incubated with 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC (Sigma) or 1000 U/ml catalase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for 16\u201318 h. Following antioxidant treatment, dermal equivalents were exposed to m-xylene for 1 or 4 h and assessed for viability as described above. Catalase (1000 U/ml) was also present during exposure to m-xylene. To determine whether the concentrations of NAC or catalase used were toxic to the fibroblasts, additional exposures were conducted using only NAC or catalase. Dermal equivalents were exposed to 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC or 1000 U/ml catalase for 18 h. At the end of exposure, the tissues were assessed for viability using the MTT assay and compared to sham-exposed (medium only) controls.Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean\u00b1S.E.M. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene mentioned in relation to m-xylene exposure and its cytotoxic effects on dermal equivalents. However, the context primarily focuses on m-xylene and the protective effects of antioxidants against its toxicity, without detailing any specific interactions or comparisons between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene. Their mention is more about their classification as xylene isomers rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene mentioned in the same context, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or specific interactions. They are connected only through their classification.",
