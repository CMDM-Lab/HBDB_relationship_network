    "context": "The incinerator was supplied 10\u00a0L/min of air flow rate. A thermocouple was used to detect the inner temperature of the incinerator. The ash ratios of AC were also determined. Ten gram wood-based AC (DDG-480, Kaya Activated Carbon, Inc., Korea) saturated with toluene, m-xylene, and ethylbenzene were investigated, respectively. AC was pre-burnt by a gas torch. Composition ratios of VOCs emitted from coating materials In terms of marine SCMs, the most abundant VOCs were toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. m/p-Xylene was the most abundant target VOCs among marine SCMs (Table\u00a0S2).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with emissions from coating materials. They are part of a broader discussion on the composition ratios of VOCs emitted, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the study of air quality and pollution from marine SCMs. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,3-xylene and toluene are both identified as VOCs in the same context, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interactions beyond their shared classification as VOCs.",
