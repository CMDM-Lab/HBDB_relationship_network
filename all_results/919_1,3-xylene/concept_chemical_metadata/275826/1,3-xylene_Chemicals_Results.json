    "context": "Cell viability was not affected by maintaining dermal equivalents in a sealed vial for 4 h. A comparison between sham-exposed dermal equivalents at 0 and 4 h in sealed vials showed no significant difference in viability. Dermal equivalent viability at 4 h was 101\u00b13.2% of 0 h controls. To demonstrate the effect of chemical evaporation from the exposure medium on viability, dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene in unsealed 24- and 48-well culture plates and sealed vials were assessed using the MTT assay (Table 2 ). The dermal equivalents in the culture plates and sealed vials were exposed to similar initial (\u223c235 \u03bcg/ml) m-xylene concentrations. By 4 h, this exposure medium m-xylene concentration decreased in 24- (19.2\u00b10.64 \u03bcg/ml) and 48-well (33.4\u00b11.75 \u03bcg/ml) plates, but remained at 224.5\u00b10.3 \u03bcg/ml in the sealed vials. Although cell viability in 24- and 48-well plates had decreased to \u223c20\u201330% of sham-exposed controls, respectively, these values were 4\u20136-fold higher than the viability observed in dermal equivalents exposed in sealed vials.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a specific chemical being tested for its effects on dermal equivalents in a study assessing cell viability. The study compares the impact of chemical evaporation from exposure mediums containing m-xylene, which is a related compound, indicating that 1,3-xylene is part of a broader category of chemicals being evaluated for their biological effects. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its classification as a chemical under investigation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,3-xylene is identified as a chemical in the study, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or effects compared to other chemicals. Its mention is more about its classification rather than a significant relationship.",
        "score": 2
