    "context": "The difference in absorbance at 570 and 630 nm was determined and the viability was expressed as a percentage of sham-exposed controls. Additional exposures were performed to determine whether maintaining the dermal equivalents in a sealed vial for 4 h would affect cell viability. Sham-exposed dermal equivalents were incubated for 0 or 4 h in sealed 2.0 ml exposure vials assessed for cell viability using the MTT assay described above. The viability of dermal equivalents at 4 h was expressed as a percentage of the 0 h controls.Fibroblast m-xylene concentrations The medium:air and fibroblast:air partition coefficients for m-xylene were used to calculate target cellular chemical concentration. The m-xylene concentration in the fibroblasts of the dermal equivalents was calculated with the following formula: C c =(PC f/m )(C m ), where C c is the m-xylene concentration in the dermal fibroblasts (\u03bcg m-xylene/g cells), PCf/m is the fibroblast:medium partition coefficient ratio for m-xylene, and C m is the m-xylene concentration in the exposure medium (\u03bcg/ml) as determined by GC analysis at the end of the 4-h exposure. Dermal equivalent viability was plotted vs. the calculated C c. The EC50 was determined using non-linear regression analysis (SigmaPlot, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) of viability curves from three independent experiments.Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a specific chemical being studied for its effects on cell viability in dermal equivalents. The study involves calculating the concentration of m-xylene in fibroblasts and assessing its impact on cell viability using the MTT assay. While 1,3-xylene is a type of chemical, the context does not elaborate on its broader relationship with other chemicals, focusing instead on its specific role in the experiment.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,3-xylene is identified as a chemical of interest in the study, but the context does not provide detailed interactions or comparisons with other chemicals, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
        "score": 2
