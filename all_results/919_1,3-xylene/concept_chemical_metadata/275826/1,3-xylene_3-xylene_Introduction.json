    "context": "We needed to develop a system that maintains a constant chemical dose and enables calculation of the VOC concentration in the cultured cells. Knowing the chemical concentration in the target cells during in vitro exposures is necessary to characterize the relationship between the chemical concentration and observed biological response(s). In a sealed exposure system as described in this paper, there is a relationship between exposure medium and cell concentrations after equilibrium is reached. The partition coefficient (the ratio of concentrations between two different phases at equilibrium) for m-xylene can be used to calculate the chemical concentration in the target cells. If the target cell/tissue dose that causes toxicity is known, biologically-based mathematical models can be used to predict exposures on the skin surface that would cause the toxicity (Ramsey and Andersen, 1984; McDougal et al., 1986). Cell culture Male Fischer F-344 rat primary dermal fibroblasts were obtained from skin explants (kindly provided by Carol Garrett, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH) as previously described (Bell et al., 1981). The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12/DMEM without phenol red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C under 95% air and 5% CO2.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to a study on chemical exposure in cultured cells. However, the text does not provide specific details about their individual properties, interactions, or comparative significance. They are part of a broader discussion on the relationship between chemical concentrations and biological responses, but no direct relationship between the two xylene isomers is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both categorized as VOCs in the same study, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or explored beyond their inclusion in the context of chemical exposure.",
        "score": 2
