    "context": "We needed to develop a system that maintains a constant chemical dose and enables calculation of the VOC concentration in the cultured cells. Knowing the chemical concentration in the target cells during in vitro exposures is necessary to characterize the relationship between the chemical concentration and observed biological response(s). In a sealed exposure system as described in this paper, there is a relationship between exposure medium and cell concentrations after equilibrium is reached. The partition coefficient (the ratio of concentrations between two different phases at equilibrium) for m-xylene can be used to calculate the chemical concentration in the target cells. If the target cell/tissue dose that causes toxicity is known, biologically-based mathematical models can be used to predict exposures on the skin surface that would cause the toxicity (Ramsey and Andersen, 1984; McDougal et al., 1986). Cell culture Male Fischer F-344 rat primary dermal fibroblasts were obtained from skin explants (kindly provided by Carol Garrett, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH) as previously described (Bell et al., 1981). The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12/DMEM without phenol red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C under 95% air and 5% CO2.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) within a broader discussion about chemicals used in a system designed to maintain constant chemical doses for in vitro exposure studies. The focus is on understanding the relationship between chemical concentrations and biological responses, indicating that 1,3-xylene is part of the larger category of chemicals being studied for their effects on cultured cells. However, there is no detailed exploration of its specific properties or interactions beyond its classification as a chemical.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,3-xylene is categorized as a chemical in the context of VOCs, but there is no direct discussion of its unique properties or interactions with other chemicals or biological systems.",
