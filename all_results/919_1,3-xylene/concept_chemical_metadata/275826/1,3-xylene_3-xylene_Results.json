    "context": "Dermal equivalent viability at 4 h was 101\u00b13.2% of 0 h controls. To demonstrate the effect of chemical evaporation from the exposure medium on viability, dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene in unsealed 24- and 48-well culture plates and sealed vials were assessed using the MTT assay (Table 2 ). The dermal equivalents in the culture plates and sealed vials were exposed to similar initial (\u223c235 \u03bcg/ml) m-xylene concentrations. By 4 h, this exposure medium m-xylene concentration decreased in 24- (19.2\u00b10.64 \u03bcg/ml) and 48-well (33.4\u00b11.75 \u03bcg/ml) plates, but remained at 224.5\u00b10.3 \u03bcg/ml in the sealed vials. Although cell viability in 24- and 48-well plates had decreased to \u223c20\u201330% of sham-exposed controls, respectively, these values were 4\u20136-fold higher than the viability observed in dermal equivalents exposed in sealed vials. Various in vitro exposure systems, ranging from sealed and unsealed containers to open-lid cultures maintained in a larger closed chamber, have been developed to evaluate the toxicity of volatile chemicals in a variety of tissues (Costa and Trudell, 1988; Kedderis and Held, 1996; M\u00fcckter et al., 1998; DelRaso and Channel, 1999; Geiss and Frazier, 2001; G\u00fclden et al., 2001; Lantz et al., 2001). Studies exposing cultured cells to VOCs have provided data for describing the mechanistic and cytotoxic effects of these chemicals. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to the study of dermal equivalent viability under chemical exposure. However, the text primarily focuses on m-xylene and its effects on cell viability, with no direct comparison or interaction between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene discussed. Their relationship is implied through their classification as xylene isomers, but no specific functional or experimental connection is established.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both categorized as xylene isomers but are not directly compared or discussed in relation to each other in the context provided. Their mention is coincidental rather than indicative of a significant relationship.",
