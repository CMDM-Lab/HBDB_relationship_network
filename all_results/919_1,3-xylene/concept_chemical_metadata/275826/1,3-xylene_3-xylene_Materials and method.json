    "context": "The EC50 was determined using non-linear regression analysis (SigmaPlot, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) of viability curves from three independent experiments.Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. The one-way ANOVA and t-test (Statistica, Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) were used for data analysis. The effect of time or different m-xylene concentrations on partition coefficient determination was compared using the one-way ANOVA. The t-test compared changes in m-xylene concentration in sealed exposure vials at 0.08 or 4 h with the 0-h samples. P<0.05 was used as the level for significance. Media concentrations of m-xylene Measurements of m-xylene concentration in unsealed 24- and 48-well culture plates showed a temporal decrease in the exposure medium m-xylene concentration (Fig. 3 ). In 24-well plates, the initial medium m-xylene concentration of 119.2\u00b12.2 \u03bcg/ml decreased to 82.85\u00b11.07 ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as isomers of xylene, but there is no direct discussion of their specific relationship or interactions. The focus is primarily on m-xylene concentrations and their effects in experimental setups, without elaborating on the differences or similarities between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene. Thus, they appear in the same context but without a clear connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are merely mentioned in the context of xylene studies without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
