    "context": "The BTX standards were transferred to sorbent tubes as previously described. The procedure involved the injection of the required amount of the BTX standard to the stream of carrier gas flowing towards the sorbent tube (Fig. 2b). Concentration ranges of the injected BTX standard are listed in Table A.1. The peak areas of target compounds were divided by calibration slopes generated from the cylinder gas standards (refer to Table A.2). Linearity of the system was excellent with R 2 values greater than 0.98 for all three compounds (Table A.2). Precision, if expressed in terms of relative standard error (RSE) values, was excellent at \u223c1% for benzene and toluene and less than 3% for m-xylene (Table A.2).Temperature-based permeation rate adjustment and calculation of generated gas standard concentrations The permeation rate values are initially given by the manufacturer for each target compound at each respective reference temperature (Table 1). Hence, their new permeation rate values were adjusted to our experimental conditions (30\u00b0C) which were approximated by the following equation (VICI Metronics Dynacalibrator Model 150 Instruction Manual): (1) log \u2009 P = log \u2009 P 0 +( T \u2212 T 0 ) where P 0 =rate at a reference temperature (T 0); P =rate at adjusted temperature (T); log=log base 10. Eq. (1) is expected to be valid in the temperature range of 30\u2013110\u00b0C as suggested by VICI Metronics Inc.. The new temperature-based adjustment for permeation rate values were 698 (B), 376 (T), and 91ngmin\u22121 (X) at 30\u00b0C (Table 1). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as part of the BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) standards used in a calibration procedure for gas analysis. However, there is no specific discussion of their individual properties, interactions, or significance beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework. They are treated as part of a group of compounds without detailed exploration of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are mentioned together in the context of BTX standards but lack a detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
