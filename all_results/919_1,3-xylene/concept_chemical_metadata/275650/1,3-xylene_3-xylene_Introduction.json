    "context": "The broadness of chemicals available in PT devices also eliminates the need for multiple expensive gas cylinders, thereby saving space and removing a safety hazard. However, the advantages mentioned need to be critically evaluated by end-users, as there is a lack of evidence and data to support the accuracy and reliability of PT devices. In this study, we evaluated the reliability of a PT device by comparing theoretically predictable and actually measured permeation rate values. To this end, we investigated the performance of PT devices for three target analytes consisting of benzene (B), toluene (T), and m-xylene (X) (i.e., BTX). Upon discovering that permeation rate values given by the manufacturer (MPR) were not matching with actual permeation rate (APR) measured by the end user, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to assess the level of experimental bias in the acquisition of permeation rate values using flow rate as the key variable. Based on the APR, we developed equations for PPR to replace the MPR equations and overcome the basic experimental bias in PT application. PT device and dynacalibrator system To carry out this comparative experiment, dynacal PT devices with Teflon tubes were purchased from Valco Instruments Co. Inc. (VICI Metronics Inc., USA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as part of a broader discussion on the performance of permeation testing (PT) devices for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, there is no specific interaction or relationship detailed between the two isomers. They are included in a list of target analytes (BTX) but are not compared or analyzed in relation to each other within the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are merely listed among other chemicals without any direct discussion of their interactions or significance in the context of the study.",
