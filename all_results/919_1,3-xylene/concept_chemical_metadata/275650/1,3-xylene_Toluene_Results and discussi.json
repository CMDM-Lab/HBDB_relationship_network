    "context": "The best fit power regression equation models for each compound were: (4) PPR \u2009 ( benzene ) = 518.44 FR\u2003 ( R 2 =) (5) PPR \u2009 ( toluene ) = 379.22 FR\u2003 ( R 2 =) (6) PPR \u2009 ( m-xylene ) = 132.7 FR\u2003 ( R 2 =) Noticeably, the curvilinear lines of APR and PPR are more proximate to each other than that of APR and MPR, although the former pairs tend to deviate from each other at certain flow rate for each of all 3 compounds (BTX), such as at 800 (with 8.46, 9.91, and 15.1% difference, respectively) and 1200mLmin\u22121 (with 8.56, 8.16, and 11.7% difference, respectively). The enormity of bias between PPR and MPR, when plotted against APR, tends to be reduced, especially in toluene and m-xylene (Fig. 5 ). The size of relative bias for PPR computed against APR decreased greatly from the highest (1200mLmin\u22121) to the lowest flow rate (20mLmin\u22121) such as 8.56\u20131.20% (B), 8.16\u20131.59% (T), and 11.7\u20138.09% ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and toluene are both mentioned as part of a study analyzing the performance of different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in relation to flow rates and regression models. While they are included in the same analysis, the context does not provide specific details about their direct interactions or comparative significance, focusing instead on their individual regression equations and relative biases in measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 1,3-xylene and toluene are both part of the same study on VOCs, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the analysis.",
