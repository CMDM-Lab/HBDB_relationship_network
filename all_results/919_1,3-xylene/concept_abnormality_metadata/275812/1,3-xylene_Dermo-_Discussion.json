    "context": "The results of the present study show that m-xylene induces cytotoxicity and promotes decreases in cellular antioxidants (thiols and catalase) in fibroblasts in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cytotoxicity observed at high chemical concentrations in which there was an observed marginal decrease (\u224810\u201320%) in endogenous levels of thiols and catalase may result from cellular damage other than oxidative stress. However, the observed significant decrease in cellular thiols and catalase from 1 to 4 h suggests that free radicals may be formed with increasing chemical concentration and exposure time, leading to depletion of thiols and catalase. Moreover, supplementation of the dermal equivalents with catalase or NAC appears to partially inhibit m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting oxidative stress may play a role in the cytotoxic effect of m-xylene in rat dermal fibroblasts. Further studies on other antioxidant and/or cytotoxic mechanisms that play a role in the m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity need to be explored in order to understand the mechanism(s) underlying m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity in rat dermal fibroblasts. Once these mechanisms are known, it could be possible to develop therapeutic treatments for inhibiting or preventing the irritating effects of m-xylene and other VOCs.  [1] Glutathione S-transferases (GST) constitute a superfamily of enzymes with diversified functions including detoxification from xenobiotics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is linked to dermal effects through its cytotoxicity in fibroblasts, where it induces a decrease in cellular antioxidants like thiols and catalase. The study suggests that oxidative stress may contribute to the cytotoxic effects of 1,3-xylene on dermal cells, indicating a potential relationship between the chemical and dermal health. However, the term 'Dermo-' is not explicitly defined or elaborated upon in the context, limiting the depth of the relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 1,3-xylene's cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts are discussed in relation to dermal health, but the term 'Dermo-' lacks specific context or detailed exploration, preventing a stronger connection.",
