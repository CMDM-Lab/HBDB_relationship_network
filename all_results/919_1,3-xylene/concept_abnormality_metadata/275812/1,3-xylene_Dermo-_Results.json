    "context": "The viability of cells exposed to 1000 U/ml catalase was 98.3\u00b12.1% of sham-exposed controls. When compared to m-xylene exposures, pretreatment with either 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC led to significant increases (P<0.05) in the EC50 values at 1 and 4 h (Table 1). Increases in these EC50 values ranged from 1.22- to 1.32-fold at 1 h and 1.27- to 1.54-fold at 4 h. Although pre-treatment with catalase led to a 1.35-fold increase in cell viability at 1 h, no significant differences were observed at either 1 or 4 h when compared to dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene alone. Exposure methods have been developed for in vitro assessment of volatile chemical-induced cytotoxicity (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). The headspace and culture medium volume, chemical solubility and chemical partitioning affect VOC dosimetry. A problem with conducting in vitro exposures using VOCs is maintaining these chemicals in solution to achieve a uniform exposure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to its cytotoxic effects on cells, while 'Dermo-' likely refers to dermal exposure or dermal equivalents used in the study. The study assesses the viability of cells exposed to various conditions, including m-xylene and catalase treatment, but does not provide a direct relationship between 1,3-xylene and dermal exposure. The focus is more on the effects of xylene on cell viability rather than a specific interaction with dermal exposure methods.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related to the study of cytotoxicity and exposure methods, but there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interaction.",
