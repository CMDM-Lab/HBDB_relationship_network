    "context": "However, a problem that occurs while conducting in vitro exposures with VOCs is chemical evaporation from the exposure medium. This evaporation can ultimately result in decreasing chemical concentration throughout the exposure period, potentially affecting specific endpoint values. Our laboratory has previously developed an exposure method for assessing the dermal toxicity of VOCs, which maintains a constant chemical dose throughout the exposure period and enables calculation of chemical dose in the cells, not just the exposure medium (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). Xylene is considered an irritant and we have previously observed m-xylene-induced oxidative species formation in whole skin (Rogers et al., 2001), therefore the purpose of this study was to determine whether oxidative stress plays a role in the cytotoxic effect of m-xylene in rat dermal fibroblasts. This study will aid in the evaluation of our previously developed exposure method for VOCs by monitoring the time- and dose-dependent relationships of specific toxicological endpoints. Cell culture Male Fischer F-344 rat dermal fibroblasts were grown in Ham's F-12/DMEM without Phenol red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C under 95% air and 5% CO2. Cultures maintained through ten passages were used for exposures. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can induce oxidative stress, particularly in the study of dermal toxicity. However, there is no direct mention or exploration of Roger's disease in relation to 1,3-xylene. The focus is primarily on the chemical's irritant properties and its effects on rat dermal fibroblasts, without establishing a clear connection to Roger's disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between 1,3-xylene and Roger's disease, as the context discusses xylene's toxicity without linking it to the disease or its mechanisms.",
