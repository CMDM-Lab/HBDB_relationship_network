    "context": "Samples (100 \u03bcl) of the cellular preps from the dermal equivalents were placed on a 96-well plate in triplicate, 200 \u03bcl of DTNB was added to each well, the absorbance was immediately read at 412 nm. Data were normalized to protein and expressed as a percent of sham-exposed controls.NAC and catalase pre-treatment To determine whether antioxidants may protect against m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity, dermal equivalents were pretreated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or catalase prior to m-xylene exposure. The dermal equivalents were incubated with 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC (Sigma) or 1000 U/ml catalase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) for 16\u201318 h. Following antioxidant treatment, dermal equivalents were exposed to m-xylene for 1 or 4 h and assessed for viability as described above. Catalase (1000 U/ml) was also present during exposure to m-xylene. To determine whether the concentrations of NAC or catalase used were toxic to the fibroblasts, additional exposures were conducted using only NAC or catalase. Dermal equivalents were exposed to 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC or 1000 U/ml catalase for 18 h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to dermal equivalents, which are used to study the cytotoxic effects of m-xylene exposure. The study investigates whether antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or catalase can protect these dermal equivalents from the cytotoxicity induced by m-xylene. While 1,3-xylene is part of the broader category of xylene compounds, the specific relationship to dermal equivalents is indirect, focusing more on the effects of m-xylene rather than a direct interaction with 1,3-xylene itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene and dermal equivalents are connected through the study of m-xylene's effects, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or specific interactions.",
