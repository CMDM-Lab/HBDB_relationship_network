    "context": "The medium m-xylene concentration (determined from a standard curve) was expressed as \u03bcg/ml. The dermal equivalents were removed from each vial and assessed for cell viability or protein content and levels of cellular thiols and catalase activity.Fibroblast m-xylene concentration The m-xylene concentration in the fibroblasts of the dermal equivalents was determined as previously described using partition coefficients (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). The use of partition coefficients enables calculation of chemical concentration in the fibroblasts once the exposure medium chemical concentration is determined by GC analysis. The fibroblast:medium partition coefficient for m-xylene was previously found to be 17.9 (Rogers and McDougal, 2002), which means the cellular m-xylene concentration (\u03bcg m-xylene/g cells) is \u224817.9 times higher than the media m-xylene concentration (\u03bcg m-xylene/ml). The formula C c=(PC f/m)(C m) calculates the cellular m-xylene concentration (C c) as \u03bcg m-xylene/g cells using the fibroblast:medium partition coefficient for m-xylene (PC f/m) and the exposure medium m-xylene concentration (C m) as determined by GC analysis at the end of the 1- or 4-h exposure.Cell viability The viability of the fibroblasts in the dermal equivalents was determined by measuring the reduction of tetrazolium dye MTT in active mitochondria (Mosmann, 1983). Following chemical exposure, the dermal equivalents were incubated separately in 500 \u03bcl of 0.5 mg/ml MTT in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, each dermal equivalent was placed in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 700 \u03bcl of acidified isopropanol. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is discussed in relation to its concentration in fibroblasts and its effects on cell viability and biochemical activity. However, there is no mention or implication of Roger's disease, which is a specific condition. The relationship between 1,3-xylene and Roger's disease is not established or explored, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that while 1,3-xylene is analyzed in terms of its cellular effects, there is no discussion or connection to Roger's disease, making their relationship coincidental at best.",
