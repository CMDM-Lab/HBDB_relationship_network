    "context": "A comparison between sham-exposed dermal equivalents at 0 and 4 h in sealed vials showed no significant difference in viability. Dermal equivalent viability at 4 h was 101\u00b13.2% of 0 h controls. To demonstrate the effect of chemical evaporation from the exposure medium on viability, dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene in unsealed 24- and 48-well culture plates and sealed vials were assessed using the MTT assay (Table 2 ). The dermal equivalents in the culture plates and sealed vials were exposed to similar initial (\u223c235 \u03bcg/ml) m-xylene concentrations. By 4 h, this exposure medium m-xylene concentration decreased in 24- (19.2\u00b10.64 \u03bcg/ml) and 48-well (33.4\u00b11.75 \u03bcg/ml) plates, but remained at 224.5\u00b10.3 \u03bcg/ml in the sealed vials. Although cell viability in 24- and 48-well plates had decreased to \u223c20\u201330% of sham-exposed controls, respectively, these values were 4\u20136-fold higher than the viability observed in dermal equivalents exposed in sealed vials. Various in vitro exposure systems, ranging from sealed and unsealed containers to open-lid cultures maintained in a larger closed chamber, have been developed to evaluate the toxicity of volatile chemicals in a variety of tissues (Costa and Trudell, 1988; Kedderis and Held, 1996; M\u00fcckter et al., 1998; DelRaso and Channel, 1999; Geiss and Frazier, 2001; G\u00fclden et al., 2001; Lantz et al., 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a volatile chemical used in dermal equivalent toxicity assessments. The study compares the viability of dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene in different exposure systems. However, there is no direct relationship established between 1,3-xylene and the term 'Dermo-', which appears to refer to dermal equivalents without further elaboration on their interaction or significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 1,3-xylene is part of a study involving dermal equivalents, but the relationship is not explicitly detailed. They share a general context of toxicity assessment, but no specific interaction is discussed.",
