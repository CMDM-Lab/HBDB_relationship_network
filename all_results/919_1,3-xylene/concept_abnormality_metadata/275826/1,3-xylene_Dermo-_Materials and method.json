    "context": "Additional exposures were performed to determine whether maintaining the dermal equivalents in a sealed vial for 4 h would affect cell viability. Sham-exposed dermal equivalents were incubated for 0 or 4 h in sealed 2.0 ml exposure vials assessed for cell viability using the MTT assay described above. The viability of dermal equivalents at 4 h was expressed as a percentage of the 0 h controls.Fibroblast m-xylene concentrations The medium:air and fibroblast:air partition coefficients for m-xylene were used to calculate target cellular chemical concentration. The m-xylene concentration in the fibroblasts of the dermal equivalents was calculated with the following formula: C c =(PC f/m )(C m ), where C c is the m-xylene concentration in the dermal fibroblasts (\u03bcg m-xylene/g cells), PCf/m is the fibroblast:medium partition coefficient ratio for m-xylene, and C m is the m-xylene concentration in the exposure medium (\u03bcg/ml) as determined by GC analysis at the end of the 4-h exposure. Dermal equivalent viability was plotted vs. the calculated C c. The EC50 was determined using non-linear regression analysis (SigmaPlot, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) of viability curves from three independent experiments.Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. The one-way ANOVA and t-test (Statistica, Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) were used for data analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is evaluated for its effects on dermal equivalents, specifically assessing cell viability after exposure. The study calculates the concentration of m-xylene in fibroblasts within these dermal equivalents, indicating a direct relationship between the chemical exposure and the biological response of the dermal cells. The analysis aims to understand how 1,3-xylene impacts cell viability in a controlled environment, highlighting its relevance in dermal toxicity studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,3-xylene and dermal equivalents, as the study quantitatively assesses the impact of xylene exposure on cell viability, providing clear evidence of interaction within a biological context.",
        "score": 4
