    "context": "We have previously observed such a temporal decrease in m-xylene from the culture medium in unsealed 24- and 48-well culture plates (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). This decrease in chemical concentration resulted in viability values that were 4- to 6-fold higher than viability values determined using our sealed system (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). The present study utilized a sealed exposure method previously developed in our laboratory to examine the effect of m-xylene exposure on dermal fibroblast viability and depletion of cellular antioxidants. Our results show that dermal fibroblasts exposed to m-xylene for 1 or 4 h exhibited a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cellular viability and endogenous thiols and catalase activity. Moreover, NAC pretreatment of dermal equivalents led to significant increases in cellular viability, while catalase pretreatment promoted a marginal, but non-significant increase in cell viability. Chemical exposure can deplete endogenous cellular thiol levels, leading to a decrease in cellular viability (Stanislawski et al., 2000; Cereser et al., 2001; Chang et al., 2001; Chiba et al., 2001; Chang et al., 2002). Endogenous thiols can protect cells from oxidative stress by direct free radical quenching. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene exposure is linked to a decrease in catalase activity in dermal fibroblasts. The study indicates that exposure to m-xylene results in a time- and dose-dependent reduction in cellular viability and endogenous antioxidants, including catalase. While catalase pretreatment showed a marginal increase in cell viability, it was not statistically significant, suggesting that the relationship between 1,3-xylene and catalase activity is relevant but not strongly impactful in terms of protective effects against oxidative stress.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,3-xylene exposure and catalase activity, supported by evidence of decreased catalase levels in response to chemical exposure. However, the lack of a strong protective effect from catalase pretreatment limits the relationship's strength.",
