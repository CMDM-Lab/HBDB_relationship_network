    "context": "The viability of cells exposed to 1000 U/ml catalase was 98.3\u00b12.1% of sham-exposed controls. When compared to m-xylene exposures, pretreatment with either 1.0 or 5.0 mM NAC led to significant increases (P<0.05) in the EC50 values at 1 and 4 h (Table 1). Increases in these EC50 values ranged from 1.22- to 1.32-fold at 1 h and 1.27- to 1.54-fold at 4 h. Although pre-treatment with catalase led to a 1.35-fold increase in cell viability at 1 h, no significant differences were observed at either 1 or 4 h when compared to dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene alone. Exposure methods have been developed for in vitro assessment of volatile chemical-induced cytotoxicity (Rogers and McDougal, 2002). The headspace and culture medium volume, chemical solubility and chemical partitioning affect VOC dosimetry. A problem with conducting in vitro exposures using VOCs is maintaining these chemicals in solution to achieve a uniform exposure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is evaluated for its impact on cell survival in an in vitro study. The viability of cells exposed to 1,3-xylene is indirectly assessed through comparisons with m-xylene exposures and the effects of pretreatment with catalase and NAC. The study indicates that pretreatment can enhance cell viability, suggesting that 1,3-xylene exposure may influence cell survival, although the specific effects of 1,3-xylene alone are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the study discusses the effects of 1,3-xylene on cell survival in the context of cytotoxicity assessments, but does not provide extensive details on its direct impact compared to other compounds.",
