    "context": "Fibroblasts exposed to iron, nicotine or codeinone were not protected against cytotoxicity by catalase, but some protection was observed by using hydroxyl radical scavengers (such as NAC), suggesting that hydroxyl radicals may be primarily responsible for the observed cytotoxicity (Pu et al., 2001; Kawase et al., 2002). This could be an explanation for the results we observed in this study with respect to m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity in which NAC provided better cytotoxic protection than catalase. Since NAC itself can bind and interact with free radicals, this protection may be due to the direct action of NAC. Moreover, since NAC is a constituent used for GSH synthesis, protection against m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity could also be due to an increase in cellular GSH formed during the pretreatment of fibroblasts with NAC. Skin irritation following exposure to chemicals or UV light appears to be modulated in part by oxidative stress (Yasui and Sakurai, 2000; Willis et al., 2001). Antioxidants applied to the skin can inhibit or reduce the degree of dermal irritation caused by chemical or UV light exposure (Senaldi et al., 1994; Bangha et al., 1996; Fuchs and Kern, 1998; Lange et al., 1998; Katiyar et al., 1999; Dreher and Maibach, 2001). The VOC m-xylene is considered an irritant and exposure to m-xylene can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, as well as the formation of oxidative species and DNA damage (Steele and Wilhelm, 1966, 1970; Rogers et al., 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to its cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and skin irritation. However, the term 'Synthesis' does not have a direct connection to 1,3-xylene within the provided text. The focus is on the protective effects of NAC against m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity rather than any synthesis process involving 1,3-xylene.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between 1,3-xylene and synthesis, as the context discusses cytotoxicity and protective mechanisms without any mention of synthesis processes related to 1,3-xylene.",
