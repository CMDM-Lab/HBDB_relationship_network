    "context": "The vials and culture plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C under 95% air and 5% CO2. The medium m-xylene concentration in the culture plates was measured by GC in duplicate at 0, 0.08, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h. Samples were taken and measured by GC at 0.08 and 4 h from the sealed exposure vials. Additional 4-h exposures were done to compare viability of dermal equivalents exposed in unsealed culture plates and sealed vials.Cell viability The viability of dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene was assessed by measuring reduction of the tetrazolium dye MTT [3-(4,5 dimethyiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] in active mitochondria (Mosmann, 1983). Following the 4-h exposure to m-xylene, each dermal equivalent was incubated in 500 \u03bcl of 0.5 mg/ml MTT in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, the dermal equivalents were individually placed in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 700 \u03bcl of acidified isopropanol. Each sample was sonicated for 5\u201310 s and centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g for 5 min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is examined for its effects on cell survival, specifically in dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene. The viability of these cells is assessed using the MTT assay, which measures mitochondrial activity as an indicator of cell health. The study focuses on how exposure to m-xylene impacts cell survival over a defined time period, suggesting a direct relationship between the chemical exposure and cellular viability.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,3-xylene and cell survival, as the study quantitatively assesses the impact of m-xylene exposure on cell viability using a well-established assay. This indicates a clear relationship within the context of cellular responses to chemical exposure.",
        "score": 4
