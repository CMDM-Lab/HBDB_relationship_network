    "context": "Dermal equivalent viability was plotted vs. the calculated C c. The EC50 was determined using non-linear regression analysis (SigmaPlot, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL) of viability curves from three independent experiments.Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. The one-way ANOVA and t-test (Statistica, Statsoft, Tulsa, OK) were used for data analysis. The effect of time or different m-xylene concentrations on partition coefficient determination was compared using the one-way ANOVA. The t-test compared changes in m-xylene concentration in sealed exposure vials at 0.08 or 4 h with the 0-h samples. P<0.05 was used as the level for significance. Media concentrations of m-xylene Measurements of m-xylene concentration in unsealed 24- and 48-well culture plates showed a temporal decrease in the exposure medium m-xylene concentration (Fig. 3 ).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to statistical analysis of dermal equivalent viability and its concentration effects over time. However, there is no direct connection or relevance to the term 'Adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. The two terms appear in the same context but do not interact or relate meaningfully.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between 1,3-xylene and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
