    "context": "Within 1\u20132 h following exposure, organic solvents induce skin inflammation that is characterized by increased blood flow, vascular permeability, leukocyte infiltration into the skin, and epidermal degeneration (Steele and Wilhelm, 1966, 1970). For this study, we chose m-xylene as a representative VOC that is an industrial cleansing agent used in paints, thinners, and fuels. In skin, application of xylene results in plasma extravasation from the skin vasculature, leukocyte infiltration, epidermal degeneration, and increasing levels of oxidative species and low molecular-weight DNA levels (Von Burg, 1982; Iyadomi et al., 1998; Rogers et al., 2001). Dermal absorption of m-xylene leads to increased blood and tissue concentrations of m-xylene (Engstr\u00f6m et al., 1978; McDougal et al., 1990; Morgan et al., 1991; Kezic et al., 2000). The purpose of this study was to develop an in vitro exposure method that could ultimately be used with a biologically-based model to evaluate the toxicity and irritancy potential of VOCs. We needed to develop a system that maintains a constant chemical dose and enables calculation of the VOC concentration in the cultured cells. Knowing the chemical concentration in the target cells during in vitro exposures is necessary to characterize the relationship between the chemical concentration and observed biological response(s).

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is discussed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that, like m-xylene, can induce skin inflammation and is absorbed through the skin. The study highlights the effects of xylene exposure, including increased blood and tissue concentrations, leading to inflammatory responses such as plasma extravasation and leukocyte infiltration. This suggests a direct relationship between 1,3-xylene and skin absorption, emphasizing the compound's potential irritancy and toxicity upon dermal exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,3-xylene and skin absorption, as the context discusses the biological effects of xylene exposure on skin and the resulting inflammatory responses, supported by multiple studies. However, the focus is primarily on m-xylene, which slightly limits the direct relevance to 1,3-xylene.",
