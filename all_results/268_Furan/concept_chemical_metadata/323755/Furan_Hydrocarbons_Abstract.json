    "context": "[1] Methods: Stool samples were collected from 35 patients with infectious diarrhoea and from six healthy controls. [2] Gaseous compounds were extracted from a headspace using solid phase microextraction and analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. [1] Results: Characteristic patterns of volatile gases were found for the main causes of infectious diarrhoea in hospitals. [2] Furan species without indoles indicated Clostridium difficile, ethyl dodecanoate indicated rotavirus, ammonia without ethyl dodecanoate suggested other enteric viruses, and the absence of hydrocarbons and terpenes indicated Campylobacter infection. [1] Diarrhoea due to infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. [2] In England and Wales, there are approximately 15 000 cases of Clostridium difficile infection per annum (www.PHLS.co.uk). [3] It is estimated that in an average sized district general hospital, 100 cases of C difficile infection can be expected each year with an extra annual cost of \u00c2\u00a3400 000 and 2100 lost bed days.

        "summary": "In this context, furan is identified as a specific volatile compound associated with Clostridium difficile infections, while hydrocarbons are mentioned in relation to their absence indicating a different type of infection (Campylobacter). The relationship is indirect, as furan is a specific compound within the broader category of hydrocarbons, but their connection is primarily through their presence or absence in the context of infectious diarrhoea diagnostics.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between furan and hydrocarbons, as furan is a specific type of volatile compound that falls under the broader category of hydrocarbons. However, the context does not provide a detailed interaction or functional relationship between the two.",
