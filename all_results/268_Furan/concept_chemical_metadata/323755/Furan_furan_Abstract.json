    "context": "[1] Methods: Stool samples were collected from 35 patients with infectious diarrhoea and from six healthy controls. [2] Gaseous compounds were extracted from a headspace using solid phase microextraction and analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. [1] Results: Characteristic patterns of volatile gases were found for the main causes of infectious diarrhoea in hospitals. [2] Furan species without indoles indicated Clostridium difficile, ethyl dodecanoate indicated rotavirus, ammonia without ethyl dodecanoate suggested other enteric viruses, and the absence of hydrocarbons and terpenes indicated Campylobacter infection. [1] Diarrhoea due to infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. [2] In England and Wales, there are approximately 15 000 cases of Clostridium difficile infection per annum (www.PHLS.co.uk). [3] It is estimated that in an average sized district general hospital, 100 cases of C difficile infection can be expected each year with an extra annual cost of \u00c2\u00a3400 000 and 2100 lost bed days.

        "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' refers to a specific volatile compound identified in the analysis of gaseous emissions from stool samples of patients with infectious diarrhoea. The presence of furan species is linked to Clostridium difficile infections, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for this specific pathogen. The term 'furan' is used interchangeably, emphasizing its significance in the context of diagnosing infectious diarrhoea.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between furan and Clostridium difficile, supported by evidence that furan species are indicative of this infection. The context highlights its relevance in identifying specific pathogens, demonstrating a clear relationship.",
