    "context": "\u00b0C). \u2022 Dioxin/furan production occurs at the combustion catalyst. \u2022 Catalytic and thermal oxidizers may be destroying dioxins fed from the ambient air. \u2022 Small variations in temperature cause large changes in the congener distribution of the dioxin and furan isomers. \u2022 Molar yields from the parent compounds fed to the oxidizers to the toxic equivalents of 2,3,7,8-TCDD are very small (10\u22129\u201310\u221213). \u2022 The oxidation of chlorinated VOCs with non-chlorinated VOCs reduces emissions of dioxins. Concern from both the public and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been directed at the formation and control of PCDDs/Fs from combustion systems. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' and 'furan' refer to the same chemical compound, highlighting its role in the production of dioxins during combustion processes. The text discusses how variations in temperature affect the distribution of dioxin and furan isomers, indicating that both terms are used interchangeably to describe the same substance involved in environmental concerns related to combustion emissions and toxicity.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 'Furan' and 'furan', as they are the same compound discussed in the context of dioxin production and environmental impact, emphasizing their relevance in the study of combustion emissions.",
