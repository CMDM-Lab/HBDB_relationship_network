    "context": "At the stack, a further redistribution of the congener occurs so that the major congeners are the hepta and octa dioxins and 1234678-HpCDF. It appears that a slight variation in temperature across the catalyst and across the heat exchanger contributes to a dramatic change in the dioxin and furan chemistry. There is virtually no production of four of the congeners (2 dioxins and 2 furans) across the platinum supported catalyst, but a large production of the rest of the congeners. The highest production is in the tetra through hexa furans, and in the 1234789-hepta furan (HpCDF). These data indicate that small variations in temperature apparently cause large changes in the congener distribution of the dioxin and furan isomers.Effect of non-chlorinated organics Van den Brink et al. (2000) found a reduction or elimination in by-products by removal of Cl from surface by the addition of alkanes. Comparing data using the same type of catalytic oxidizer with and without the addition of non-chlorinated VOCs, this phenomenon also occurred in this study. TEQ concentrations are shown in Fig. 11 with and without non-chlorinated VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' and 'Furans' are related as they both refer to chemical compounds involved in the production and distribution of dioxins and furans during catalytic processes. The text discusses how variations in temperature affect the chemistry of these compounds, indicating that they are part of the same chemical family and are influenced by similar environmental conditions. However, the relationship is primarily descriptive rather than indicating a direct interaction or functional significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both terms are discussed in relation to their production and behavior in catalytic processes, indicating a shared significance in the context of dioxin and furan chemistry, but lacking detailed interaction or functional analysis.",
