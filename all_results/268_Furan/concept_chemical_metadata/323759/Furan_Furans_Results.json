    "context": "3\u201311 are listed in Table 1 . An average of all the Pt and Pt/Pd congener distributions at an average inlet temperature of 439 \u00b0C is in Fig. 3. Hepta and octa dioxins and a hepta furan and octa furan dominate. At the lowest inlet temperature in the study (293 \u00b0C), the congener distribution is in Fig. 4a from the oxidation over a platinum-only catalyst, and again favors the hepta and octa dioxins, a hepta furan (1234678-HpCDF), and octa dioxin (OCDF). At 430 \u00b0C, over a platinum-only catalyst, Fig. 4b shows an entirely different congener pattern favoring the tetra through hexa furans (123678-HxCDF) and a hepta furan isomer (1234678-HpCDF). This is for a fixed bed unit with only TCE at 7 ppm in the feed. For the 454 \u00b0C Pt/Pd catalyst, the congener distribution is in Fig. 4c, and the predominant isomer is 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD. At 480 \u00b0C with Pt/Pd (Fig. 4d), all of the seven dioxin congeners are in significantly higher concentrations than the furans. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' and 'Furans' are mentioned in relation to their presence in the congener distributions of dioxins and furans during oxidation processes over different catalysts at varying temperatures. The text discusses specific isomers of furans that dominate at certain temperatures, indicating a direct relationship between the two terms as they refer to the same class of compounds, with 'Furan' being the singular form and 'Furans' the plural. Their relationship is significant as they are part of the same chemical family involved in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between Furan and Furans, as they are both discussed in the context of their roles in chemical reactions and distributions during the study. The mention of specific isomers and their dominance at various temperatures supports this relationship.",
        "score": 4
