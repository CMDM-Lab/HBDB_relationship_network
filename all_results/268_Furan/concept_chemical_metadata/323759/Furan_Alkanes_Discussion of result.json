    "context": "It appears that a slight variation in temperature across the catalyst and across the heat exchanger contributes to a dramatic change in the dioxin and furan chemistry. There is virtually no production of four of the congeners (2 dioxins and 2 furans) across the platinum supported catalyst, but a large production of the rest of the congeners. The highest production is in the tetra through hexa furans, and in the 1234789-hepta furan (HpCDF). These data indicate that small variations in temperature apparently cause large changes in the congener distribution of the dioxin and furan isomers.Effect of non-chlorinated organics Van den Brink et al. (2000) found a reduction or elimination in by-products by removal of Cl from surface by the addition of alkanes. Comparing data using the same type of catalytic oxidizer with and without the addition of non-chlorinated VOCs, this phenomenon also occurred in this study. TEQ concentrations are shown in Fig. 11 with and without non-chlorinated VOCs. Even at lower catalyst inlet temperatures, the TEQ emissions are much lower with the addition of the non-chlorinated VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, furan and alkanes are related through their roles in catalytic processes affecting the production of dioxins and furans. The study indicates that the addition of non-chlorinated organics, specifically alkanes, can reduce or eliminate by-products in the presence of catalysts. This suggests that alkanes may influence the chemistry of furan production, particularly in terms of emissions and congener distribution.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between furan and alkanes, as the context discusses how alkanes can affect the production of furan and dioxin congeners during catalytic processes, supported by experimental data on emissions.",
        "score": 4
