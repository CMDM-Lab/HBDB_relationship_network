    "context": "[1] Methods: Stool samples were collected from 35 patients with infectious diarrhoea and from six healthy controls. [2] Gaseous compounds were extracted from a headspace using solid phase microextraction and analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. [1] Results: Characteristic patterns of volatile gases were found for the main causes of infectious diarrhoea in hospitals. [2] Furan species without indoles indicated Clostridium difficile, ethyl dodecanoate indicated rotavirus, ammonia without ethyl dodecanoate suggested other enteric viruses, and the absence of hydrocarbons and terpenes indicated Campylobacter infection. [1] Diarrhoea due to infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. [2] In England and Wales, there are approximately 15 000 cases of Clostridium difficile infection per annum (www.PHLS.co.uk). [3] It is estimated that in an average sized district general hospital, 100 cases of C difficile infection can be expected each year with an extra annual cost of \u00c2\u00a3400 000 and 2100 lost bed days.

        "summary": "In this context, furan is identified as a volatile compound whose absence is associated with Campylobacter infection in patients with infectious diarrhea. The study highlights that specific gaseous patterns can indicate different causes of diarrhea, with the lack of hydrocarbons and terpenes serving as a marker for Campylobacter infection. This suggests a potential diagnostic role for furan in differentiating between types of infectious diarrhea.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between furan and Campylobacter infection, as the absence of furan is specifically linked to this type of infection. The context provides evidence of furan's role in identifying infectious causes, indicating a clear relationship.",
