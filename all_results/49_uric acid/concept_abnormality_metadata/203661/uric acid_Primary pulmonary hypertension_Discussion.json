    "context": "The finding that higher levels of NT-proBNP are associated with a poor prognosis in ILD patients also concurs with previous findings of BNP as a prognostic marker in ILD patients. 13 Troponin-T, uric acid, fibrin D-dimer and exhaled NO Troponin-T may reflect myocardial injury caused by right ventricular failure and was found to be related to a worse prognosis in patients with precapillary PH. 14,15 In accordance, in the present study, an association between higher levels of troponin-T and increased mortality was observed in ILD patients. Furthermore, patients with PH had higher troponin-T levels than non-PH patients, a difference that may be ascribed to right ventricular dilatation. In a study in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), a notably larger proportion of iPAH patients had abnormal uric acid values 16 than observed in the present study. This incongruence is probably explained by higher MPAPs and more severe affection of the nucleic acid metabolisation in iPAH patients. However, it appears from the present study that abnormal levels of uric acid in ILD patients are associated with both the presence of PH and a higher mortality. In iPAH, fibrin D-dimer is elevated.

        "summary": "In this context, uric acid is associated with primary pulmonary hypertension (PH) as abnormal levels of uric acid in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients correlate with the presence of PH and increased mortality. The study indicates that higher uric acid levels may reflect underlying metabolic disturbances related to PH, particularly in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), suggesting a significant relationship between uric acid levels and the severity of pulmonary hypertension.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between uric acid and primary pulmonary hypertension, supported by evidence of abnormal uric acid levels correlating with PH presence and mortality in ILD patients. This indicates a significant relationship, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.",
