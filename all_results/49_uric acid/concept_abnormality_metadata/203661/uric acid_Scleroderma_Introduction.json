    "context": "Echocardiography is a widely used screening tool, but may not, however, be readily available to pulmonologists. Therefore biomarkers as first line screening tools are warranted. A number of biomarkers for PH have been proposed, including NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin-T of which detectable levels are related to higher mortality in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 4 Furthermore, elevated levels of fibrin D-dimer and uric acid have been demonstrated in PAH, 4 while lower levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) have been associated with ILD and PH in scleroderma patients. 5 The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value for PH and the prognostic significance of the above mentioned biomarkers in ILD patients. Methods The present study is an analysis of a previously described cohort of 212 patients enrolled in a cross-sectional study at a tertiary referral centre for diagnosis and evaluation of ILD. 1 Briefly, the study was approved by The Danish Research Ethics Committee, Region Central Jutland (Issue nr: M-20080219) and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All patients with a diagnosis of ILD at the centre were eligible, and participants had echocardiography performed for the purpose of the study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, uric acid is mentioned as a biomarker that may be elevated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which can occur in individuals with scleroderma. While the study focuses on the diagnostic value of various biomarkers in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients, the connection between elevated uric acid levels and scleroderma is implied through its association with PAH. However, there is no direct discussion of uric acid's role specifically in scleroderma itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as uric acid is linked to pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication in scleroderma patients. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and uric acid is not specifically highlighted as a significant marker for scleroderma in the context provided.",
