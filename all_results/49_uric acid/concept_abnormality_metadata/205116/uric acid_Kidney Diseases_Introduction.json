    "context": "Conclusions A value of NT-proBNP below 95\u00a0ng/l may be used as a rule-out test for PH in ILD, and abnormally high levels of uric acid should increase the suspicion of PH in ILD patients. Furthermore, NT-proBNP, troponin-T, uric acid and fibrin D-dimer have prognostic value in ILD patients, while exhaled levels of NO does not predict PH or mortality. Conflict of interest None. In contrast to chronic hyperuricemia, generally considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, hypertension and metabolic syndrome, acute increase of plasma uric acid (UA) may induce various beneficial effects to human subjects. Administration of UA increases plasma antioxidant capacity, reduces exercise associated oxidative stress in healthy subjects and restores endothelial function in patients with type 1 diabetes and regular smokers. UA, as the most abundant aqueous antioxidant, accounting for up to 60% of plasma antioxidative capacity, may involve different mechanisms of action. It is a free radical scavenger which stabilizes vitamin C in serum, mostly due to its iron chelating properties, and quenches peroxynitrite, a potentially harmful oxidant, resulting in formation of a stable nitric oxide (NO) donor in vitro.

        "summary": "In this context, uric acid is discussed in relation to its prognostic value in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and its association with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Chronic hyperuricemia is noted as a risk factor for renal disease, indicating a significant relationship between elevated uric acid levels and kidney health. The text also contrasts acute increases in uric acid, which may have beneficial effects, with chronic conditions that pose risks to kidney function, highlighting the dual role of uric acid in health and disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between uric acid and kidney diseases, as chronic hyperuricemia is identified as a risk factor for renal disease. The context provides insights into the implications of uric acid levels on kidney health, supported by its prognostic value in ILD patients.",
