    "context": "Conclusions A value of NT-proBNP below 95\u00a0ng/l may be used as a rule-out test for PH in ILD, and abnormally high levels of uric acid should increase the suspicion of PH in ILD patients. Furthermore, NT-proBNP, troponin-T, uric acid and fibrin D-dimer have prognostic value in ILD patients, while exhaled levels of NO does not predict PH or mortality. Conflict of interest None. In contrast to chronic hyperuricemia, generally considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease, hypertension and metabolic syndrome, acute increase of plasma uric acid (UA) may induce various beneficial effects to human subjects. Administration of UA increases plasma antioxidant capacity, reduces exercise associated oxidative stress in healthy subjects and restores endothelial function in patients with type 1 diabetes and regular smokers. UA, as the most abundant aqueous antioxidant, accounting for up to 60% of plasma antioxidative capacity, may involve different mechanisms of action. It is a free radical scavenger which stabilizes vitamin C in serum, mostly due to its iron chelating properties, and quenches peroxynitrite, a potentially harmful oxidant, resulting in formation of a stable nitric oxide (NO) donor in vitro.

        "summary": "In this context, uric acid is discussed in relation to pulmonary hypertension (PH) in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients, where abnormally high levels of uric acid may indicate increased suspicion of PH. Chronic hyperuricemia is noted as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, while acute increases in uric acid can have beneficial effects, such as enhancing antioxidant capacity and restoring endothelial function. This dual role highlights the complex relationship between uric acid levels and hypertensive disease.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between uric acid and hypertensive disease, supported by evidence that high uric acid levels can indicate increased risk for hypertension and cardiovascular issues. The context also discusses both the detrimental and beneficial effects of uric acid, emphasizing its relevance.",
        "score": 4
