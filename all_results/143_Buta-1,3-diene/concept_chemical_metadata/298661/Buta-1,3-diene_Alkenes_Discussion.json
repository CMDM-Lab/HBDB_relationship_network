    "context": "Propylene does not have an AMCV because it is a simple asphyxiant. Annual average air concentration trends from 2002 to 2012 for nine monitoring sites were not significantly different, whereas for three monitoring sites increasing trends were noted (i.e., 1,3-butadiene at Groves, isoprene at Longview, and propylene at HRM 8). The toxicological significance of these increasing concentrations was minimal since all measured concentrations were well below their relevant AMCVs. Eight monitoring sites had significant decreasing trends of a specific olefin: 1,3-butadiene at Milby Park and Channelview; ethylene at Laredo Bridge and Lynchburg Ferry; isoprene at Danciger; and propylene at Baytown, HRM #3 Haden Rd, and Groves. Most of the sites showing decreasing trends from 2002 to 2012 are located in the Houston\u2013Galveston\u2013Brazoria ozone nonattainment areas. 1,3-Butadiene, propylene, and ethylene have been identified as highly reactive VOCs (HRVOCs) in Harris County, while ethylene and propylene are identified as HRVOCs in Brazoria County. HRVOCs contribute to ground-level ozone formation in these areas. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is identified as a specific type of alkene, which is a category of hydrocarbons characterized by at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The mention of buta-1,3-diene alongside other alkenes like propylene and ethylene highlights its classification within the broader group of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to ground-level ozone formation. However, the relationship is primarily categorical without detailed discussion of specific interactions or properties.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as buta-1,3-diene is explicitly categorized as an alkene, indicating a clear relationship. However, the context does not delve into specific interactions or functional implications between buta-1,3-diene and alkenes beyond their classification.",
