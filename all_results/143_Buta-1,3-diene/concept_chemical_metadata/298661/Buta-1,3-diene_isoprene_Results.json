    "context": "Since there are no EI olefin data near this site, measured olefin concentrations at this site may be representative of mobile source emissions. The 10-year olefin averages (and the percent detected over the LOD) are as follows: ethylene 3.9ppbv (96\u2013100%); 1,3-butadiene 0.18ppbv (6.5\u201355%); isoprene 0.16ppbv (4.3\u201324%); and propylene 1.6ppbv (87\u2013100%).Top five reported emission sources for each evaluated olefin Table 2 shows the top five EI sites based on the EI data for each of the evaluated olefins as a percentage of the total olefin emissions across the state. While most of these facilities emit multiple olefins, they are not necessarily ranked in the top five for more than one olefin. However, a few facilities (denoted in bold) are ranked in the top five for more than one olefin (e.g., Equistar Chemicals LP, Channelview is a top emitter for both 1,3-butadiene and isoprene). This table identifies monitoring sites that are located within two miles of the property boundaries of the identified top emitters, which suggests that these facilities could contribute to measured concentrations at that monitor. For most of the top five EI sites, monitors are not located within a two mile radius of the facility property boundary, or if they are, they may be located upwind of the facility. However, the following monitoring sites reported higher annual average concentrations for olefins (Table 1) and are located within two miles of the top five EI sites: Groves (ranked #2 for 1,3-butadiene and #5 for propylene); Channelview (ranked #5 for 1,3-butadiene); HRM 7 (ranked #1 for propylene); HRM 8 (ranked #3 for propylene); and Baytown (ranked # 2 for both propylene and ethylene).

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as olefins with reported concentrations from mobile source emissions. They are part of a broader analysis of emissions from various facilities, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the study of air quality and pollution. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed, as they are simply listed among other olefins without further discussion of their chemical or biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Buta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both olefins measured in the same study. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other beyond their presence in the emission data.",
        "score": 2
