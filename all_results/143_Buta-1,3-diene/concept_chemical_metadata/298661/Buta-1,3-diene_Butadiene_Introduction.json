    "context": "With a state that covers a large area, in order to better provide services to the citizens and regulated community, the TCEQ has broken down the state into four regional areas, which are further broken down into 16 individual regions. The monitoring sites that the TCEQ oversees are located within these regions; these monitors include stationary monitors that belong to various entities (state, local governments, councils of governments, and industry-sponsored). There are two primary types of stationary ambient air monitors that measure VOCs in the state: canister samplers that collect twenty-four-hour samples every sixth-day, and Automated Gas Chromatography (AutoGC) samplers that collect 40min samples every hour (referred to as a one-hour sample). It should be emphasized that monitors only provide a snapshot in time of ambient air concentrations at their respective locations.Spatial and temporal trends of the identified lower olefins The purpose of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of the identified lower olefins (1,3-butadiene, ethylene, isoprene, and propylene) across the state of Texas for 2002 through 2012. Chloroprene was not included in this analysis since there are no available monitoring data. The five monitoring sites measuring the highest concentrations in 2012 for each olefin were identified (hereafter referred to as the top five monitoring sites). Trend data of annual average ambient air concentrations for each olefin from 2002 to 2012 for the top five monitoring sites are presented. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned as part of a study evaluating the spatial and temporal trends of lower olefins, including 1,3-butadiene, across Texas from 2002 to 2012. Buta-1,3-diene is essentially another name for 1,3-butadiene, indicating that they refer to the same chemical compound. However, the context does not elaborate on their specific relationship beyond this identification.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are essentially the same compound. The context indicates their inclusion in a study of ambient air concentrations, providing a clear relationship, but lacks detailed discussion on their implications or differences.",
        "score": 4
