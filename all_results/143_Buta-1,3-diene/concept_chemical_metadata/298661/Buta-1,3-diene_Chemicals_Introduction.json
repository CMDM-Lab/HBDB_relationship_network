    "context": "Transparency document Industrial use of the lower olefins in Texas Texas industries include some of the major emitters of 1,3-butadiene, ethylene, isoprene, and propylene in the nation. Based on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) 2012 Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data, the total reported industrial air emissions in Texas for these olefins, as compared to total national reported air emissions, were 79% for 1,3-butadiene, 62% for ethylene, 76% for isoprene, and 54% for propylene. 1,3-Butadiene is used as an intermediate to produce a variety of industrial chemicals (e.g., polymers, elastomers), but its major uses are in the manufacturing of styrene-butadiene rubber, or synthetic rubber, and thermoplastic resins. The primary way 1,3-butadiene is released into the environment is from emissions from gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles and equipment. Ethylene is produced through both anthropogenic and natural activities. It is a high-production-volume chemical product of the petrochemical industry, and is primarily used as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals. ",
