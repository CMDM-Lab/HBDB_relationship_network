    "context": "However, a few facilities (denoted in bold) are ranked in the top five for more than one olefin (e.g., Equistar Chemicals LP, Channelview is a top emitter for both 1,3-butadiene and isoprene). This table identifies monitoring sites that are located within two miles of the property boundaries of the identified top emitters, which suggests that these facilities could contribute to measured concentrations at that monitor. For most of the top five EI sites, monitors are not located within a two mile radius of the facility property boundary, or if they are, they may be located upwind of the facility. However, the following monitoring sites reported higher annual average concentrations for olefins (Table 1) and are located within two miles of the top five EI sites: Groves (ranked #2 for 1,3-butadiene and #5 for propylene); Channelview (ranked #5 for 1,3-butadiene); HRM 7 (ranked #1 for propylene); HRM 8 (ranked #3 for propylene); and Baytown (ranked # 2 for both propylene and ethylene). Olefin monitoring data Although Texas industries are some of the major emitters of lower olefins in the nation, measured ambient air concentrations across the state for these olefins are in the low ppbv range. Measured concentrations were well below health-based AMCVs for 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, and were well below vegetation- and health-based AMCVs for ethylene. Propylene does not have an AMCV because it is a simple asphyxiant. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a significant olefin emitted by various facilities. The mention of both terms highlights the monitoring of emissions from facilities that are top emitters of this compound, indicating their relevance in environmental monitoring and air quality assessments. However, the context does not elaborate on any distinct differences or specific interactions between the two terms beyond their identification as the same substance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong relevance between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are essentially the same compound discussed in the context of emissions monitoring. The context provides evidence of their significance in environmental assessments, but does not delve into any unique characteristics or interactions.",
