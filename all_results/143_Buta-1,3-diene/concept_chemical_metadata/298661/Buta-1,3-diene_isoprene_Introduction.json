    "context": "With a state that covers a large area, in order to better provide services to the citizens and regulated community, the TCEQ has broken down the state into four regional areas, which are further broken down into 16 individual regions. The monitoring sites that the TCEQ oversees are located within these regions; these monitors include stationary monitors that belong to various entities (state, local governments, councils of governments, and industry-sponsored). There are two primary types of stationary ambient air monitors that measure VOCs in the state: canister samplers that collect twenty-four-hour samples every sixth-day, and Automated Gas Chromatography (AutoGC) samplers that collect 40min samples every hour (referred to as a one-hour sample). It should be emphasized that monitors only provide a snapshot in time of ambient air concentrations at their respective locations.Spatial and temporal trends of the identified lower olefins The purpose of this study was to evaluate the spatial and temporal trends of the identified lower olefins (1,3-butadiene, ethylene, isoprene, and propylene) across the state of Texas for 2002 through 2012. Chloroprene was not included in this analysis since there are no available monitoring data. The five monitoring sites measuring the highest concentrations in 2012 for each olefin were identified (hereafter referred to as the top five monitoring sites). Trend data of annual average ambient air concentrations for each olefin from 2002 to 2012 for the top five monitoring sites are presented. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both identified as lower olefins monitored for their ambient air concentrations across Texas from 2002 to 2012. The study evaluates the spatial and temporal trends of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs), indicating that they are part of a broader analysis of air quality and pollution trends. However, there is no specific discussion of their chemical interactions or biological implications within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between buta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as they are both categorized as lower olefins monitored in the same study. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or evidence of interaction, limiting the relevance.",
        "score": 2
