    "context": "In 2012, annual average concentrations at Milby Park were 0.62ppbv (this average is from AutoGC data as the canister sampler was deactivated in 2005, at which time an AutoGC was activated). The TCEQ established the Air Pollutant Watch List (APWL) for areas of the state where air toxics are persistently monitored at elevated concentrations as discussed in. Listing and delisting procedures for APWL sites are outlined in the APWL Protocol. Efforts to reduce emissions in APWL areas have contributed to decreases in 1,3-butadiene annual average concentrations in the Milby Park area; this area was removed from the APWL in 2009. It should be noted that personal exposure to olefins or other air toxics cannot be assessed based on the use of ambient air concentrations. A monitor measures a snapshot in time, so these ambient air measurements are not likely to be representative of an individual\u2019s exposure to air toxics. There are several considerations that should be taken into account when attempting to determine personal exposure, including the significant amount of time spent indoors, at home, at work, at school, in the car, and other locations.Olefin emissions data Estimated EI data for 2012 for Texas were lower when compared to 2002 EI data for all olefins.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound (VOC) monitored for air quality due to its toxicological significance. The discussion focuses on the monitoring and reduction of 1,3-butadiene concentrations in the Milby Park area, indicating a direct relationship between the two terms as they represent the same substance in environmental studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are two names for the same chemical compound. The context emphasizes the monitoring and reduction of this compound's concentrations, highlighting its relevance in air quality and public health.",
