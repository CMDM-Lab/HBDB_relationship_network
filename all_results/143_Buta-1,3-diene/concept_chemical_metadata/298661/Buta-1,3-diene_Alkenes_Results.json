    "context": "However, a few facilities (denoted in bold) are ranked in the top five for more than one olefin (e.g., Equistar Chemicals LP, Channelview is a top emitter for both 1,3-butadiene and isoprene). This table identifies monitoring sites that are located within two miles of the property boundaries of the identified top emitters, which suggests that these facilities could contribute to measured concentrations at that monitor. For most of the top five EI sites, monitors are not located within a two mile radius of the facility property boundary, or if they are, they may be located upwind of the facility. However, the following monitoring sites reported higher annual average concentrations for olefins (Table 1) and are located within two miles of the top five EI sites: Groves (ranked #2 for 1,3-butadiene and #5 for propylene); Channelview (ranked #5 for 1,3-butadiene); HRM 7 (ranked #1 for propylene); HRM 8 (ranked #3 for propylene); and Baytown (ranked # 2 for both propylene and ethylene). Olefin monitoring data Although Texas industries are some of the major emitters of lower olefins in the nation, measured ambient air concentrations across the state for these olefins are in the low ppbv range. Measured concentrations were well below health-based AMCVs for 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, and were well below vegetation- and health-based AMCVs for ethylene. Propylene does not have an AMCV because it is a simple asphyxiant. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is identified as a specific type of olefin, which is a category of alkenes. The text discusses emissions from facilities that produce various olefins, including Buta-1,3-diene, indicating that it is part of the broader class of alkenes. However, the relationship is primarily categorical, with no detailed interaction or specific functional relevance provided between Buta-1,3-diene and alkenes beyond their classification.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Buta-1,3-diene is a specific example of an alkene. While they share a general category, the context does not elaborate on their relationship or interactions.",
