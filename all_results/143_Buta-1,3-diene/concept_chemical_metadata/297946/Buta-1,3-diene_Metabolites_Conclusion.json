    "context": "These results suggests that PAH metabolites cannot be used as unequivocal biomarkers of airborne ETS and PAH exposures. Our study also presents novel data showing significant relationships between urinary excretion of the nicotine metabolites, cotinine and trans-3\u2032-hydroxycotinine and the gas-phase ETS marker, 3-ethenylpyridine. This serves to confirm the value of 3-ethenylpyridine as a chemical marker of ETS exposure which can be used in studies where it is not practicable to take urine samples. Furthermore we demonstrate significant associations between the urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and personal airborne exposures to 1,3-butadiene and benzo(a)pyrene, which IARC classifies as a known human carcinogen. In the context of the measured exposures, it appears that ETS is an important source of 1,3-butadiene and benzo(a)pyrene exposure. In the case of the other higher molecular weight PAH (benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, we found significant correlations between the atmospheric exposures to these compounds and the concentrations of urinary nicotine metabolites. Correlations of the sum of the medium molecular weight PAH (fluoranthene to chrysene) and of the sum of high molecular weight PAH (benzo(b)fluoranthene to coronene) with cotinine and trans-3\u2032-hydroxycotinine were statistically significant.

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a compound associated with personal airborne exposures, particularly in relation to nicotine metabolites such as cotinine and trans-3\u2032-hydroxycotinine. The study indicates significant correlations between urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and airborne exposures to buta-1,3-diene, suggesting that metabolites can reflect exposure levels to this compound. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the correlation rather than a detailed metabolic pathway or mechanism.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as buta-1,3-diene is linked to nicotine metabolites through exposure correlations, indicating some interaction in the context of environmental exposure studies, but lacking detailed metabolic insights.",
        "score": 3
