    "context": "The study sought to lead to advances in understanding the causes and magnitude of exposures to VOC and PAH (Delgado-Saborit et al., 2009a; Harrison et al., 2009) and to establish whether collecting lifestyle information is sufficient to model personal exposures reliably when compared with exposures evaluated independently by personal samplers (Delgado-Saborit et al., 2009b). The hypothesis tested in the work described in this paper is that urinary metabolites of PAH and ETS are excreted as a consequence of inhalation exposures to PAH and ETS-related VOCs (e.g. 3-EP), and that subjects exposed to higher concentrations of PAH and ETS-related VOCs will excrete higher levels of PAH and ETS metabolites. If the hypothesis is valid, then ETS and PAH metabolites might prove useful as biomarkers of inhalation exposure to carcinogenic VOCs and PAHs, such as 1,3-butadiene and benzo(a)pyrene, and therefore provide an alternative to costly personal exposure assessment measurements. The second hypothesis tested in this work is that 3-ethenylpyridine may serve as an ETS tracer in environmental samples, which might be useful in those situations where urinary ETS biomarkers (e.g. cotinine) cannot be collected. Recruitment of subjects The MATCH Project, recruited 100 healthy adult volunteer subjects for personal exposure and indoor microenvironment (home and office) measurements. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a carcinogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) whose urinary metabolites may serve as biomarkers for exposure assessment. The study hypothesizes that individuals exposed to higher concentrations of buta-1,3-diene will excrete higher levels of its metabolites, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its metabolic byproducts. This suggests that monitoring these metabolites could provide a reliable alternative to direct exposure measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between buta-1,3-diene and its metabolites, supported by the hypothesis that higher exposure leads to increased metabolite excretion, indicating a clear relationship in the context of exposure assessment.",
        "score": 4
