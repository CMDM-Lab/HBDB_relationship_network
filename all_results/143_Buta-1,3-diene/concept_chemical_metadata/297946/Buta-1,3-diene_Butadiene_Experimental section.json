    "context": "The sum of the first 16 PAH was also calculated adding the concentrations from Naph to B(ghi)P (Sum16PAH). These newly calculated values were considered as independent variables in the data analysis. Personal exposures and microenvironment concentrations were tested for normality using the skewness statistic. All the VOC concentrations, including 1,3-butadiene, PAH and urinary biomarker (ETS and PAH metabolites) concentrations were found to have right-skewed distributions. For this reason geometric means and geometric standard deviations are reported and all the environmental and biological concentrations were logged (log10). The datasets were normally distributed after log transformation. Measures of the association between PAH and VOC in environmental samples and ETS and PAH metabolites in biological samples were characterised by Pearson correlation coefficients (R) for logged data.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are likely referring to the same compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound (VOC) included in the analysis of personal exposures and environmental concentrations. The mention of both terms suggests a focus on the same chemical entity, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or differences in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are essentially the same compound, but the context does not elaborate on their relationship or any distinct properties.",
