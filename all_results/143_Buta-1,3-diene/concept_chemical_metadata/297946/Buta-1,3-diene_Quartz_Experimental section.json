    "context": "Volunteers were asked to complete a screening questionnaire containing information about personal lifestyle, the study key factors and the exclusion criteria. The subjects finally selected were briefed in the use of the equipment and form filling one week prior to the sampling week. Ethics Committee approval was secured for this study from the South Birmingham Research Ethics Committee, Birmingham (REC Ref No. 04/Q2707/152).Environmental monitoring and analysis 2.2.1 Personal exposure sampling Collection of the samples was spread over two years, from May 2005 to May 2007, 44% of the subjects were sampled during warm months (April\u2013September) and 56% in cold months (October\u2013March). Each subject was sampled for a group of 14 VOCs and 1,3-butadiene (separately) for a total of five consecutive 24-h periods using one personal sampler pump (SKC model PCXR8), connected to two different sorbent tubes (one for 14 VOCs and the other for 1,3-butadiene), and during one concurrent day an additional pump sampled PAH on 47-mm quartz filters. The active-sampling setup was enclosed in a small aluminum briefcase and additional power was supplied via camcorder batteries connected to the pumps. The flow rates used were 40mLmin\u22121 for VOC, 30mLmin\u22121 for 1,3-butadiene and 3Lmin\u22121 for PAH (Delgado-Saborit et al., 2009a). All collected samples were kept in refrigerated conditions after sampling and prior to analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and quartz are mentioned in relation to environmental monitoring and personal exposure sampling. Buta-1,3-diene is sampled separately as a volatile organic compound (VOC), while quartz filters are used to collect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between buta-1,3-diene and quartz, as they are part of different sampling processes without any indication of how they may influence each other or relate chemically or biologically.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as buta-1,3-diene and quartz are mentioned in the same context but without any direct relevance or interaction between them. They are simply part of separate sampling methodologies.",
