    "context": "The sum of the first 16 PAH was also calculated adding the concentrations from Naph to B(ghi)P (Sum16PAH). These newly calculated values were considered as independent variables in the data analysis. Personal exposures and microenvironment concentrations were tested for normality using the skewness statistic. All the VOC concentrations, including 1,3-butadiene, PAH and urinary biomarker (ETS and PAH metabolites) concentrations were found to have right-skewed distributions. For this reason geometric means and geometric standard deviations are reported and all the environmental and biological concentrations were logged (log10). The datasets were normally distributed after log transformation. Measures of the association between PAH and VOC in environmental samples and ETS and PAH metabolites in biological samples were characterised by Pearson correlation coefficients (R) for logged data.

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) whose concentrations were analyzed alongside other pollutants and their metabolites. The study focuses on the relationship between environmental concentrations of PAHs and VOCs, and the urinary biomarkers of exposure, including metabolites of buta-1,3-diene. However, the specific interactions or effects of buta-1,3-diene on its metabolites are not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as buta-1,3-diene is included in the analysis of VOCs and their metabolites, indicating a connection in the context of exposure assessment. However, the lack of detailed discussion on their specific interactions limits the strength of their relationship.",
