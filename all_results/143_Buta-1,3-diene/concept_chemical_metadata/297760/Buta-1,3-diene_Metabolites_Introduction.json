    "context": "Mercapturic acids are N-acetyl-l-cysteine-S-conjugates that are formed in the human body via the glutathione pathway through metabolism of a range of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. VOCs and/or their metabolites can react with glutathione (GSH) to form mercapturic acids. These metabolites are then removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. In the present study we monitor VOC metabolites as biomarkers of exposure to acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1-bromopropane, 1,3-butadiene, carbon disulfide, crotonaldehyde, cyanide, N-N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, vinyl chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, trichloroethylene, and xylene (Table 1 ). Except for 1-bromopropane, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene all the other parent compounds are constituents of tobacco smoke. 1-bromopropane, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene are widely used solvents that may be neurotoxic or carcinogenic. Although biological exposure limits have been established for occupationally exposed workers for some of the urinary VOC metabolites, there are no large scale data sets or reference levels for VOC metabolites available for the general U.S. population.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose metabolites are monitored as biomarkers of exposure. The metabolites of Buta-1,3-diene, like other VOCs, are formed through metabolic processes involving glutathione and are subsequently excreted in urine. This indicates a direct relationship where Buta-1,3-diene is metabolized into specific compounds that can be tracked for exposure assessment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Buta-1,3-diene and its metabolites, as the context discusses the metabolic pathway leading to the formation of these metabolites and their role as biomarkers for exposure. However, it lacks detailed quantitative data on the specific metabolites of Buta-1,3-diene.",
