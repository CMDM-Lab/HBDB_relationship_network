    "context": "Mercapturic acids are N-acetyl-l-cysteine-S-conjugates that are formed in the human body via the glutathione pathway through metabolism of a range of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. VOCs and/or their metabolites can react with glutathione (GSH) to form mercapturic acids. These metabolites are then removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. In the present study we monitor VOC metabolites as biomarkers of exposure to acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1-bromopropane, 1,3-butadiene, carbon disulfide, crotonaldehyde, cyanide, N-N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, vinyl chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, trichloroethylene, and xylene (Table 1 ). Except for 1-bromopropane, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene all the other parent compounds are constituents of tobacco smoke. 1-bromopropane, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene are widely used solvents that may be neurotoxic or carcinogenic. Although biological exposure limits have been established for occupationally exposed workers for some of the urinary VOC metabolites, there are no large scale data sets or reference levels for VOC metabolites available for the general U.S. population.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and cyanides are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be metabolized in the human body, leading to the formation of mercapturic acids via the glutathione pathway. However, the relationship between these two specific compounds is not directly discussed, and they are listed among various other VOCs monitored for exposure, indicating a general association rather than a specific interaction or functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Buta-1,3-diene and cyanides are part of a broader discussion on VOCs and their metabolites, but there is no detailed exploration of their specific relationship or interactions.",
        "score": 2
