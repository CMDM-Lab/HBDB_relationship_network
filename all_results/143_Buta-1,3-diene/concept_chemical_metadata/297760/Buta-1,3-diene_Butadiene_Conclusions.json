    "context": "Acrolein, which is a major cigarette-related lung cancer agent can also be formed within the physiological metabolism of fatty acids in the human body. As dietary and smoking habits, work exposure and endogenous factors contribute to biomonitoring results, these factors should be considered when interpreting VOC metabolite data. We developed a selective, precise and sensitive method that uses UPLC/ESI-MSMS to measure 28 urinary biomarkers of exposure to 19 different VOC parent compounds. Importantly this method distinguishes smokers from non-smokers based on measured levels of metabolites of acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon-disulfide, crotonaldehyde, N, N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, propylene oxide, styrene, and xylenes. By improving exposure assessment for these hazardous VOCs, this method can serve as a valuable tool to improve studies related to VOC exposure and health effects such as cancer, birth defects, and neurocognitive impairment. This high throughput method will be applied to samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate baseline urinary VOC metabolite levels and to determine VOC exposure among the U.S. population. [1] Subcycle strong-field ionization (SFI) underlies many emerging spectroscopic probes of atomic or molecular attosecond electronic dynamics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are likely referring to the same compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with health risks such as cancer. The context discusses a method for measuring urinary biomarkers of exposure to various VOCs, including butadiene, indicating its relevance in studies of exposure and health effects. However, the terms are not explicitly linked in a detailed manner beyond their identification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both terms refer to the same compound and are included in a discussion about VOC exposure and health effects. However, there is no detailed exploration of their relationship beyond this identification.",
