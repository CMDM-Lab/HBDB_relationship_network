    "context": "As expected we found significant correlations (measured by Spearman correlation) between DHBMA and MHBMA3 (r =0.63, p <0.0001); AAMA and GAMA (r =0.75, p <0.0001); and CEMA and HPMA (r =0.79, p <0.0001) among smokers. Some of the VOC metabolites are non-specific and can be formed through the metabolism of dietary sources; others are endogenous. AMCC may be formed from the dietary uptake of methyl isothiocyanate which is a component of wine and cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, turnips and cress. DHBMA may be formed from endogenous butadiene-diol. Acrolein, which is a major cigarette-related lung cancer agent can also be formed within the physiological metabolism of fatty acids in the human body. As dietary and smoking habits, work exposure and endogenous factors contribute to biomonitoring results, these factors should be considered when interpreting VOC metabolite data. We developed a selective, precise and sensitive method that uses UPLC/ESI-MSMS to measure 28 urinary biomarkers of exposure to 19 different VOC parent compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a precursor for the formation of certain metabolites, including DHBMA, which may be derived from its physiological metabolism. Glycol is not directly discussed in relation to Buta-1,3-diene, but both terms are part of a broader discussion on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their metabolites. The relationship is not explicitly defined, indicating a general connection through metabolic pathways rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Buta-1,3-diene and Glycol, as they are both involved in the context of VOC metabolism. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
