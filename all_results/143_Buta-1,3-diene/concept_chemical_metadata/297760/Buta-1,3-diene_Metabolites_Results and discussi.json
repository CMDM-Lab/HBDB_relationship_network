    "context": "Among MHBMA isomers, MHBMA3 (N-acetyl-S-(4-hydroxy-2-buten-1-yl)-l-cysteine) was detected in majority of the samples (99%) tested (Fig. 3 ), while MHBMA1 was not. Analysis of fresh urine in this study indicated that the MHBMA3 measured was not an artifact of storage or acidification as discussed in previous studies. Selective chromatography also resolved 2HPMA (propylene oxide biomarker) from 3HPMA (acrolein biomarker), and also resolved trichloroethylene biomarkers 1,2DCVMA and 2,2DCVMA. We monitored three sets of mercapturic acid metabolites that are biomarkers of the same parent VOCs: DHBMA and MHBMA metabolites of 1,3-butadiene; AAMA and GAMA metabolites of acrylamide; and CEMA and HPMA metabolites of acrolein. Because these pairs of metabolites are formed from the same parent compounds, it is highly probable that both analytes in each pair are correlated. As expected we found significant correlations (measured by Spearman correlation) between DHBMA and MHBMA3 (r =0.63, p <0.0001); AAMA and GAMA (r =0.75, p <0.0001); and CEMA and HPMA (r =0.79, p <0.0001) among smokers. Some of the VOC metabolites are non-specific and can be formed through the metabolism of dietary sources; others are endogenous. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is directly related to its metabolites, specifically the mercapturic acid metabolites DHBMA and MHBMA, which serve as biomarkers for exposure to this volatile organic compound (VOC). The study highlights significant correlations between these metabolites, indicating that they are formed from the metabolism of Buta-1,3-diene. This relationship underscores the importance of monitoring these metabolites as indicators of exposure to the parent compound in biological samples, particularly in smokers.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between Buta-1,3-diene and its metabolites, supported by significant correlation data. The metabolites are specifically identified as biomarkers of Buta-1,3-diene exposure, indicating a clear and relevant relationship in the context of toxicology and exposure assessment.",
