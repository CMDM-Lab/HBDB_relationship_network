    "context": "Acrolein, which is a major cigarette-related lung cancer agent can also be formed within the physiological metabolism of fatty acids in the human body. As dietary and smoking habits, work exposure and endogenous factors contribute to biomonitoring results, these factors should be considered when interpreting VOC metabolite data. We developed a selective, precise and sensitive method that uses UPLC/ESI-MSMS to measure 28 urinary biomarkers of exposure to 19 different VOC parent compounds. Importantly this method distinguishes smokers from non-smokers based on measured levels of metabolites of acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon-disulfide, crotonaldehyde, N, N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, propylene oxide, styrene, and xylenes. By improving exposure assessment for these hazardous VOCs, this method can serve as a valuable tool to improve studies related to VOC exposure and health effects such as cancer, birth defects, and neurocognitive impairment. This high throughput method will be applied to samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate baseline urinary VOC metabolite levels and to determine VOC exposure among the U.S. population. [1] Subcycle strong-field ionization (SFI) underlies many emerging spectroscopic probes of atomic or molecular attosecond electronic dynamics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and propylene oxide are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be measured as urinary biomarkers of exposure. The method developed for assessing these compounds aims to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers based on their metabolite levels. However, the specific relationship or interaction between Buta-1,3-diene and propylene oxide is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association as part of a broader study on VOC exposure rather than a direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as both Buta-1,3-diene and propylene oxide are included in a list of VOCs analyzed for exposure assessment, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions within the context.",
