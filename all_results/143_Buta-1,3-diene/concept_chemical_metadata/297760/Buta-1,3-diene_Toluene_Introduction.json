    "context": "Mercapturic acids are N-acetyl-l-cysteine-S-conjugates that are formed in the human body via the glutathione pathway through metabolism of a range of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. VOCs and/or their metabolites can react with glutathione (GSH) to form mercapturic acids. These metabolites are then removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. In the present study we monitor VOC metabolites as biomarkers of exposure to acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1-bromopropane, 1,3-butadiene, carbon disulfide, crotonaldehyde, cyanide, N-N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, vinyl chloride, styrene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, trichloroethylene, and xylene (Table 1 ). Except for 1-bromopropane, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene all the other parent compounds are constituents of tobacco smoke. 1-bromopropane, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene are widely used solvents that may be neurotoxic or carcinogenic. Although biological exposure limits have been established for occupationally exposed workers for some of the urinary VOC metabolites, there are no large scale data sets or reference levels for VOC metabolites available for the general U.S. population.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be metabolized in the human body to form mercapturic acids via the glutathione pathway. They are included in a list of chemicals monitored for their metabolites as biomarkers of exposure, particularly in relation to tobacco smoke and occupational exposure. However, the context does not provide specific details on their direct interaction or comparative significance in biological processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both Buta-1,3-diene and toluene are categorized as VOCs and mentioned in the same context regarding their metabolism and biomarker monitoring. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
