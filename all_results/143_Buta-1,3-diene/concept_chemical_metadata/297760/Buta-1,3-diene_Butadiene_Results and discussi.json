    "context": "As expected we found significant correlations (measured by Spearman correlation) between DHBMA and MHBMA3 (r =0.63, p <0.0001); AAMA and GAMA (r =0.75, p <0.0001); and CEMA and HPMA (r =0.79, p <0.0001) among smokers. Some of the VOC metabolites are non-specific and can be formed through the metabolism of dietary sources; others are endogenous. AMCC may be formed from the dietary uptake of methyl isothiocyanate which is a component of wine and cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, turnips and cress. DHBMA may be formed from endogenous butadiene-diol. Acrolein, which is a major cigarette-related lung cancer agent can also be formed within the physiological metabolism of fatty acids in the human body. As dietary and smoking habits, work exposure and endogenous factors contribute to biomonitoring results, these factors should be considered when interpreting VOC metabolite data. We developed a selective, precise and sensitive method that uses UPLC/ESI-MSMS to measure 28 urinary biomarkers of exposure to 19 different VOC parent compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in metabolic processes. The mention of endogenous butadiene-diol suggests a metabolic pathway linking Butadiene to its derivatives, including Buta-1,3-diene. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific health implications directly connecting the two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in the context of VOC metabolism, indicating a relationship through metabolic pathways, but lacking detailed exploration of their specific interactions or health effects.",
