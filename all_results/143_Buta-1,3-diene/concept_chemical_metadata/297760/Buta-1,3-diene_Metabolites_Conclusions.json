    "context": "Acrolein, which is a major cigarette-related lung cancer agent can also be formed within the physiological metabolism of fatty acids in the human body. As dietary and smoking habits, work exposure and endogenous factors contribute to biomonitoring results, these factors should be considered when interpreting VOC metabolite data. We developed a selective, precise and sensitive method that uses UPLC/ESI-MSMS to measure 28 urinary biomarkers of exposure to 19 different VOC parent compounds. Importantly this method distinguishes smokers from non-smokers based on measured levels of metabolites of acrolein, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, carbon-disulfide, crotonaldehyde, N, N-dimethylformamide, ethylbenzene, propylene oxide, styrene, and xylenes. By improving exposure assessment for these hazardous VOCs, this method can serve as a valuable tool to improve studies related to VOC exposure and health effects such as cancer, birth defects, and neurocognitive impairment. This high throughput method will be applied to samples from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate baseline urinary VOC metabolite levels and to determine VOC exposure among the U.S. population. [1] Subcycle strong-field ionization (SFI) underlies many emerging spectroscopic probes of atomic or molecular attosecond electronic dynamics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for which urinary metabolites are measured to assess exposure levels. The developed method aims to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers based on the levels of metabolites from various VOCs, including Buta-1,3-diene. This indicates a direct relationship where the metabolites serve as biomarkers for exposure to Buta-1,3-diene, linking it to health effects such as cancer and other impairments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Buta-1,3-diene and its metabolites, as the context discusses the measurement of urinary metabolites specifically to assess exposure to Buta-1,3-diene and other VOCs, indicating a clear relationship supported by the methodology described.",
        "score": 4
