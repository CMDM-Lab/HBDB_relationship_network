    "context": "BD is also a common environmental air contaminant, and all potential subjects have had daily exposures because of contact with cigarette smoke, auto exhaust, and urban air pollution. In this context, the added potential risk to the subjects is small and of the same magnitude as daily exposures. It was estimated that the experimental exposure, 2 ppm for 20 min, would result in less than a one per million increase in lifetime risk of leukemia, using the California EPA, Air Resources Board risk assessment, which was based on the mouse as the most sensitive species. The butadiene exposure is approximately equal to ever having smoked one cigarette because cigarette smoke contains about 2 ppm BD, and it takes approximately 20 min to smoke one. Nearly all of the volunteers reported smoking or attending smokey clubs at some time in their lives, so this was not considered an unacceptable risk. Before accepting a volunteer, it was clearly stated verbally and in writing in the consent form that this exposure could increase their lifetime risk of leukemia. All subjects read and signed a consent form before being allowed to participate in the study. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are essentially the same compound, with Buta-1,3-diene being a systematic name for Butadiene. The discussion focuses on the environmental exposure to Butadiene (BD) as an air contaminant, particularly in relation to cigarette smoke and urban pollution, highlighting its potential health risks, including an increased lifetime risk of leukemia. The terms are used interchangeably, emphasizing their direct chemical relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a very strong relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene is the systematic name for Butadiene, indicating a direct and critical relationship between the two terms in the context of environmental exposure and health risks.",
        "score": 5
