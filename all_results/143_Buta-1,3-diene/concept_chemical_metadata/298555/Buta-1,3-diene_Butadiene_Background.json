    "context": "where the uptake fraction is defined as the ratio of the uptake to the total inhaled expressed as a percentage. The overall uptake per kilogram was approximately log normal, skewed to higher values, and there was a wide range across the population: 0.6\u20134.9 \u03bcg/kg. In multiple regression analyses, log10(uptake per kilogram) was a strong function of alveolar ventilation and blood\u2013air partition coefficient for butadiene. Lin and coworkers also observed that population variables, sex, age, and race, were also associated with statistically significant differences in uptake. When each population parameter was considered alone in univariate regression analyses with log10(uptake per kilogram), the only significant relationship was seen for cigarette smoking status (yes=1, no=0). However, when multivariate analyses were conducted, sex (females had 24% more uptake than males) and age (10% loss per decade of life) were both significant, in addition to cigarette smoking. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are likely referring to the same compound, as Buta-1,3-diene is a common name for 1,3-butadiene. The discussion focuses on the uptake of butadiene in the population, influenced by factors such as alveolar ventilation and blood\u2013air partition coefficient. However, the relationship between the two terms is not explicitly detailed beyond their chemical identity.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms refer to the same chemical compound, but the context does not elaborate on their relationship or specific interactions beyond nomenclature.",
