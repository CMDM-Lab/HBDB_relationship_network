    "context": "The total cigarette MS deliveries of 1,3-butadiene and acrolein are similar to the deliveries measured using the VOC GC/MS and carbonyl derivative HPLC methods, respectively. Human disease risk for an environmental contaminant is a function of exposure intensity. However, if the substance is metabolically activated and deactivated, which includes many chemical carcinogens, the risk does not depend on exposure intensity alone, but also depends on metabolism. 1,3-Butadiene (BD) is such a chemical. BD metabolism has a complex series of oxidation and reduction steps that has been reviewed in detail by Himmelstein and coworkers. In summary, BD is oxidized (activated) by P450 enzymes, including CYP2E1 (2E1) and CYP2A6 (2A6), to a series of toxic mono- and di-epoxide compounds, which are deactivated by epoxide hydrolase (EH) and glutathione-S-transferase enzymes (GST\u03bc, and GST\u03b8). Large differences have been observed in the rates of these activation and deactivation processes by in-vitro studies of rat, mouse and human tissues. ",
