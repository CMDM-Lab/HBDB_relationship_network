    "context": "In the above described European epidemiological study, it was observed that a higher exposure to NO2 increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. Because they have a more rapid rate of respiration and so inhale more pollutants per kilogram of body weight than adults, children are more susceptible to air pollution. Traffic exhaust is a major cause of children's exposure to air pollutants and several authors in the US as well as in Europe found a positive correlation between local traffic density at the time of diagnosis and childhood leukemias with an estimated relative risk between 1.6 and 4.7 [207\u2013210].Indoor air pollution Indoor air pollution is a growing scientific concern because indoor air can lead to a concentration of many carcinogenic pollutants. In addition to carbon particles and PAH, indoor air can accumulate ETS as well as chemicals such as biocides and formaldehyde in addition to volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, which have been rated as carcinogens by IARC. The risk of lung cancer due to ETS exposure is slightly higher at work than at home and higher for ex-smokers than for never smokers. Since children are the most affected by chronic household exposure, they may be at a higher risk of cancer. Particularly of concern is the association between parental and/or childhood exposure and the risk of childhood cancers and cancers in adulthood. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned as part of a discussion on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are considered carcinogenic, particularly in relation to lung cancer risk. However, the terms are used interchangeably without a detailed exploration of their specific relationship or differences. Both compounds are implicated in air pollution and its health effects, but the context does not provide a direct connection between them beyond their classification as harmful VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are categorized as VOCs associated with cancer risk, but their specific relationship or differences are not elaborated upon in the context.",
