    "context": "In the above described European epidemiological study, it was observed that a higher exposure to NO2 increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. Because they have a more rapid rate of respiration and so inhale more pollutants per kilogram of body weight than adults, children are more susceptible to air pollution. Traffic exhaust is a major cause of children's exposure to air pollutants and several authors in the US as well as in Europe found a positive correlation between local traffic density at the time of diagnosis and childhood leukemias with an estimated relative risk between 1.6 and 4.7 [207\u2013210].Indoor air pollution Indoor air pollution is a growing scientific concern because indoor air can lead to a concentration of many carcinogenic pollutants. In addition to carbon particles and PAH, indoor air can accumulate ETS as well as chemicals such as biocides and formaldehyde in addition to volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, which have been rated as carcinogens by IARC. The risk of lung cancer due to ETS exposure is slightly higher at work than at home and higher for ex-smokers than for never smokers. Since children are the most affected by chronic household exposure, they may be at a higher risk of cancer. Particularly of concern is the association between parental and/or childhood exposure and the risk of childhood cancers and cancers in adulthood. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to indoor air pollution, alongside carbon particles and other carcinogenic pollutants. Both Buta-1,3-diene and carbon are implicated in the risk of lung cancer, particularly in children exposed to air pollution. However, the relationship is more about their shared role as pollutants rather than a direct interaction or specific functional relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Buta-1,3-diene and carbon, as both are mentioned in the context of air pollution and cancer risk. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or a direct relationship.",
