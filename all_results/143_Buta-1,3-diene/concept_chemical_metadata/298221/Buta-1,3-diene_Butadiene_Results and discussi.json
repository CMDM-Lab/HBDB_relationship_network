    "context": "The main advantage of the GC/MS approach is that many more smoke constituents can be monitored simultaneously in one experiment than possible using TDL spectroscopy. In that study, cigarette filters were evaluated that contained less carbon than the experimental carbon filtered cigarettes discussed herein. In that GC/MS investigation reported in 2002, the acrolein and 1,3-butadiene per puff profiles showed no breakthrough, even after eight puffs were taken. The advantage of this TDL method is that breakthrough could be measured for both constituents using experimental cigarettes of similar construction but with significantly more carbon in the filter, resulting in a smoke having even less acrolein and 1,3-butadiene than the carbon filtered cigarettes used in the GC/MS evaluation. A dual TDL spectroscopy system was used successfully to measure 1,3-butadiene and acrolein in a single 35ml puff of MS cigarette smoke, with a limit of detection, calculated at 3\u03c3, of 4ng/puff and 24ng/puff, respectively. This detection limit is sufficient to determine breakthrough of propylene, acrolein, and 1,3-butadiene for prototype cigarette models with filters containing different carbon materials. Propylene was observed to track the breakthrough behavior of both acrolein and 1,3-butadiene for each carbon filtered cigarette model. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are essentially the same compound, with Buta-1,3-diene being an alternative name for 1,3-butadiene. The text discusses the measurement of 1,3-butadiene in cigarette smoke using GC/MS and TDL spectroscopy methods, indicating their relevance in the analysis of smoke constituents. The relationship is direct, as they refer to the same chemical entity involved in the study of smoke emissions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are two names for the same compound, which is central to the context of measuring smoke constituents.",
        "score": 5
