    "context": "Generally, two separate analytical methods are needed for determining 1,3-butadiene and acrolein deliveries in cigarette smoke, as referenced by Counts et al., that require different sample trapping, extraction, and/or derivatization techniques, chromatographic separation schemes and detection. Carbonyl-containing smoke constituent molecules such as acrolein, are derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and analyzed by HPLC. Due to the reactivity and thermal instability of some smoke constituents, derivatization can have limitations with selectivity and instability of reactive species due to the long reaction times required which often produce unstable derivatives. Deliveries of volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as 1,3-butadiene, are determined by collecting the smoke with an impinger trap in either ice water or dry ice/isopropanol, then analyzing a sample of the collected organics with a GC/MS. While the carbonyl method employs one cigarette per determination, the VOC method involves smoking ten cigarettes, collecting and measuring all of the smoke, then dividing the total deliveries by 10 to obtain a per cigarette value. Generally, carbon filtered cigarettes yield smoke having lower deliveries of acrolein and 1,3-butadiene, approaching the detection limits of the HPLC and GC/MS analytical methods. While the existing analytical methods discussed above are appropriate for comparing smoke deliveries among different cigarette brands, quantitative methods and smoke sampling systems are required that can measure constituents during each puff in order to obtain a better understanding of what is occurring during the formation of the smoke.
