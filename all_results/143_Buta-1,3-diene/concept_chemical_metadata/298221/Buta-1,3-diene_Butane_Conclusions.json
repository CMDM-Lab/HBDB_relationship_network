    "context": "The lighting puff delivery of 1,3-butadiene represents \u223c25% of the total 1,3-butadiene delivery for the 1R5F cigarettes. Acrolein does not show this behavior, suggesting different mechanisms for acrolein and 1,3-butadiene formation in MS cigarette smoke. All carbon-filtered cigarette models retained the higher 1,3-butadiene delivery in the lighting puff. The acrolein and 1,3-butadiene first puff deliveries were not affected by using either a yellow flame butane or electric lighter. The total cigarette MS deliveries of 1,3-butadiene and acrolein are similar to the deliveries measured using the VOC GC/MS and carbonyl derivative HPLC methods, respectively. Human disease risk for an environmental contaminant is a function of exposure intensity. However, if the substance is metabolically activated and deactivated, which includes many chemical carcinogens, the risk does not depend on exposure intensity alone, but also depends on metabolism.

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and butane are both mentioned in relation to cigarette smoke delivery mechanisms. While buta-1,3-diene is highlighted as a significant component of smoke, butane is referenced in the context of lighting methods for cigarettes. However, there is no direct interaction or metabolic relationship discussed between the two compounds, indicating a more incidental connection rather than a functional one.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as buta-1,3-diene and butane are connected through their mention in cigarette smoke but lack a detailed discussion of their interaction or significance in metabolism or toxicity.",
