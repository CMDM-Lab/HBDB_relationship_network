    "context": "The main advantage of the GC/MS approach is that many more smoke constituents can be monitored simultaneously in one experiment than possible using TDL spectroscopy. In that study, cigarette filters were evaluated that contained less carbon than the experimental carbon filtered cigarettes discussed herein. In that GC/MS investigation reported in 2002, the acrolein and 1,3-butadiene per puff profiles showed no breakthrough, even after eight puffs were taken. The advantage of this TDL method is that breakthrough could be measured for both constituents using experimental cigarettes of similar construction but with significantly more carbon in the filter, resulting in a smoke having even less acrolein and 1,3-butadiene than the carbon filtered cigarettes used in the GC/MS evaluation. A dual TDL spectroscopy system was used successfully to measure 1,3-butadiene and acrolein in a single 35ml puff of MS cigarette smoke, with a limit of detection, calculated at 3\u03c3, of 4ng/puff and 24ng/puff, respectively. This detection limit is sufficient to determine breakthrough of propylene, acrolein, and 1,3-butadiene for prototype cigarette models with filters containing different carbon materials. Propylene was observed to track the breakthrough behavior of both acrolein and 1,3-butadiene for each carbon filtered cigarette model. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and carbon are related through their roles in cigarette smoke filtration. The study discusses how different carbon materials in cigarette filters affect the levels of smoke constituents, including buta-1,3-diene. The presence of carbon in the filters is crucial for reducing the concentration of harmful compounds like buta-1,3-diene in the smoke, indicating a significant relationship between the two in the context of smoke analysis and filtration efficiency.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between buta-1,3-diene and carbon, as the study provides evidence of how carbon filters impact the levels of buta-1,3-diene in cigarette smoke, demonstrating a clear functional relationship.",
