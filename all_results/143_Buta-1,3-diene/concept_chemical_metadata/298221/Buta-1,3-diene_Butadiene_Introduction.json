    "context": "Furthermore, due to the small size of the aerosol particles in cigarette smoke (100\u2013400nm) compared to the wavelength of the infrared radiation in the region of interest (\u223c10,000nm), the IR laser light is not scattered by the aerosol particles. Finally, since the laser scans over such a small frequency range, larger molecules, which might absorb light in the same region, simply attenuate the beam due to unresolvable rotational structure and consequently do not adversely affect the measurement of the analyte of interest. The application of IR lead-salt TDL spectroscopy for the measurement of formaldehyde in single puffs of cigarette smoke was reported in 2000 using a small dead volume impaction device in place of a Cambridge filter pad since the pad retains \u223c30% formaldehyde during smoking. A more direct method of sampling cigarette smoke using our dual lead-salt TDL instrument has been reported, and this approach was applied to measure both acrolein and 1,3-butadiene in a single puff. Instrumentation The dual-channel TDL spectrometer system shown in the photograph in Fig. 1 has been described previously. It was designed and built for Philip Morris USA by Aerodyne Research, Inc. (ARI, Billerica, MA) for monitoring gaseous constituents in single puffs of MS cigarette smoke. A liquid nitrogen Dewar (IR Labs, Tucson, AZ) houses two lead-salt TDLs (Laser Components, Hudson, NH) and four mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detectors (Kolmar Technologies, Inc, Newbury, MA). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound found in cigarette smoke. The mention of Buta-1,3-diene likely serves as an alternative name for Butadiene, indicating their direct chemical identity. However, the context does not elaborate on their specific properties or implications beyond this identification.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are essentially the same compound. The context confirms their identity without ambiguity, establishing a strong relevance.",
        "score": 5
