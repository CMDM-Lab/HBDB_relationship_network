    "context": "The Kentucky Reference 1R5F and three different carbon filtered cigarette models were analyzed for deliveries of acrolein, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene, and propylene. The 1R5F reference cigarette (70% filter ventilation) was selected for analysis because the smoke contained low levels of acrolein and 1,3-butadiene, which was desirable to evaluate the precision of the TDL per puff method. The 1R5F was analyzed each day during testing to verify that the instrument was performing properly. Also, the 1R5F total MS cigarette delivery data obtained for acrolein and 1,3-butadiene using the TDL per puff method could be compared to the results from three other laboratories at Philip Morris USA which used the VOC GC/MS method for 1,3-butadiene and the carbonyl HPLC method for acrolein. The three models differed only in the type of carbon tested, labeled A, B, and C, and were designed with the same tobacco blends, \u223c48% filter ventilation, and 180mg of carbon inserted into an 8mm space in the cellulose acetate (CA) filter. Seven cigarettes with each type of carbon and eleven 1R5F cigarettes were analyzed. Prior to sampling, the cigarettes were conditioned for 24h in a conditioned laboratory at 72\u00b12\u00b0F (22\u00b11\u00b0C) and 60\u00b12% relative humidity. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to the analysis of cigarette smoke components. Specifically, 1,3-butadiene is a compound analyzed in the smoke of the 1R5F reference cigarette, which is a specific type of cigarette used for testing. The terms refer to the same chemical compound, with Buta-1,3-diene being an alternative name for Butadiene, indicating a direct chemical relationship rather than a functional or contextual one.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and highly relevant relationship, as Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are essentially the same compound, with the context discussing its presence in cigarette smoke analysis. This strong connection is critical in the study of harmful substances in tobacco products.",
