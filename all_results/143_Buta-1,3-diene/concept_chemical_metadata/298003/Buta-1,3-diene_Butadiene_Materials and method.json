    "context": "The confidence intervals of the standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated from the Poisson distribution.Risk estimate based on \u201cunit risk\u201d The estimates of contributions from refinery emissions in the two \u201cexposed parishes\u201d (see Section 3) were combined with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unit risk estimates for benzene, based on data from the Pliofilm cohort (US EPA 2000). Although ethylene (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), group 3) and propene (IARC group 3) are not proven human carcinogens, there are relatively strong suspicions that these compounds are carcinogenic to humans. This is based on the fact that they are partly metabolized to ethylene oxide and propene oxide, known carcinogens. 1,3-butadiene was recently classified as a group 1 carcinogen (Grosse et al., 2007). Risk estimates were therefore also calculated for these three olefins, based on published proposed unit risks (US EPA, 2002, Viktorin, 1998). Exposure assessment We compared the results of dispersion modelling with the estimated additional benzene concentrations at measurement site 1 (Fig. 1) during the two 2-month periods, in 2002 and in 2005. We concluded that the modelled contribution (1\u03bcg/m3) for these short periods was 2.5\u20135 times higher than the contribution actually measured (0.4 and 0.2\u03bcg/m3, see Section 2.2). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is classified as a group 1 carcinogen. The text discusses the carcinogenic risks associated with 1,3-butadiene exposure, particularly in relation to refinery emissions. The terms are used interchangeably, indicating a direct relationship as they represent the same chemical entity with significant health implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are the same compound with established carcinogenic risks. The context emphasizes the health implications of exposure to this chemical, reinforcing their strong relevance.",
        "score": 5
