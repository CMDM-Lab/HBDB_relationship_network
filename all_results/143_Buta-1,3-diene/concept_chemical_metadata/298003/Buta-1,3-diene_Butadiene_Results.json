    "context": "There were also three cases of acute lymphatic leukaemia, one case of chronic myeloid leukaemia, one case of unspecified myeloid leukaemia, three cases of myelofibrosis, two cases of polycythemia vera and one case of \u2018other\u2019 leukaemia. None of the 19 leukaemia cases occurring during 1995\u20132004 in parishes A and B had moved into the area in the observation period, consistent with few elderly people moving between communities in this area of Sweden. Post-hoc analyses showed that the increase in leukaemia was mainly driven by parish B, which has a population size two times that of parish A. Adding parish C (a sparsely populated parish) affected the risk estimate only marginally.Risk estimate using published exposure\u2013response relationships Based on the population size (5000) and the US EPA \u201cunit risk\u201d (US EPA, 2000), the estimated additional contribution of benzene would theoretically cause only 0.03 extra cases of death from leukaemia in the two exposed parishes in a 30-year period. Adding risk estimated for ethylene, 1,3-butadiene and propene resulted in an estimated 0.15 extra cases, approximately, in 30 years. As will be discussed below, the US EPA \u201cunit risk\u201d may, however, underestimate leukaemia risk at low-level benzene exposure. The present study shows an increased incidence of leukaemia in a small area downwind of an oil refinery emitting benzene and olefins. This was unexpected since exposure estimates indicated very small elevations of these VOCs above background, and, according to commonly used risk estimates, the excess risk at these low exposure levels should not be detectable in an epidemiological study.Internal validity issues The Swedish cancer registry is of good quality (Mattsson et al., 1985).This is true also for the census data providing the age and sex distribution of the parishes we examined.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are likely referring to the same compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with increased leukemia risk. The study discusses the epidemiological findings related to leukemia cases in areas exposed to emissions from an oil refinery, including butadiene exposure. However, the specific relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene is not elaborated upon, suggesting they are used interchangeably without distinct discussion.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both terms refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is implicated in the study's findings on leukemia risk. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or distinctions between the two terms.",
