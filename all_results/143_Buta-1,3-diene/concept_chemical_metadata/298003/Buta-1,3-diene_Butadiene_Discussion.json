    "context": "However, since the long-term prognosis of leukaemia was relatively poor at the time of the Pliofilm study, the leukaemia incidence should not have been very much higher. Today more leukaemia cases are cured. The studies of Australian (Glass et al., 2003) and Swedish (J\u00e4rvholm et al., 1997) oil refinery workers were based on incidence data. For ethylene, 1,3-butadiene and propene, the risk estimates are even more uncertain, given that risk estimates are based on the metabolism of these olefins to the carcinogens ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (Viktorin, 1998).Causal, confounding or random? The combination of low exposure and risk estimates extrapolated from high-level exposure, would not suggest a causal association between VOC emissions and leukaemia in our study. Our results are more coherent with those from the Australian petroleum industry, and Swedish oil refinery operators. Even if the exposure levels in the residential area we studied were very low, it is remarkable that we found an elevation of leukaemia in the parishes considered most at risk. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to their roles as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their potential carcinogenic effects. The text discusses the uncertainty in risk estimates for leukaemia associated with these compounds, indicating that both are likely linked due to their chemical structure and metabolism to carcinogenic forms. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond their mention as part of a broader discussion on VOC emissions and health risks.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are discussed in the context of their potential health risks related to leukaemia, indicating a shared significance in the study of VOCs, but lacking detailed interaction or specific evidence of their relationship.",
