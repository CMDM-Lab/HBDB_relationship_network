    "context": "In the previous epidemiological study, it was observed that higher exposure to NO2 increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers (Vineis et al., 2007). Because they have more rapid rate of respiration and so inhale more pollutants per kg of body weight than adults, children are more susceptible to air pollution. Traffic exhaust is a major cause of children's exposure to air pollutants (IARC, 1989) and several authors in US as well as in Europe found a positive correlation between local traffic density at time of diagnosis and childhood leukemias with an estimated relative risk between 1.6 and 4.7 (Wertheimer and Leeper, 1979; Savitz and Feingold, 1989; Feychting et al., 1998; Harrison et al., 1999).Indoor air pollution Indoor air pollution is a growing scientific concern because indoor air can accumulate many carcinogenic pollutants. In addition to carbon particles and PAH, indoor air can accumulate ETS as well as chemicals such as biocides and also formaldehyde in addition to volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, which have been rated as carcinogens by IARC (1995b). The risk of lung cancer due to ETS exposure is much higher at work than at home and higher for ex-smokers than for never smokers (Vineis et al., 2007). Since children are most affected by chronic household exposure, they may be at higher risk of cancer. Particularly of concern is the association between parental and/or childhood exposure and the risk of childhood cancers and cancers in adulthood. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can accumulate in indoor air and are classified as carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). While both terms refer to similar chemical structures, the context does not provide a detailed discussion of their specific relationship or differences, focusing instead on their implications for health risks associated with air pollution.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as both are categorized as VOCs and carcinogens. However, the context lacks detailed discussion on their specific interactions or comparative significance, limiting the relevance of their relationship.",
