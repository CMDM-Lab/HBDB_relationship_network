    "context": "[1] Results: Compared with controls, women who engaged in regular home cooking had significantly higher levels of mercapturic acids of acrolein {geometric mean, 1,959 pmol/mg creatinine [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1,554-2,467] versus 1,370 (95% CI, 1,077-1,742); P = 0.038}, crotonaldehyde [geometric mean, 232 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 193-277) versus 142 (95% CI, 118-171); P = 0.0004], and benzene [geometric mean, 0.58 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 0.44-0.78) [2] versus 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.24); [3] P < 0.0001]. [4] No significant differences were found in levels of mercapturic acids of 1,3-butadiene, metabolites of pyrene and phenanthrene, or acetaldehyde-leukocyte DNA adduct levels between the groups. [5] Levels of the ethylene oxide mercapturic acid were significantly higher in the controls. [1] Conclusions: The higher levels of the mercapturic acid of benzene, a multiorgan carcinogen, in the women who cooked are particularly notable. [2] Overall, the results showing increased exposure to the volatile toxicants and carcinogens acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and benzene in Chinese women who regularly cook provide a plausible lead for further investigating the role of volatile compounds generated during high-temperature cooking with oils as causes of lung cancer.

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and phenanthrene are both mentioned as metabolites analyzed in relation to exposure levels in women who engage in regular home cooking. However, the study found no significant differences in the levels of mercapturic acids of buta-1,3-diene or phenanthrene between the cooking and control groups, indicating a lack of direct relationship or impact from cooking activities on their levels.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are part of the study's analysis of exposure to volatile organic compounds, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance in the context provided.",
