    "context": "[1] Results: Compared with controls, women who engaged in regular home cooking had significantly higher levels of mercapturic acids of acrolein {geometric mean, 1,959 pmol/mg creatinine [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1,554-2,467] versus 1,370 (95% CI, 1,077-1,742); P = 0.038}, crotonaldehyde [geometric mean, 232 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 193-277) versus 142 (95% CI, 118-171); P = 0.0004], and benzene [geometric mean, 0.58 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 0.44-0.78) [2] versus 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.24); [3] P < 0.0001]. [4] No significant differences were found in levels of mercapturic acids of 1,3-butadiene, metabolites of pyrene and phenanthrene, or acetaldehyde-leukocyte DNA adduct levels between the groups. [5] Levels of the ethylene oxide mercapturic acid were significantly higher in the controls. [1] Conclusions: The higher levels of the mercapturic acid of benzene, a multiorgan carcinogen, in the women who cooked are particularly notable. [2] Overall, the results showing increased exposure to the volatile toxicants and carcinogens acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and benzene in Chinese women who regularly cook provide a plausible lead for further investigating the role of volatile compounds generated during high-temperature cooking with oils as causes of lung cancer.

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned alongside its metabolites, specifically in relation to the levels of mercapturic acids. However, the study indicates that there were no significant differences in the levels of mercapturic acids of 1,3-butadiene between the groups studied. This suggests that while buta-1,3-diene is a compound of interest, its metabolites did not show a notable relationship or impact in the context of the cooking exposure being investigated.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as buta-1,3-diene and its metabolites are mentioned together, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or significant findings regarding their interaction in the study.",
