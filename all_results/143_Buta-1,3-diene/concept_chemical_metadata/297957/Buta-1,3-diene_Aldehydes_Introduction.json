    "context": "[7] In one recent study, a strong link was observed between lung cancer risk and cooking dish-years, a measure of lifetime cooking by stir frying, deep frying, or frying in a wok, common in Chinese households . [8] A working group of the IARC concluded that emissions from high-temperature frying are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)\u00e2\u20ac\u009d . [1] Several studies have analyzed fumes generated during high-temperature cooking with various oils. [2] A variety of carcinogens and toxicants have been detected in the fumes, including acetaldehyde, acrolein, various higher aldehydes, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH; refs. [3] -). [4] Benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and a representative PAH, benzo[a]pyrene, are considered carcinogenic to humans by IARC, whereas acetaldehyde is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (-). [5] Acrolein, a well-known toxicant and cilia-toxic agent, is rated as not classifiable for carcinogenicity . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and aldehydes are both identified as harmful compounds generated during high-temperature cooking processes. The text highlights that various carcinogens, including Buta-1,3-diene and several aldehydes like acetaldehyde, are released in cooking fumes, linking them to potential cancer risks. This suggests a shared relevance in the context of cooking-related carcinogenic exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Buta-1,3-diene and aldehydes, as both are mentioned as carcinogenic compounds found in cooking fumes. Their inclusion in the same discussion about health risks from cooking emissions indicates a clear relationship, supported by evidence of their toxicological profiles.",
        "score": 4
