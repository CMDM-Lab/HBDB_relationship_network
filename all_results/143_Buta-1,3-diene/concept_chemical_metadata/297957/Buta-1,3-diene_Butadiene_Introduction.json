    "context": "[4] Benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and a representative PAH, benzo[a]pyrene, are considered carcinogenic to humans by IARC, whereas acetaldehyde is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (-). [5] Acrolein, a well-known toxicant and cilia-toxic agent, is rated as not classifiable for carcinogenicity . [1] There are no reports of biomarker studies to assess carcinogen and toxicant uptake in Chinese women who regularly cook at home. [2] Therefore, in this study, we determined levels of biomarkers of exposure to acrolein, crotonaldehyde, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, acetaldehyde, and PAH in nonsmoking, nonalcohol drinking Chinese women from Singapore who reported doing home cooking \u00e2\u2030\u00a55 days per week and in Chinese women who were randomly chosen among the participants of the population-based Singapore Chinese Health Study. [1] Forty-two women volunteers who enrolled in a study on food mutagens  constituted one group of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regular cooks\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in this study. [2] The subjects were identified using a combination of purposive sampling and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snowballing.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d [3] Criteria for participation were that they should be Singapore residents, of Chinese ethnicity, nonsmokers, and that they cooked regularly at home \u00e2\u2030\u00a55 days a week.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned as part of a list of carcinogenic substances evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). However, the terms are used interchangeably, as Buta-1,3-diene is a common name for Butadiene. The context does not provide any additional information on their specific relationship or distinct characteristics beyond their classification as carcinogens.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are essentially the same compound, but the context does not elaborate on their relationship or differences, merely listing them among other carcinogens.",
