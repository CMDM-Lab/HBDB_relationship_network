    "context": "[7] In one recent study, a strong link was observed between lung cancer risk and cooking dish-years, a measure of lifetime cooking by stir frying, deep frying, or frying in a wok, common in Chinese households . [8] A working group of the IARC concluded that emissions from high-temperature frying are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A)\u00e2\u20ac\u009d . [1] Several studies have analyzed fumes generated during high-temperature cooking with various oils. [2] A variety of carcinogens and toxicants have been detected in the fumes, including acetaldehyde, acrolein, various higher aldehydes, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH; refs. [3] -). [4] Benzene, 1,3-butadiene, ethylene oxide, and a representative PAH, benzo[a]pyrene, are considered carcinogenic to humans by IARC, whereas acetaldehyde is classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (-). [5] Acrolein, a well-known toxicant and cilia-toxic agent, is rated as not classifiable for carcinogenicity . ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Polycyclic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are both identified as carcinogenic compounds found in fumes generated during high-temperature cooking. The study highlights the presence of various toxicants, including Buta-1,3-diene and PAHs, in cooking emissions, linking them to increased lung cancer risk. Both compounds are classified as harmful, with specific references to their carcinogenic potential by the IARC, indicating a significant relationship in terms of health risks associated with cooking methods.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between Buta-1,3-diene and PAHs, as both are identified as carcinogens in cooking emissions. The context provides evidence of their presence and potential health risks, indicating a significant relationship in the realm of carcinogenicity.",
        "score": 4
