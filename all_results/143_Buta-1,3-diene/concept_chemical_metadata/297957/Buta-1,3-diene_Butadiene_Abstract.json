    "context": "[1] Results: Compared with controls, women who engaged in regular home cooking had significantly higher levels of mercapturic acids of acrolein {geometric mean, 1,959 pmol/mg creatinine [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1,554-2,467] versus 1,370 (95% CI, 1,077-1,742); P = 0.038}, crotonaldehyde [geometric mean, 232 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 193-277) versus 142 (95% CI, 118-171); P = 0.0004], and benzene [geometric mean, 0.58 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 0.44-0.78) [2] versus 0.18 (95% CI, 0.14-0.24); [3] P < 0.0001]. [4] No significant differences were found in levels of mercapturic acids of 1,3-butadiene, metabolites of pyrene and phenanthrene, or acetaldehyde-leukocyte DNA adduct levels between the groups. [5] Levels of the ethylene oxide mercapturic acid were significantly higher in the controls. [1] Conclusions: The higher levels of the mercapturic acid of benzene, a multiorgan carcinogen, in the women who cooked are particularly notable. [2] Overall, the results showing increased exposure to the volatile toxicants and carcinogens acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and benzene in Chinese women who regularly cook provide a plausible lead for further investigating the role of volatile compounds generated during high-temperature cooking with oils as causes of lung cancer.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to exposure levels of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their metabolites. However, the context does not provide a direct relationship or comparison between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as it primarily focuses on other compounds and their mercapturic acids. Both terms refer to similar chemical structures, but their specific interactions or implications in the study are not discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are both mentioned in the context of VOCs, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or specific interactions. They are related by category but not by direct relevance in this study.",
