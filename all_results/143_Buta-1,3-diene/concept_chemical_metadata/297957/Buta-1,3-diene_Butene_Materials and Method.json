    "context": "[3] Windows, especially those in the kitchen, are usually open for ventilation during cooking. [1] Both buffy coat and urine specimens from each chosen subject were retrieved from storage in \u00e2\u02c6\u201980\u00c2\u00b0C freezers at the National University of Singapore and shipped in boxes packed with dry ice to the University of Minnesota, where the laboratory measurement took place. [2] The Institutional Review Boards at the University of Minnesota and the National University of Singapore approved the study. [1] Urinary mercapturic acid metabolites of the following were quantified: for acrolein [3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (HPMA)], for crotonaldehyde [4-hydroxybut-2-yl mercapturic acid (HBMA)], for benzene [S-phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA)], for 1,3-butadiene [1-hydroxy-2-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-3-butene and 1-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-2-hydroxy-3-butene, collectively called monohydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (MHBMA)], and for ethylene oxide [(N-acetylcysteinyl)ethanol, also called 2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid (HEMA)]. [2] Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP) and r-1,t-2,3,c-4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene (PheT), metabolites of the PAH pyrene and phenanthrene, were also quantified. [3] As a measure of exposure to acetaldehyde, leukocyte DNA adducts were measured. [4] The analyses for the mercapturic acids , 1-HOP , and PheT  were carried out essentially as described previously.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butene are both mentioned as metabolites related to exposure assessments in a study measuring urinary mercapturic acid metabolites. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical relationship or interaction. They are part of a broader analysis of various compounds, indicating they may share a category as volatile organic compounds but lack a specific connection in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Buta-1,3-diene and Butene are mentioned in the context of exposure analysis, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating a general category rather than a detailed interaction.",
