[6] There were no differences in levels of the urinary biomarkers MHBMA from 1,3-butadiene, 1-HOP from pyrene, PheT from phenanthrene, or N2-ethylidene-dG from acetaldehyde. [7] Levels of urinary HEMA from ethylene oxide were significantly lower in the daily cooks than in the random controls [20.1 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 18.4-24.7) [8] versus 28.3 (95% CI, 23.1-34.7); [9] P = 0.02].

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and phenanthrene are both mentioned as sources of urinary biomarkers in a study comparing daily cooks to random controls. Specifically, the urinary biomarker PheT is associated with phenanthrene, while MHBMA is linked to buta-1,3-diene. However, the context does not elaborate on any direct interaction or significant relationship between the two compounds beyond their presence as metabolites in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as buta-1,3-diene and phenanthrene are connected through their respective urinary biomarkers but lack a detailed discussion of their interaction or significance in the context.",
