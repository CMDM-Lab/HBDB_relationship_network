[5] Women who did frequent home cooking also showed statistically significantly elevated levels of summed mercapturic acid metabolites [geometric mean, 2,476 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 1,940-3,158) versus 1,622 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 1,281-2,053); P = 0.016] and elevated summed rank scores (median score, 284 versus 224; P = 0.002). [6] There were no differences in levels of the urinary biomarkers MHBMA from 1,3-butadiene, 1-HOP from pyrene, PheT from phenanthrene, or N2-ethylidene-dG from acetaldehyde. [7] Levels of urinary HEMA from ethylene oxide were significantly lower in the daily cooks than in the random controls [20.1 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 18.4-24.7) [8] versus 28.3 (95% CI, 23.1-34.7); [9] P = 0.02].

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to urinary biomarkers, specifically focusing on the metabolites derived from exposure to these compounds. Buta-1,3-diene is a specific isomer of Butadiene, and both are relevant in studies of environmental exposure and health effects. However, the context does not elaborate on their distinct roles or interactions, merely noting their presence in the analysis of urinary biomarkers.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are both related to the same class of compounds and their metabolites are analyzed in the same study. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
