    "context": "[3] Windows, especially those in the kitchen, are usually open for ventilation during cooking. [1] Both buffy coat and urine specimens from each chosen subject were retrieved from storage in \u00e2\u02c6\u201980\u00c2\u00b0C freezers at the National University of Singapore and shipped in boxes packed with dry ice to the University of Minnesota, where the laboratory measurement took place. [2] The Institutional Review Boards at the University of Minnesota and the National University of Singapore approved the study. [1] Urinary mercapturic acid metabolites of the following were quantified: for acrolein [3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (HPMA)], for crotonaldehyde [4-hydroxybut-2-yl mercapturic acid (HBMA)], for benzene [S-phenyl mercapturic acid (SPMA)], for 1,3-butadiene [1-hydroxy-2-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-3-butene and 1-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-2-hydroxy-3-butene, collectively called monohydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (MHBMA)], and for ethylene oxide [(N-acetylcysteinyl)ethanol, also called 2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid (HEMA)]. [2] Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HOP) and r-1,t-2,3,c-4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene (PheT), metabolites of the PAH pyrene and phenanthrene, were also quantified. [3] As a measure of exposure to acetaldehyde, leukocyte DNA adducts were measured. [4] The analyses for the mercapturic acids , 1-HOP , and PheT  were carried out essentially as described previously.

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is linked to its urinary metabolites, specifically the mercapturic acid metabolites known as monohydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (MHBMA). These metabolites are quantified to assess exposure to Buta-1,3-diene, indicating a direct relationship where the metabolites serve as biomarkers for the presence and effects of Buta-1,3-diene in the body. The study highlights the importance of measuring these metabolites to understand the exposure levels and potential health impacts associated with Buta-1,3-diene.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene is directly connected to its metabolites, which are used as biomarkers for exposure assessment. The context provides clear evidence of this relationship, emphasizing the significance of these metabolites in evaluating the effects of Buta-1,3-diene.",
