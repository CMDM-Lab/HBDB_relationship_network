[5] Women who did frequent home cooking also showed statistically significantly elevated levels of summed mercapturic acid metabolites [geometric mean, 2,476 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 1,940-3,158) versus 1,622 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 1,281-2,053); P = 0.016] and elevated summed rank scores (median score, 284 versus 224; P = 0.002). [6] There were no differences in levels of the urinary biomarkers MHBMA from 1,3-butadiene, 1-HOP from pyrene, PheT from phenanthrene, or N2-ethylidene-dG from acetaldehyde. [7] Levels of urinary HEMA from ethylene oxide were significantly lower in the daily cooks than in the random controls [20.1 pmol/mg creatinine (95% CI, 18.4-24.7) [8] versus 28.3 (95% CI, 23.1-34.7); [9] P = 0.02].

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as urinary biomarkers related to exposure from cooking activities. However, the study indicates that there were no significant differences in the levels of urinary biomarkers from buta-1,3-diene and acetaldehyde among the groups studied. This suggests that while both compounds are relevant in the context of exposure, their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon, indicating a lack of direct connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both buta-1,3-diene and acetaldehyde are discussed in relation to urinary biomarkers, but there is no detailed interaction or significant relationship established between them in the context provided.",
