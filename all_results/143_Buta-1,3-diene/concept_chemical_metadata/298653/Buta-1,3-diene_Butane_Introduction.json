    "context": "This finding provides support for use of this internal dose metric in interspecies extrapolation for human non-cancer risk assessment for BD. Sensitivity analyses of a preliminary human PBTK model designed to eventually assess human reproductive risk from BD exposures suggest that key parameters for predicting blood DEB include rate constants for EB epoxidation and EB and DEB hydrolysis, the blood:air partition coefficient for BD, and blood flow to the liver. Given the variation and/or uncertainty regarding the values of these metabolic rate constants that are currently available, a well-validated human PBTK model will enhance the precision of interspecies extrapolations conducted as part of a human health risk assessment. 1,3-Butadiene (BD) 2 Abreviations used: BD, 1,3-butadiene; VOC, volatile organic chemical; PBPK, physiologically based pharmacokinetic; EB, epoxybutene; DEB, 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane; CYP, cytochrome P450; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; M2, an isomeric mixture of 1-hydroxy-2-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-3-butene and 2-hydroxy-1-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-3-butene; EH, epoxide hydrolase; BD-diol, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-butene or epoxybutanediol; HMVK, hydroxymethylvinyl ketone; M1, 1,2-dihydroxy-4-(N-acetylcysteinyl)-butane; V max, maximal velocity; K m, substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of V max; GSH, glutathione; RAgshT, rate equation for GSH levels; kPgshT, tissue specific zero order rate of GSH synthesis; kEgsh, first order rate of basal GSH elimination; VT, tissue volume; CgshT, tissue concentration of GSH; RAMTgsh, rate of conjugation of GSH and EB; PNNL, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 2 (CAS No. 106-99-0) is a colorless and mildly aromatic gas. It is commonly used in the manufacturing of tires, shoes, sponges, hoses, luggage, and a variety of molded products. BD is also a constituent of tobacco smoke, gasoline vapors, and vapors from the burning of plastics and rubber, and has been detected at low part-per-billion levels in outdoor air. BD is a known human carcinogen and has been associated with cancer in multiple sites, as well as non-carcinogenic outcomes, notably reproductive toxicity in animals. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene (BD) and Butane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to human health risk assessments. However, the focus is primarily on BD's carcinogenic properties and its metabolic pathways, with no direct comparison or interaction with Butane discussed. They are related as VOCs but lack a significant functional relationship in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene and Butane are both categorized as VOCs, but their relationship is not explored in detail. The context emphasizes BD's health risks without establishing a direct connection to Butane.",
        "score": 2
