    "context": "The measurements were carried out between Tuesday and Friday of 1 week. Each sampling period lasted for 5h. The airborne concentrations of tobacco-specific markers, 3-ethenylpyridine and nicotine, were measured in order to detect whether the non-smoking areas were smoke-free and to establish the concentration of ETS in smoking areas. Furthermore, the levels of 14 additional compounds were measured: 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, benzene, pyridine, toluene, furfuryl aldehyde, 3-picoline, ethyl benzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, phenol, limonene, and naphthalene.Sampling The measurements were carried out using four different samplers. For the purposes of method comparison of the markers (reported elsewhere), three different samplers were used for 3-EP and two for nicotine. 3-EP was collected on 3M (OVM 3500) diffusive sampler; the sampling rate was 24ml/min. 3-EP and nicotine were collected in charcoal tubes (SKC 226-01) with a pump at a rate of 100ml/min (smoking section) or 200ml/min (non-smoking section).

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and phenols are both mentioned as part of a broader analysis of airborne compounds, particularly in relation to tobacco smoke and environmental monitoring. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the list of measured compounds. They are part of a larger study on tobacco-specific markers, but their relationship is not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene and phenols are listed together among various airborne compounds without any detailed discussion of their interaction or significance in the context of the study.",
        "score": 2
