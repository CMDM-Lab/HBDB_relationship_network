    "context": "Isoprene and 1,3-BD correlated well with 3-EP and nicotine and their concentrations were higher than those of 3-picoline and pyridine. Isoprene is a more suitable marker than 1,3-BD, because it is easier to measure than the gas-phase compound 1,3-BD. Furthermore, its emission is higher than that of 1,3-BD and the background concentrations are low. Also, results from other studies support the possible use of isoprene as an ETS marker (L\u00f6froth et al., 1989).Conclusions The method for 1,3-butadiene and isoprene proved to be precise, sensitive and usable in laboratory tests and field measurements. A more comprehensive validation is, however, needed if the method's performance in other environments is to be confirmed. A very good correlation was found between seven of the studied compounds (1,3-BD, isoprene, pyridine, furfuryl aldehyde, 3-picoline, phenol and styrene) and the ETS markers (3-EP and nicotine). The compounds were regarded as specific for ETS in restaurant environments. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (1,3-BD) and isoprene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are analyzed for their correlation with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) markers. The study indicates that isoprene is a more suitable marker than 1,3-BD due to its higher emission levels and easier measurement. Both compounds show a good correlation with other studied compounds in relation to ETS, suggesting their relevance in environmental monitoring.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between buta-1,3-diene and isoprene, as both are discussed in the context of their correlation with ETS markers. The study provides evidence supporting the use of isoprene over 1,3-BD, indicating a clear relationship in their environmental significance.",
