    "context": "3-EP and nicotine were collected in charcoal tubes (SKC 226-01) with a pump at a rate of 100ml/min (smoking section) or 200ml/min (non-smoking section). The pumps were manufactured by SKC (222 series). Benzene, pyridine, toluene, furfuryl aldehyde, 3-picoline, ethyl benzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, phenol, limonene, naphthalene plus 3-EP, and nicotine were collected in Tenax steel tubes (stainless steel, Perkin-Elmer or Supelco, Tenax TA 60/80 mesh, Chrompack; 150mg/tube) with a pump at 60\u201370ml/min. 1,3-Butadiene and isoprene were collected in Carbopack X steel tubes (stainless steel, Perkin-Elmer or Supelco, Carbopack X 60/80 mesh, Supelco; 300mg/tube) with a pump at 50ml/min. The sampling of 1,3-butadiene was based on a recent method (Martin et al., 2005), and the performance of Carbopack X tubes (sampling volume, breakthrough and the storage stability) was tested prior to the field measurements. Performance of the sampling of 1,3-BD was tested by collecting parallel air samples from a parking garage knowing that exhaust gas of the vehicles contains low concentrations of 1,3-BD. The sampling capacity of Carbopack X tubes was tested for two loads of the adsorbent (200 or 300mg/tube) and by using two consecutive tubes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) collected using similar sampling methods in air quality studies. They are mentioned together in the context of air sampling techniques, indicating they may be analyzed for their presence in environmental samples, particularly in relation to vehicle emissions. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as buta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both VOCs mentioned in the same sampling context, but their relationship is not explored beyond their co-collection for analysis.",
        "score": 2
