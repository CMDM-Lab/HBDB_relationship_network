    "context": "The pumps were manufactured by SKC (222 series). Benzene, pyridine, toluene, furfuryl aldehyde, 3-picoline, ethyl benzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, phenol, limonene, naphthalene plus 3-EP, and nicotine were collected in Tenax steel tubes (stainless steel, Perkin-Elmer or Supelco, Tenax TA 60/80 mesh, Chrompack; 150mg/tube) with a pump at 60\u201370ml/min. 1,3-Butadiene and isoprene were collected in Carbopack X steel tubes (stainless steel, Perkin-Elmer or Supelco, Carbopack X 60/80 mesh, Supelco; 300mg/tube) with a pump at 50ml/min. The sampling of 1,3-butadiene was based on a recent method (Martin et al., 2005), and the performance of Carbopack X tubes (sampling volume, breakthrough and the storage stability) was tested prior to the field measurements. Performance of the sampling of 1,3-BD was tested by collecting parallel air samples from a parking garage knowing that exhaust gas of the vehicles contains low concentrations of 1,3-BD. The sampling capacity of Carbopack X tubes was tested for two loads of the adsorbent (200 or 300mg/tube) and by using two consecutive tubes. Air was sucked by pumps (SKC 222 series) at 50\u201360ml/min for 5\u20136h.Analysis of 3M and charcoal tube samples 3-EP was desorbed from 3M samplers and charcoal tubes using pyridine/toluene solution (15%) and analysed by a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MSD) (Vainiotalo et al., 2001; Kuusim\u00e4ki et al., 2006).

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is commonly abbreviated as butadiene. The text discusses the sampling and analysis methods for 1,3-butadiene in air, indicating its relevance in environmental monitoring. However, the terms are used interchangeably without further elaboration on their specific relationship or differences.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship, as Buta-1,3-diene is simply another name for Butadiene. The context confirms their equivalence in the discussion of sampling methods, indicating a strong relevance.",
        "score": 5
