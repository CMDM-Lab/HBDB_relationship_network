    "context": "An inferior or no correlation was found between the markers and seven of the studied compounds (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, m,p-xylene, o-xylene, limonene and naphthalene), which were thus regarded unspecific for ETS in restaurant environment. The concentrations of ETS-specific VOCs were similar to the levels detected in restaurants elsewhere, whereas those of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene) seemed to be lower. The study indicated that ETS significantly increases the levels of several toxic impurities. ETS is a considerable source of 1,3-butadiene. ETS drifted from smoking to non-smoking sections in six out of the 10 restaurants. In restaurants with recent ventilation renovation or efficient separation of the non-smoking section from the smoking section, ETS did not drift to the non-smoking section (concentration of 3-ethenylpyridine \u2a7d0.2\u03bcg/m3). The location of the bar desk in the smoking area still proved problematic with reference to ETS exposure, because in all the restaurants smoke drifted to the working area behind the bar desk. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are related as they refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). The study highlights that ETS is a significant source of 1,3-butadiene, indicating its relevance in assessing air quality in restaurant environments. However, the terms are used interchangeably without further distinction or detailed discussion of their specific roles or differences.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they refer to the same compound and are discussed in the context of ETS exposure. The context provides evidence of Butadiene's presence as a toxic impurity from ETS, indicating a clear relationship.",
