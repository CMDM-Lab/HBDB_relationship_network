    "context": "[23] The Dyson orbitals for n-butane reveal that the 22Ag excited state has the fewest nodal planes; hence, this state experiences the least suppression, rendering it the dominant SFI channel as seen in Fig. 3A.  [1] (A) TDSE calculations of half-cycle ionization yields for producing the lowest few ionic states for the dominant conformers of 1,3-butadiene (left) and n-butane (right).  [2] The intensity was set to 1.5 \u00c3\u2014 1013 W/cm2 at a wavelength of 800 nm.  [3] For 1,3-butadiene, ground-state ionization is strongly favored, whereas for n-butane excited-state ionization is more probable.  [4] For more details, see the SOM.  [5] (B) TDSE calculations of half-cycle ionization yields for n-butane into the 2Ag ionic ground state and the strongest coupled ionic excited state (2Bu), shown both with (purple) and without (blue) laser-driven nonresonant interchannel dipole coupling (also known as NME) between the ionic states, for a higher intensity of 1.5 \u00c3\u2014 1014 W/cm2 at a wavelength of 800 nm.  [6] Channel-resolved ionization yields for two molecular frame field directions, x and y, are presented in the middle and right panels, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to their ionization properties and behavior under specific experimental conditions. However, the context primarily focuses on the ionization yields and excited states of 1,3-butadiene and n-butane, without providing a detailed discussion on the relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene. They are likely referring to the same compound, but the context does not clarify this connection explicitly.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms refer to similar chemical structures, but the context does not elaborate on their relationship or specific interactions beyond their mention in the same study.",
