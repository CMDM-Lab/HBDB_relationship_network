    "context": "[23] The Dyson orbitals for n-butane reveal that the 22Ag excited state has the fewest nodal planes; hence, this state experiences the least suppression, rendering it the dominant SFI channel as seen in Fig. 3A.  [1] (A) TDSE calculations of half-cycle ionization yields for producing the lowest few ionic states for the dominant conformers of 1,3-butadiene (left) and n-butane (right).  [2] The intensity was set to 1.5 \u00c3\u2014 1013 W/cm2 at a wavelength of 800 nm.  [3] For 1,3-butadiene, ground-state ionization is strongly favored, whereas for n-butane excited-state ionization is more probable.  [4] For more details, see the SOM.  [5] (B) TDSE calculations of half-cycle ionization yields for n-butane into the 2Ag ionic ground state and the strongest coupled ionic excited state (2Bu), shown both with (purple) and without (blue) laser-driven nonresonant interchannel dipole coupling (also known as NME) between the ionic states, for a higher intensity of 1.5 \u00c3\u2014 1014 W/cm2 at a wavelength of 800 nm.  [6] Channel-resolved ionization yields for two molecular frame field directions, x and y, are presented in the middle and right panels, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butane are both discussed in relation to their ionization properties under specific experimental conditions. The study compares the ionization yields of n-butane and 1,3-butadiene, highlighting differences in their ground-state and excited-state ionization tendencies. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their physical and chemical behavior rather than any direct interaction or functional relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as Buta-1,3-diene and Butane are compared in terms of their ionization characteristics, indicating they belong to the same category of organic compounds. However, there is no detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interactions.",
