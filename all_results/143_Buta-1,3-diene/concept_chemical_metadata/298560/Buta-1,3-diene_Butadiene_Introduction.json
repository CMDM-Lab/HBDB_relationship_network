    "context": "Noting the significant species differences in the toxicity of 1,3-butadiene (BD), four groups of researchers developed physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models of BD in mice and rats. These models were developed on the premise that differences in the circulating concentrations of epoxybutene (butadiene monoepoxide, EB), and/or diepoxybutane (butadiene diepoxide, DEB) may be responsible for induction of tumors in mice at much lower exposure concentrations than were necessary to produce tumors in the rat. Blood concentrations of diepoxide alone may not entirely explain the differences in carcinogenicity, but they most likely play an important role. In June, 1998, the Chemical Industry Institute of Technology (CIIT) Workshop on Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of 1,3-Butadiene convened. At this workshop, a computer session was held in which developers of all four models used their models to simulate identical exposures. The simulations were for exposures of rats or mice to 10, 62.5 or 1250 ppm BD for 6 h. A good deal of concordance among the models was found with regard to predicted blood concentrations of BD, EB, and DEB at two to six h of exposure (Fig. 1 ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene (BD), which is discussed in terms of its toxicity and carcinogenic potential. The text highlights the development of physiologically based toxicokinetic models to understand the differences in toxicity between species, particularly focusing on the metabolites of butadiene, such as epoxybutene and diepoxybutane. The relationship is direct, as Buta-1,3-diene is simply an alternative name for Butadiene, emphasizing their identity as the same substance in toxicological studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as they are two names for the same compound being analyzed for its toxicological effects. The context provides strong support for their equivalence in the study of toxicity and carcinogenicity.",
        "score": 5
