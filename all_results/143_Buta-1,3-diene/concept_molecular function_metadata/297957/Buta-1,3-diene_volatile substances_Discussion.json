    "context": "[3] Cigarette smoking provides a far greater exposure to these compounds than does wok cooking, so the smaller increases seen in this study are fully plausible . [4] The high biomarker levels seen in smokers are consistent with the known amounts of benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde in cigarette smoke and with the far higher risk for lung cancer from smoking compared with indoor fume exposure. [1] We did not observe increases in biomarkers of exposure to 1,3-butadiene or PAH. [2] Levels of 1,3-butadiene in fumes from heated oils are far lower than those of several other volatile compounds such as acrolein . [3] Therefore, this result is not unexpected. [4] Although PAHs have been identified in cooking oil fumes , they are high molecular weight, nonvolatile compounds. [5] Thus, their uptake under normal cooking circumstances would be less likely than that of the more volatile compounds such as benzene, acrolein, and crotonaldehyde. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to other volatile substances, particularly in the comparison of exposure levels from cigarette smoke and cooking fumes. The study indicates that levels of buta-1,3-diene in heated oils are significantly lower than those of more volatile compounds like acrolein. This suggests that while buta-1,3-diene is categorized as a volatile substance, its presence in cooking fumes is minimal compared to other more harmful volatile compounds, indicating a lesser concern for exposure in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as buta-1,3-diene is discussed in the context of volatile substances, but the relationship is primarily comparative rather than indicating a direct interaction or significant health impact.",
        "score": 3
