    "context": "These results suggests that PAH metabolites cannot be used as unequivocal biomarkers of airborne ETS and PAH exposures. Our study also presents novel data showing significant relationships between urinary excretion of the nicotine metabolites, cotinine and trans-3\u2032-hydroxycotinine and the gas-phase ETS marker, 3-ethenylpyridine. This serves to confirm the value of 3-ethenylpyridine as a chemical marker of ETS exposure which can be used in studies where it is not practicable to take urine samples. Furthermore we demonstrate significant associations between the urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and personal airborne exposures to 1,3-butadiene and benzo(a)pyrene, which IARC classifies as a known human carcinogen. In the context of the measured exposures, it appears that ETS is an important source of 1,3-butadiene and benzo(a)pyrene exposure. In the case of the other higher molecular weight PAH (benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, we found significant correlations between the atmospheric exposures to these compounds and the concentrations of urinary nicotine metabolites. Correlations of the sum of the medium molecular weight PAH (fluoranthene to chrysene) and of the sum of high molecular weight PAH (benzo(b)fluoranthene to coronene) with cotinine and trans-3\u2032-hydroxycotinine were statistically significant.

        "summary": "In this context, 1,3-butadiene is associated with urinary concentrations of nicotine metabolites, indicating that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may lead to increased urinary excretion of these metabolites. The study highlights significant correlations between personal airborne exposures to 1,3-butadiene and the concentrations of urinary nicotine metabolites, suggesting that urinary concentration can serve as a biomarker for exposure to this compound in the context of ETS.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 1,3-butadiene and urinary concentration, supported by statistical correlations indicating that urinary metabolites can be indicative of exposure levels. This relationship is particularly relevant in the context of environmental tobacco smoke exposure.",
