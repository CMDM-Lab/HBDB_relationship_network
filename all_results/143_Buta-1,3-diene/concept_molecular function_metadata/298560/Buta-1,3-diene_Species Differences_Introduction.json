    "context": "(3) Although there are a number of external factors that show in-vitro effects on 2E1 metabolism, such as alcohol, diet, prescription drugs, and over-the-counter mediations, there were no evident effects on metabolic rate. Thus, the causes of the observed wide variability remain to be discovered. These factors must be determined and considered in a risk assessment to obtain a meaningful representation of the exposed population risks. Noting the significant species differences in the toxicity of 1,3-butadiene (BD), four groups of researchers developed physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models of BD in mice and rats. These models were developed on the premise that differences in the circulating concentrations of epoxybutene (butadiene monoepoxide, EB), and/or diepoxybutane (butadiene diepoxide, DEB) may be responsible for induction of tumors in mice at much lower exposure concentrations than were necessary to produce tumors in the rat. Blood concentrations of diepoxide alone may not entirely explain the differences in carcinogenicity, but they most likely play an important role. In June, 1998, the Chemical Industry Institute of Technology (CIIT) Workshop on Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Modeling of 1,3-Butadiene convened. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to species differences in its toxicity, particularly between mice and rats. The research highlights that the observed variability in tumor induction at different exposure levels may be attributed to differences in the metabolism of BD and its metabolites, such as epoxybutene and diepoxybutane. The development of physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models aims to elucidate these species differences, suggesting that the metabolic response to BD is crucial for understanding its carcinogenic potential across different species.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between buta-1,3-diene and species differences, as the context provides evidence of how metabolic variations influence toxicity and tumor induction in different animal models. The mention of PBTK models further supports this relationship.",
