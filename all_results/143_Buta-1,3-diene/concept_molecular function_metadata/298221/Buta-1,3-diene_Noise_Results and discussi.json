    "context": "Since the per-cigarette deliveries of acrolein and 1,3-butadiene as measured using TDL spectroscopy are sums of the individual puff deliveries, one must conclude that the per puff data measured using TDL spectroscopy are valid as well. Since the TDL technique delivers per puff information using individual cigarettes, rather than an average per-cigarette delivery measured from smoke collected from 5 or 10 cigarettes, this technique can be useful in correlating sensory data with smoke constituent delivery in an effort to produce a cigarette that delivers significantly lower levels of these smoke constituents and also is acceptable to the consumer. The relatively low per puff 1,3-butadiene and acrolein deliveries for Carbon C can be measured because of the excellent detection limit of this TDL method. The peak-to-peak noise of the instrument response between puffs during smoking for 1,3-butadiene and acrolein corresponded to 0.02ppmV and 0.1ppmV, respectively. Therefore, the limit of detection (LOD), calculated at 3\u03c3 and based on a puff volume of 35ml, is 4ng/puff and 24ng/puff, respectively. The detection capability of the TDL method is an improvement compared to a non-quantitative, comparative GC/MS method. The main advantage of the GC/MS approach is that many more smoke constituents can be monitored simultaneously in one experiment than possible using TDL spectroscopy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to its detection using TDL spectroscopy, which also measures the peak-to-peak noise of the instrument response during smoking. The noise levels for buta-1,3-diene are specified, indicating that while the detection of this compound is being assessed, the noise is a factor in the measurement process. However, there is no direct biological or chemical relationship established between buta-1,3-diene and noise beyond the technical aspects of measurement.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related through the measurement process in TDL spectroscopy. However, their relationship lacks detailed discussion or significance beyond the context of instrument performance.",
