    "context": "As a consequence of this misclassification, sensitivity will be reduced for detecting cancer risk in exposed populations, and the findings across small populations will be variable, which is consistent with the epidemiologic findings. BD is classified as a suspected human carcinogen by IARC, but the cancer risk is uncertain and controversial. Genetic polymorphisms have been observed to affect metabolic rates for both activation and deactivation enzymes important for BD epoxides. The P450 CYP2E1 and CYP2A6 enzymes have been identified as the major phase I oxidation enzymes for butadiene, and both are polymorphic. Alterations in the DraI at intron 6 for CYP2E1 showed changes in protein expression and catalytic activity. The CYP2A6 also has several polymorphisms that affect its activity. The most common variant is CYP2A6*2, which has an exon 3 mutation that results in an inactive protein. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to the CYP2E1 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of BD. The text highlights that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2E1 gene can influence the enzyme's expression and activity, thereby affecting the metabolic rates of BD and its associated cancer risk. This suggests a significant relationship between BD exposure and the genetic factors that modulate its metabolism through CYP2E1.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between buta-1,3-diene and the CYP2E1 gene, as the context discusses how genetic variations in CYP2E1 impact the metabolism of BD, which is crucial for understanding cancer risk associated with BD exposure.",
