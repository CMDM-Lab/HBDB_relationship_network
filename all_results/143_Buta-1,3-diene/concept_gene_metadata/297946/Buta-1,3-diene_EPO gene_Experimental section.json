    "context": "An ETS questionnaire was filled out when the subjects were exposed to ETS (once per event). Further details of the questionnaires can be found in Harrison et al. (2009). 2.2.3 Analysis of environmental samples Three methods were employed for analysing 1,3-butadiene, the rest of the VOC and all the PAHs as described in detail in Delgado-Saborit et al. (2009a). In this study, only a selected group of VOC compounds mainly related to ETS is presented jointly with the urinary biomarker data, which included 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP), 1,3-butadiene (BUT) and naphthalene (Naph) in the gas phase. The measured particulate-phase PAH were acenaphthylene (Ac), acenaphthene (Ace), fluorene (Fl), phenanthrene (Phe), anthracene (Ant), fluoranthene (Fluo), pyrene (Pyr), benzo(a)anthracene (BaA), chrysene (Chry), benzo(b)fluouranthene (BbF), benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), indeno(1,2,3-cd) pyrene (Ind), benzo(ghi)perylene (BghiP), dibenzo(ah)anthracene (DahA) and coronene (Cor).Biological monitoring 2.3.1 Urine collection and storage As part of the sampling protocol, the subjects provided a urine sample with the purpose of performing urinary biomarker analyses related to the air toxics under study. The first, mid-stream urine sample done in the morning \u2013 corresponding to the previous 24-h personal exposure sample \u2013 was collected every day in a 100mL polypropylene bottle from each volunteer in order to analyse a set of biomarkers present in the urine. Urine samples were collected by the researcher during the daily visit to the subjects' house, were then transferred to the laboratory in refrigerated conditions prior to storage in a \u221280\u00b0C freezer.

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) analyzed in relation to environmental exposure, while the EPO gene is not directly referenced or discussed. There is no indication of a relationship between buta-1,3-diene and the EPO gene, as the focus is on urinary biomarker analyses related to air toxics without any mention of genetic implications or interactions with the EPO gene.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between buta-1,3-diene and the EPO gene, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct or indirect connection.",
