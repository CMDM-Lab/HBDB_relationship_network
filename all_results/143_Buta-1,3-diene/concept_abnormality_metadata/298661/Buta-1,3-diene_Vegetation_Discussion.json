    "context": "For most of the top five EI sites, monitors are not located within a two mile radius of the facility property boundary, or if they are, they may be located upwind of the facility. However, the following monitoring sites reported higher annual average concentrations for olefins (Table 1) and are located within two miles of the top five EI sites: Groves (ranked #2 for 1,3-butadiene and #5 for propylene); Channelview (ranked #5 for 1,3-butadiene); HRM 7 (ranked #1 for propylene); HRM 8 (ranked #3 for propylene); and Baytown (ranked # 2 for both propylene and ethylene). Olefin monitoring data Although Texas industries are some of the major emitters of lower olefins in the nation, measured ambient air concentrations across the state for these olefins are in the low ppbv range. Measured concentrations were well below health-based AMCVs for 1,3-butadiene and isoprene, and were well below vegetation- and health-based AMCVs for ethylene. Propylene does not have an AMCV because it is a simple asphyxiant. Annual average air concentration trends from 2002 to 2012 for nine monitoring sites were not significantly different, whereas for three monitoring sites increasing trends were noted (i.e., 1,3-butadiene at Groves, isoprene at Longview, and propylene at HRM 8). The toxicological significance of these increasing concentrations was minimal since all measured concentrations were well below their relevant AMCVs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to air quality monitoring near industrial sites, with specific reference to its ambient air concentrations. The text indicates that these concentrations are well below health-based and vegetation-based ambient monitoring comparison values (AMCVs). While there is an implication that buta-1,3-diene could affect vegetation, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and the focus is primarily on air quality and health standards rather than direct impacts on vegetation.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between buta-1,3-diene and vegetation, as both are mentioned in the context of air quality monitoring. However, the relationship lacks detailed discussion or evidence of direct impact on vegetation.",
