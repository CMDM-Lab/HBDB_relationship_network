    "context": "The chemical classes with dramatical difference between the two groups were ketones and alcohols. Together with phenols, they exhibit significant differences (P <0.05) between the two groups. Furthermore, among the 36 identified metabolites, 5 of which including cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were found to be significantly different (P <0.05) between the two groups by Students\u2019 t-test based on the peak areas of all identified metabolites. In particular, extremely high levels of cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were found in malignant pleural effusions, indicating they are suitable for differentiating malignant from benign effusions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that pleural effusion chosen as tested body fluid in our work is a valuable source for observation of VOMs changes. Further studies to validate whether these statistical significant VOMs (e.g. cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) are suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis of lung cancers are being conducted in other body fluids such as blood, urine and even saliva; results will be published elsewhere.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as a metabolite that exhibits significantly higher levels in malignant pleural effusions compared to benign ones. This suggests that 2-ethylhexan-1-ol could serve as a potential biomarker for differentiating malignant pleural effusions, indicating its relevance in the diagnosis of lung cancers. The study highlights the importance of analyzing volatile organic metabolites in pleural effusions for cancer detection.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and malignant pleural effusion, as the context provides statistical evidence of its elevated levels in malignant cases, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker.",
