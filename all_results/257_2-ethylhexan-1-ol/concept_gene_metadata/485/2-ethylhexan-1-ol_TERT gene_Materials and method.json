    "context": "Several parameters related to HS-SPME extraction efficiency (fiber coating, extraction temperature and extraction time) were optimized. The proposed method was applied to comparative analysis of VOMs in malignant effusions and benign effusions. At the same time, the peak areas of all volatile metabolites were submitted to statistical analysis to obtain the specific volatile metabolites that are able to differentiate lung cancer patients from inflammatory individuals. Chemicals and samples The standard compounds of methanol, acetone, toluene, hexanal, cyclohexanone, heptanal, phenol, decane, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, acetophenone, 1, 2, 4, 5-tetramethyl benzene, dodecane, 2-methylnaphthalene and 2, 6-di(tert)butyl-4-methylpnenol were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). The explored subjects were divided into two groups: malignant group (20 patients with lung cancer) and benign inflammatory group (20 benign inflammatory patients with pneumonia or tuberculous pleurisy). The malignant group was seventeen patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and three patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The benign inflammatory group was fifteen patients with tuberculous pleurisy and five patients with pneumonia, who had no history of cancer. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is mentioned as one of the volatile organic metabolites analyzed in the study comparing lung cancer patients to those with benign inflammatory conditions. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of the TERT gene, which is often associated with cancer biology and telomerase activity. The relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the TERT gene is not established in the provided context, indicating a lack of direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that while both terms are present, there is no discussion or evidence of a relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the TERT gene in the context provided. They appear coincidentally without any direct connection.",
