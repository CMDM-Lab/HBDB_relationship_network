    "context": "Here, ketones, alcohols and benzene derivatives are the three major chemical classes in the metabolomic profile of the malignant group, whereas in the benign group, ketones and benzene derivatives are the chemical classes that contributed most to the metabolomic profile. The average peak areas of ketones and alcohols are much higher in malignant effusions compared to benign ones, clearly showing their differences in relative abundances in the two groups of effusion samples. Together with phenols, they exhibit significant differences (P <0.05) between the two groups (see Table 3). The major metabolites of the chemical class of ketones and alcohols are acetone, cyclohexanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-phenyl-2-propanol, 4-(tert)butylcyclohexanol and 4-(iso)propylcyclohexanol. In addition, the peak areas of all 36 volatile metabolites between benign and malignant groups were also compared in detail. Statistical differences between two groups were obtained by Student's t-test. Of the 36 identified metabolites, 5 compounds exhibit significant differences (P <0.05) between the two groups, whereas the others show no any significant differences. Fig. 4 displays the comparison of average peak areas of the five statistically significant metabolites in benign and malignant groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the major metabolites in the metabolomic profile of malignant effusions, while the TERT gene is not directly mentioned or linked to the analysis of these metabolites. The study focuses on the differences in volatile metabolites between benign and malignant groups, but does not establish a clear relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the TERT gene, which is typically associated with telomerase activity and cancer biology. Therefore, their connection remains unclear within this specific context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the TERT gene in the provided context. They are mentioned in the same study but without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
