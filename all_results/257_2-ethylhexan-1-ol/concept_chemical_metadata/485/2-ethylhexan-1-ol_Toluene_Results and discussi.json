    "context": "Therefore, the extraction time of 10min was selected by taking into account the fast analysis. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the above experimental results, the optimum extraction conditions were 75\u03bcm CAR/PDMS fiber with the extraction temperature at 50\u00b0C and the extraction time of 10min, using 2mL of samples. Under the optimum extraction conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) of the method was measured with 0.04\u03bcM standard solutions. The calculated LOD values were 0.020, 0.019, 0.009, 0.023 and 0.013\u03bcM for toluene, cyclohexanone, heptanal, octane and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, respectively, based on the S/N ratio (S/N=3). The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the peak area obtained with quantified ions were between 2.6% and 7.3% for these five compounds by five consecutive measurements of 0.02mM standard solution, showing good repeatability of the method.Characterization of volatile organic metabolites in malignant and benign pleural effusions Volatile organic metabolites in the collected 40 pleural effusion samples (20 malignant effusions and 20 benign effusions) were investigated by headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fig. 2 presents two typical HS-SPME-GC/MS total ion chromatograms (TICs) of VOMs in benign (a) and malignant (b) effusions. As shown in Fig. 2, 16 and 21 peaks of metabolites were observed in benign (a) and malignant (b) effusion samples, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the study of volatile organic metabolites in pleural effusions. The context primarily focuses on the extraction method and detection limits rather than any direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and toluene are both VOCs included in the same analytical study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific roles within the context provided.",
