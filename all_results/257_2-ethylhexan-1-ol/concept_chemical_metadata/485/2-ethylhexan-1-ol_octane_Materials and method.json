    "context": "For the MS measurement, ionization was executed by electron impact (EI) at 70eV. Samples were analyzed by a full scan of MS from 40 to 500amu with a scanning speed of 0.28s. All of the peak areas were obtained with quantified ions. For example, m/z 91, m/z 98, m/z 81, m/z 70 and m/z 85 for toluene, cyclohexanone, heptanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and octane, respectively.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 package for Windows (USA). Significant differences between the two groups were obtained by Student's t-test or corrected t-test. A P value of<0.05 was considered as significant. Optimization of the HS-SPME parameters To achieve the highest extraction efficiency, the isolation procedure was optimized via the selection of an appropriate fiber, extraction temperature and extraction time by a univariate optimization design.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and octane are both mentioned as compounds analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) with specific ionization techniques. However, their relationship is limited to their presence in the same analytical procedure without any discussion of their chemical interactions, properties, or significance in relation to each other. They are simply part of a list of compounds analyzed for their peak areas in the MS measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and octane are only mentioned together in the context of mass spectrometry analysis without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
