    "context": "For the MS measurement, ionization was executed by electron impact (EI) at 70eV. Samples were analyzed by a full scan of MS from 40 to 500amu with a scanning speed of 0.28s. All of the peak areas were obtained with quantified ions. For example, m/z 91, m/z 98, m/z 81, m/z 70 and m/z 85 for toluene, cyclohexanone, heptanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and octane, respectively.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 package for Windows (USA). Significant differences between the two groups were obtained by Student's t-test or corrected t-test. A P value of<0.05 was considered as significant. Optimization of the HS-SPME parameters To achieve the highest extraction efficiency, the isolation procedure was optimized via the selection of an appropriate fiber, extraction temperature and extraction time by a univariate optimization design.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and cyclohexanone are both mentioned as compounds analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) for their peak areas at specific m/z values. However, there is no discussion of their chemical interactions, functional relationships, or significance beyond their inclusion in the same analytical procedure. They are simply part of a broader analysis of various compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and cyclohexanone are listed together in the context of mass spectrometry analysis without any direct interaction or detailed relationship discussed between them.",
