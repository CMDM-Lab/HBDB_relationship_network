    "context": "In particular, extremely high levels of cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were found in malignant pleural effusions, indicating they are suitable for differentiating malignant from benign effusions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that pleural effusion chosen as tested body fluid in our work is a valuable source for observation of VOMs changes. Further studies to validate whether these statistical significant VOMs (e.g. cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) are suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis of lung cancers are being conducted in other body fluids such as blood, urine and even saliva; results will be published elsewhere. The landfill represents the most common way of municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal. On the other hand, the anaerobic degradation of the biodegradable fraction of the landfilled MSW causes several environmental problems such as the production of methane and leachate, the emission of volatile organic compound (VOC) and odours, the presence of vectors \u2013 insects, rodents, and birds \u2013 public health hazard, explosions and plants toxicity. The strength of environmental impacts of MSW depends fundamentally on both the quantity and the characteristics of the organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and cyclohexanone are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in malignant pleural effusions, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for differentiating malignant from benign conditions. The study highlights their statistical significance in the context of lung cancer diagnosis, indicating a shared relevance in medical diagnostics, particularly in oncology.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and cyclohexanone, as both are highlighted as important VOCs in the context of lung cancer diagnostics. Their presence in malignant pleural effusions suggests a clear relationship with potential clinical implications, supported by statistical significance.",
