    "context": "Several parameters related to HS-SPME extraction efficiency (fiber coating, extraction temperature and extraction time) were optimized. The proposed method was applied to comparative analysis of VOMs in malignant effusions and benign effusions. At the same time, the peak areas of all volatile metabolites were submitted to statistical analysis to obtain the specific volatile metabolites that are able to differentiate lung cancer patients from inflammatory individuals. Chemicals and samples The standard compounds of methanol, acetone, toluene, hexanal, cyclohexanone, heptanal, phenol, decane, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, acetophenone, 1, 2, 4, 5-tetramethyl benzene, dodecane, 2-methylnaphthalene and 2, 6-di(tert)butyl-4-methylpnenol were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). The explored subjects were divided into two groups: malignant group (20 patients with lung cancer) and benign inflammatory group (20 benign inflammatory patients with pneumonia or tuberculous pleurisy). The malignant group was seventeen patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and three patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The benign inflammatory group was fifteen patients with tuberculous pleurisy and five patients with pneumonia, who had no history of cancer. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and decane are both mentioned as standard compounds used in the analysis of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs) in malignant and benign effusions. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction within the study. They are part of a broader list of chemicals analyzed for their potential to differentiate between lung cancer and inflammatory conditions, but their specific roles or interactions are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and decane are included in the same list of compounds used for analysis, indicating they belong to the same category of volatile organic compounds, but without any detailed interaction or functional relationship discussed.",
        "score": 2
