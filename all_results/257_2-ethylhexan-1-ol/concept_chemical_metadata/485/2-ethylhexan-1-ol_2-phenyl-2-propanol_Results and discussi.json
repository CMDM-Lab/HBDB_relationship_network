    "context": "Here, fold change is the ratio of average peak area of malignant effusions against benign effusions. The fold changes of the differential metabolites vary from 2.2 to 21.1. The larger fold change is, the more significant the difference of the average peak area between the two groups is. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 4, malignant effusion samples contain extremely higher levels of cyclohexanone, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 2-phenyl-2-propanol (fold change>14.0) than the benigns. The metabolites such as cyclohexanone, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene exhibit more significant difference (P \u22640.010) between the two groups than others. Among the 5 metabolites of interest, 3 compounds are likely to be from the exogenous sources such as diet or medication because all samples were collected from the same hospital. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and 2-phenyl-2-propanol are both identified as metabolites present in significantly higher levels in malignant effusions compared to benign effusions, with fold changes greater than 14.0. This suggests that both compounds may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing between malignant and benign conditions, indicating their relevance in the study of cancer diagnostics.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and 2-phenyl-2-propanol, as both are highlighted as differential metabolites with substantial fold changes in malignant effusions, indicating their potential role in cancer diagnostics.",
        "score": 4
