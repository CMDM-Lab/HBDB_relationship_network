    "context": "Several parameters related to HS-SPME extraction efficiency (fiber coating, extraction temperature and extraction time) were optimized. The proposed method was applied to comparative analysis of VOMs in malignant effusions and benign effusions. At the same time, the peak areas of all volatile metabolites were submitted to statistical analysis to obtain the specific volatile metabolites that are able to differentiate lung cancer patients from inflammatory individuals. Chemicals and samples The standard compounds of methanol, acetone, toluene, hexanal, cyclohexanone, heptanal, phenol, decane, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, acetophenone, 1, 2, 4, 5-tetramethyl benzene, dodecane, 2-methylnaphthalene and 2, 6-di(tert)butyl-4-methylpnenol were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). The explored subjects were divided into two groups: malignant group (20 patients with lung cancer) and benign inflammatory group (20 benign inflammatory patients with pneumonia or tuberculous pleurisy). The malignant group was seventeen patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and three patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The benign inflammatory group was fifteen patients with tuberculous pleurisy and five patients with pneumonia, who had no history of cancer. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and phenols are both mentioned as standard compounds analyzed in the study of volatile organic metabolites (VOMs) to differentiate between malignant and benign effusions in lung cancer patients. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction, as they are simply part of a broader analysis of various volatile compounds without specific emphasis on their comparative roles or effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are included in the analysis of VOMs, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction within the context provided.",
