    "context": "Here, ketones, alcohols and benzene derivatives are the three major chemical classes in the metabolomic profile of the malignant group, whereas in the benign group, ketones and benzene derivatives are the chemical classes that contributed most to the metabolomic profile. The average peak areas of ketones and alcohols are much higher in malignant effusions compared to benign ones, clearly showing their differences in relative abundances in the two groups of effusion samples. Together with phenols, they exhibit significant differences (P <0.05) between the two groups (see Table 3). The major metabolites of the chemical class of ketones and alcohols are acetone, cyclohexanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-phenyl-2-propanol, 4-(tert)butylcyclohexanol and 4-(iso)propylcyclohexanol. In addition, the peak areas of all 36 volatile metabolites between benign and malignant groups were also compared in detail. Statistical differences between two groups were obtained by Student's t-test. Of the 36 identified metabolites, 5 compounds exhibit significant differences (P <0.05) between the two groups, whereas the others show no any significant differences. Fig. 4 displays the comparison of average peak areas of the five statistically significant metabolites in benign and malignant groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is categorized as an alcohol, which, along with ketones, forms part of the metabolomic profile analyzed in malignant and benign effusions. The study highlights that both ketones and alcohols, including 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, show significant differences in their relative abundances between malignant and benign groups, indicating a potential role in distinguishing between these conditions. However, the specific interaction or functional relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and ketones is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as part of the same chemical profile.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is mentioned alongside ketones in the context of metabolomic profiling, indicating a shared significance in distinguishing between malignant and benign effusions, but without a detailed exploration of their direct relationship.",
