    "context": "The larger fold change is, the more significant the difference of the average peak area between the two groups is. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 4, malignant effusion samples contain extremely higher levels of cyclohexanone, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 2-phenyl-2-propanol (fold change>14.0) than the benigns. The metabolites such as cyclohexanone, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene exhibit more significant difference (P \u22640.010) between the two groups than others. Among the 5 metabolites of interest, 3 compounds are likely to be from the exogenous sources such as diet or medication because all samples were collected from the same hospital. For example, 2-phenyl-2-propanol is a metabolite of phenobarbital (a kind of anxiolytic drug). Longifolene is an important perfume, and its relative content is extremely low in both the groups. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the metabolites present in malignant effusion samples, showing a significant fold change compared to benign samples. This indicates that 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is likely involved in the metabolic processes associated with malignancy, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing between malignant and benign conditions. The relationship is underscored by the statistical significance of its concentration differences in the two groups.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and metabolites, as it is specifically mentioned as a metabolite with significant differences in concentration between malignant and benign samples, indicating its relevance in metabolic profiling.",
        "score": 4
