    "context": "For the MS measurement, ionization was executed by electron impact (EI) at 70eV. Samples were analyzed by a full scan of MS from 40 to 500amu with a scanning speed of 0.28s. All of the peak areas were obtained with quantified ions. For example, m/z 91, m/z 98, m/z 81, m/z 70 and m/z 85 for toluene, cyclohexanone, heptanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and octane, respectively.Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 package for Windows (USA). Significant differences between the two groups were obtained by Student's t-test or corrected t-test. A P value of<0.05 was considered as significant. Optimization of the HS-SPME parameters To achieve the highest extraction efficiency, the isolation procedure was optimized via the selection of an appropriate fiber, extraction temperature and extraction time by a univariate optimization design.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and toluene are both mentioned as compounds analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) with specific ionization techniques. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction beyond their inclusion in the analysis. They are part of a broader study on various compounds, but their specific roles or connections are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and toluene are listed together in the context of mass spectrometry analysis without any detailed interaction or functional relationship discussed between them.",
