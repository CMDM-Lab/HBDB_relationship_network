    "context": "In the metabolomic profiles, ketones, alcohols, benzene derivatives were the three major chemical classes of the malignant group, whereas ketones and benzene derivatives were the main chemical classes of the benign group. The chemical classes with dramatical difference between the two groups were ketones and alcohols. Together with phenols, they exhibit significant differences (P <0.05) between the two groups. Furthermore, among the 36 identified metabolites, 5 of which including cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were found to be significantly different (P <0.05) between the two groups by Students\u2019 t-test based on the peak areas of all identified metabolites. In particular, extremely high levels of cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were found in malignant pleural effusions, indicating they are suitable for differentiating malignant from benign effusions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that pleural effusion chosen as tested body fluid in our work is a valuable source for observation of VOMs changes. Further studies to validate whether these statistical significant VOMs (e.g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the metabolites that significantly differ between malignant and benign pleural effusions. The study highlights that among the 36 identified metabolites, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, along with cyclohexanone, shows a marked increase in malignant cases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for differentiating between the two types of effusions. This indicates a direct relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the broader category of metabolites analyzed in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and metabolites, as the study provides statistical evidence of its differential presence in malignant versus benign pleural effusions, indicating its relevance as a potential biomarker.",
