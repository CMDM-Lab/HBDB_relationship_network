    "context": "Significant differences between the two groups were obtained by Student's t-test or corrected t-test. A P value of<0.05 was considered as significant. Optimization of the HS-SPME parameters To achieve the highest extraction efficiency, the isolation procedure was optimized via the selection of an appropriate fiber, extraction temperature and extraction time by a univariate optimization design. Here, the standard test sample containing five major volatile compounds (toluene, cyclohexanone, heptanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and octane) detected in pleural effusions was used for optimization process owing to the amount limit of patient's pleural effusion samples. At first, three different SPME fibers (100\u03bcm PDMS, 65\u03bcm PDMS/DVB and 75\u03bcm CAR/PDMS) were used to extract the volatile compounds in the standard test sample with the extraction temperature at 50\u00b0C and the extraction time of 20min. Fig. 1(a) shows the results of the relative extraction efficiency for the tested fibers. As shown in Fig. 1(a), except that 2-ethyl-1-hexanol showed similar responses by using CAR/PDMS or PDMS/DVB, all other compounds obtained by the CAR/PDMS fiber exhibited the highest peak areas, whereas the PDMS fiber had the lowest efficiency.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the major volatile compounds analyzed during the optimization of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) parameters. The study focuses on extracting volatile substances from pleural effusions, indicating that 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is part of a broader category of volatile compounds being investigated for their extraction efficiency. However, the specific interactions or implications of 2-ethylhexan-1-ol within the group of volatile substances are not elaborated upon in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is included among volatile substances in the study, indicating a shared significance in the context of extraction efficiency. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of its specific role or interactions with other volatile compounds.",
