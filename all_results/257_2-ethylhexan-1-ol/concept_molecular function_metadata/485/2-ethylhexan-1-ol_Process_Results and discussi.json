    "context": "Significant differences between the two groups were obtained by Student's t-test or corrected t-test. A P value of<0.05 was considered as significant. Optimization of the HS-SPME parameters To achieve the highest extraction efficiency, the isolation procedure was optimized via the selection of an appropriate fiber, extraction temperature and extraction time by a univariate optimization design. Here, the standard test sample containing five major volatile compounds (toluene, cyclohexanone, heptanal, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and octane) detected in pleural effusions was used for optimization process owing to the amount limit of patient's pleural effusion samples. At first, three different SPME fibers (100\u03bcm PDMS, 65\u03bcm PDMS/DVB and 75\u03bcm CAR/PDMS) were used to extract the volatile compounds in the standard test sample with the extraction temperature at 50\u00b0C and the extraction time of 20min. Fig. 1(a) shows the results of the relative extraction efficiency for the tested fibers. As shown in Fig. 1(a), except that 2-ethyl-1-hexanol showed similar responses by using CAR/PDMS or PDMS/DVB, all other compounds obtained by the CAR/PDMS fiber exhibited the highest peak areas, whereas the PDMS fiber had the lowest efficiency.

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is one of the volatile compounds analyzed during the optimization of the headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) process. The study focuses on improving extraction efficiency by selecting appropriate fibers and conditions for isolating volatile compounds from pleural effusions. While 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is included in the optimization process, the relationship is primarily procedural rather than indicating a direct interaction or significance beyond its role in the extraction methodology.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is part of the optimization process for HS-SPME, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific role or significance in the broader context of the process.",
