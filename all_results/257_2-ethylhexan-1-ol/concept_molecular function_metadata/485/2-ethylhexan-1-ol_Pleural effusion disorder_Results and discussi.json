    "context": "Both were reported as the urinary biomarkers (total 9 compounds) of lung cancer by Hanai. Cyclohexanone are formed under metabolic conditions associated with a high oxidation rate of fatty acids as well as with a weight loss, which is one of the symptoms of advanced cancer. 2-Ethyl-1-hexanol was also reported in a significant increase in the headspace of cancerous cells as compared with medium controls and it could be released from the NCI-H2087 lung cancer cell lines. Based on above references reported and the present results, cyclohexanone and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol are considered as potential candidates for lung cancer biomarkers in differentiating malignant from benign pleural effusions. Further research is required to validate whether both compounds are suitable biomarkers for diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions. HS-SPME-GC/MS-based metabolomics has been applied to investigate low molecular weight VOMs in human pleural effusions. SPME combined with GC/MS is a simple, rapid, sensitive and solvent-free method for the determination of VOMs in pleural effusions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as a potential urinary biomarker for lung cancer, with its presence significantly increased in the headspace of cancerous cells compared to controls. The study suggests that it may help differentiate malignant from benign pleural effusions, indicating a potential diagnostic relevance in pleural effusion disorders related to lung cancer. However, further validation is needed to confirm its suitability as a biomarker.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and pleural effusion disorder, as the compound is proposed as a biomarker for lung cancer, which is directly related to pleural effusions. The context provides evidence for its potential role in diagnosis.",
