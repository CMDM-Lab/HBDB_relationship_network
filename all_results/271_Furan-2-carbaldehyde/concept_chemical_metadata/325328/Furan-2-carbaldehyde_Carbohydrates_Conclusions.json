    "context": "Among the most abundant compounds, 2-methoxyphenol is classified as Class I by Cramer rules (Cramer et al., 1978), which is the lowest level of toxicity. This compound is also permitted as flavoring for foodstuffs. Consequently, no risk of toxicity by exposure could be expected. The other abundant compound, furfural, is linked to carbohydrates degradation and has limited toxicity. Its concentration is considerably reduced during the processing, so that the expected concentration released to the atmosphere under normal use would be much lower. Atmospheric organic pollutants represent a major environmental and human health problem (Table 1 ) that was recently illustrated by evidence linking childhood cancers with prenatal or early postnatal exposure to atmospheric carcinogens (Knox, 2005a,b). Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are therefore strictly regulated (e.g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is indirectly related to carbohydrates through its association with the degradation of carbohydrates, as indicated by the mention of furfural, which is linked to carbohydrate breakdown. While Furan-2-carbaldehyde itself is not explicitly discussed, its connection to carbohydrate degradation suggests a potential relevance in the context of food processing and the formation of byproducts from carbohydrates.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and carbohydrates, as they share a general category related to the degradation processes. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or implications in the context provided.",
