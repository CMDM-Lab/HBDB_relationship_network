    "context": "Another option could be, as suggested by Yeh et al. (2009), to cover the composite with a thin layer of virgin polymer by co-extrusion process in order to delay or avoid the release of volatiles. Characterization and quantification of VOCs in WPC materials produced with LPDE or PE/EVA and different amounts of sawdust were evaluated by HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013MS. The profile of VOCs showed alkanes, alkenes, phenols, aldehydes, aromatic hydrocarbons, terpenes, carboxylic acids, esters, nitrogen compounds, ketones and alcohols. The most abundant compounds quantified were furfural, \u03b1-pinene, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-methoxyphenol, N-methylphthalimide, butylated hydroxytoluene, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol and diethyl phthalate. Injection molding process lowered about 2\u20134 times the concentration of furfural in WPC samples, and was able to remove completely 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and BHT. 2-Methoxyphenol and N-methylphthalimide were formed from thermal degradation of the sawdust during recycling process. WPC samples produced with additives showed higher concentration of 2,4-DBTP due to degradation of antioxidants. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde and diethyl phthalate are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in wood-plastic composite (WPC) materials. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed beyond their presence in the VOC profile. The context focuses on the characterization and quantification of various VOCs, including these two compounds, without detailing any specific interactions or functional connections between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as Furan-2-carbaldehyde and diethyl phthalate are both identified as VOCs in the same study, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship elaborated upon in the context.",
        "score": 2
