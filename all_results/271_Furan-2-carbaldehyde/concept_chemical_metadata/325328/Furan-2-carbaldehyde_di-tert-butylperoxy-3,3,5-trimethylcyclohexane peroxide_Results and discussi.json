    "context": "Twenty-four VOCs were quantified in 46 samples which included raw materials, LDPE and PE/EVA pellets, WPC pellets and WPC specimens. The chromatograms obtained from LDPE films, LDPE pellets and WPC pellets (LDPE+50% sawdust), highlighting the compounds quantified, are shown in the Fig. 3 . Table 3 shows the concentration range of each compound found between all evaluated samples. In general, the most abundant ones were furfural, \u03b1-pinene, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-methoxyphenol, N-methylphthalimide, BHT, 2,4-DTBP, and DEP. The highest furfural concentrations were observed in LDPE pellets (474\u03bcg/g) and in the WPC pellets with additives (67.1\u03bcg/g and 458\u03bcg/g \u2013 Table 1, samples 27 and 25, respectively). The injection procedure was able to reduce by almost 2\u20134 times the concentration of furfural (18.0\u03bcg/g and 199\u03bcg/g, in the samples 44 and 40, respectively, in Table 1). The LDPE films had a higher concentration of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (111\u03bcg/g) and in a LDPE film and LDPE pellets its concentration exceeded 116\u03bcg/g. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde and di-tert-butylperoxy-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane peroxide are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) quantified in various samples, including LDPE and WPC pellets. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions, functional relationships, or comparative significance within the study, indicating they are simply part of a broader analysis of VOCs without specific relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and di-tert-butylperoxy-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane peroxide, as they are only listed among other VOCs without any further context or interaction described.",
