    "context": "It should be pointed out that a high yield of cell mass on a carbonaceous substrate does not mean a high cell density in the culture because of the potential toxicity of the substrate at high concentrations. The initial concentration of aromatic compounds, for instance, should be controlled at 1\u20132g/L or below. Otherwise, no cell growth was observed. Although xylose and other pentoses are not good substrates of R. eutropha, their derivative furfural is a good substrate. Its concentration declines quickly from initial 1 to 2g/L to below 0.01g/L in 48h as shown in Fig. 3 . Since furfural is an aldehyde (furan-2-carboxaldehyde) derived mainly from xylose, R. eutropha may also be able to use other poor substrate sugars such as arabinose after they are converted to aldehydes. This needs further investigation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde (furfural) is discussed as a derivative of pentoses, particularly xylose, which is not a good substrate for R. eutropha. However, furfural is identified as a suitable substrate for this organism, indicating a metabolic pathway where pentoses can be converted into more usable forms like furfural. This suggests a relationship where pentoses serve as precursors for the production of Furan-2-carbaldehyde, which can then be utilized by R. eutropha for growth.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and pentoses, as the context discusses the conversion of pentoses into furfural, which is then used as a substrate by R. eutropha. This relationship is supported by the metabolic implications outlined in the text.",
