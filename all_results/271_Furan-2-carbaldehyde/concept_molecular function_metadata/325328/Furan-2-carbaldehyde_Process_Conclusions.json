    "context": "Characterization and quantification of VOCs in WPC materials produced with LPDE or PE/EVA and different amounts of sawdust were evaluated by HS-SPME\u2013GC\u2013MS. The profile of VOCs showed alkanes, alkenes, phenols, aldehydes, aromatic hydrocarbons, terpenes, carboxylic acids, esters, nitrogen compounds, ketones and alcohols. The most abundant compounds quantified were furfural, \u03b1-pinene, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, 2-methoxyphenol, N-methylphthalimide, butylated hydroxytoluene, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol and diethyl phthalate. Injection molding process lowered about 2\u20134 times the concentration of furfural in WPC samples, and was able to remove completely 2-ethyl-1-hexanol and BHT. 2-Methoxyphenol and N-methylphthalimide were formed from thermal degradation of the sawdust during recycling process. WPC samples produced with additives showed higher concentration of 2,4-DBTP due to degradation of antioxidants. WPC LDPE industrial prototype was investigated by GC\u2013MS/O and showed a characteristic burnt, sweet and wax-like odor. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) characterized in wood-plastic composite (WPC) materials. The injection molding process significantly reduced the concentration of Furan-2-carbaldehyde in the samples, indicating a direct relationship between the processing method and the levels of this compound. The process also influenced the formation and degradation of other compounds, highlighting its role in VOC management during WPC production.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and the injection molding process, as the process directly affects its concentration in WPC materials. The evidence provided indicates a clear relationship, although the context does not delve into the specific mechanisms of this interaction.",
