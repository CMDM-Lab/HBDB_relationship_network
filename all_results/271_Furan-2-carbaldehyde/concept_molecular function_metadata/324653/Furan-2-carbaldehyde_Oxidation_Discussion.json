    "context": "This may explain why a tolerant strain can have an almost normal microbial activity in hydrolysate solution. R. eutropha exhibits strong biological oxidation of aromatic and phenolic compounds such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) (Louie et al., 2002). The corresponding genes are clustered on cell\u2019s chromosome, forming a putative catabolic operon (Matus et al., 2003). For O-heterocyclic compounds like furfural, its oxidation into carboxylic acid is carried out by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (Zarnt et al., 1995). The tolerant cells may already have high activities of those responsible enzymes and can immediately work on biodegradation of the inhibitors. The cells, therefore, effectively reduce and control the intracellular concentrations of organic inhibitors, and finally remove all the inhibitors from the solution. The normal strain cells, however, may not express the operons quickly and have very low activities of those responsible enzymes. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as an O-heterocyclic compound that undergoes oxidation to form carboxylic acid, facilitated by aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes. This process highlights the role of oxidation in the biodegradation of organic inhibitors, suggesting a direct relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and oxidation in microbial activity and catabolic pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and oxidation, as the context discusses the specific enzymatic oxidation process that transforms Furan-2-carbaldehyde into a carboxylic acid, indicating a clear biochemical relationship.",
