    "context": "[7] Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlERF2 overexpression lines exhibited premature germination, further implicating ERF genes in promoting germination . [8] An interaction between an ERF transcription factor and GA3ox1 expression was recently suggested to be involved in the regulation of tomato seed germination (; ). [9] It was proposed that, in tomato seeds, GA biosynthesis first occurs to promote growth in the embryonic radicle/hypocotyl, which exerts mechanical pressure on the adjacent endosperm cap to stimulate ethylene-related wounding responses that lead to the induction of the ERF1 gene, which, in turn, promotes endosperm cap-specific genes that weaken the cap tissue to allow radicle emergence. [1] Previous studies showed that ethylene induces endosperm weakening for radicle protrusion in association with the activation of EBM (, ; ). [2] Here, we observed essentially parallel expression of LsERF1 and LsMAN1 in lettuce seeds. [3] The rapid response of LsMAN1 expression during the first 6 h after ethylene exposure in seeds having PI alleles at Htg9.1 is consistent with the high levels of EBM activity detected during early phases of lettuce seed germination , as also occurs in tomato (; ). [4] The presence of ERELEE4 in the LsMAN1 promoter indicates that its expression may be controlled by LsERF1. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, specifically in promoting the weakening of the endosperm cap to facilitate radicle protrusion. Ethylene's role in inducing endosperm weakening is crucial for allowing the radicle to emerge, highlighting a direct relationship between ethylene signaling and the mechanical process of protrusion during germination.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and protrusion, as ethylene is directly involved in the biological process that enables radicle protrusion by weakening the endosperm cap, supported by evidence from previous studies.",
