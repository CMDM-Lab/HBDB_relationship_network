    "context": "[3] Ethylene production is regulated by both ACS activity that modulates ACC availability and ACO enzymatic activity that converts ACC to ethylene . [4] Application of ethylene can alleviate the inhibitory effect of high temperature on lettuce seed germination (; ) and of secondary dormancy in sunflower seeds , and ethylene production rates of lettuce seeds are reduced by high temperatures during imbibition (; ). [5] The mechanism by which ethylene acts in promoting thermotolerance in lettuce seeds is not fully understood. [6] Some studies have found an increase in the activity of a cell wall-remodeling enzyme, endo-\u00ce\u00b2-mannanase (EBM), in parallel with the increase in ethylene production rates in thermotolerant lettuce genotypes during germination at high temperature (; , , ), suggesting a direct stimulatory effect of ethylene action on the enzymatic activity associated with weakening the lettuce endosperm and enabling radicle protrusion. [7] Other studies have suggested that ethylene promotes embryonic cell expansion associated with radicle emergence (; ). [1] Ethylene may also promote germination indirectly through interactions with GA and ABA. [2] GA can promote the expression of ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, while inhibition of ethylene synthesis can reduce the expression of GA biosynthetic enzymes (; , ; ; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the process of radicle protrusion during seed germination, particularly in thermotolerant lettuce genotypes. Ethylene production is associated with increased activity of cell wall-remodeling enzymes, such as endo-\u03b2-mannanase, which facilitate the weakening of the lettuce endosperm, thereby enabling the radicle to protrude. This suggests a direct stimulatory effect of ethylene on the mechanisms that promote seed germination and radicle emergence.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and protrusion, as the context provides evidence of ethylene's role in enhancing enzymatic activity that directly facilitates radicle protrusion during germination. The relationship is supported by specific enzymatic interactions and physiological processes.",
