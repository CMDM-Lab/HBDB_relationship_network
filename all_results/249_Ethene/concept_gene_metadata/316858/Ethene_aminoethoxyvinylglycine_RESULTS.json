    "context": "[15] In C and F, seeds of PI and NIL-PI were imbibed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C, and Sal and NIL-Sal seeds were imbibed at 28\u00c2\u00b0C. [16] Error bars indicate se (n = 4). [1] The temperature of imbibition can affect ethylene biosynthesis (; ), possibly confounding responses to ethylene application. [2] To determine the ethylene sensitivity of germination in the absence of endogenous ethylene synthesis, germination assays at different ethylene concentrations were conducted in the presence of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), which reduces ethylene production by inhibiting ACS enzymatic activity . [3] The optimal conditions for AVG inhibitory action on Sal and PI seed germination were identified through assays of the parental seeds across a range of temperatures compared with water-imbibed seeds. [4] Increasing concentrations of AVG progressively lowered maximum germination temperatures for seeds of both genotypes (Supplemental Fig. S6). [5] The maximum germination difference between control and AVG-treated (10 mm) seeds was observed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C for PI and 29\u00c2\u00b0C for Sal seeds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) are related through their roles in seed germination and ethylene biosynthesis. AVG is used to inhibit the production of ethylene by blocking the activity of the enzyme ACS, which is crucial for ethylene synthesis. The study investigates how varying concentrations of AVG affect germination temperatures in seeds, indicating a direct interaction where AVG modulates the effects of ethylene on seed germination.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and AVG, as AVG directly influences ethylene production and its effects on seed germination. The context provides evidence of this relationship through experimental results, highlighting the importance of AVG in regulating ethylene's role in plant physiology.",
