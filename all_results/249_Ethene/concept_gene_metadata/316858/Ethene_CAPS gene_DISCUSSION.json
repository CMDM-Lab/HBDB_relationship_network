    "context": "[6] Suppression of the expression of Arabidopsis ERFs through histone deacetylation also inhibits germination . [7] Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlERF2 overexpression lines exhibited premature germination, further implicating ERF genes in promoting germination . [8] An interaction between an ERF transcription factor and GA3ox1 expression was recently suggested to be involved in the regulation of tomato seed germination (; ). [9] It was proposed that, in tomato seeds, GA biosynthesis first occurs to promote growth in the embryonic radicle/hypocotyl, which exerts mechanical pressure on the adjacent endosperm cap to stimulate ethylene-related wounding responses that lead to the induction of the ERF1 gene, which, in turn, promotes endosperm cap-specific genes that weaken the cap tissue to allow radicle emergence. [1] Previous studies showed that ethylene induces endosperm weakening for radicle protrusion in association with the activation of EBM (, ; ). [2] Here, we observed essentially parallel expression of LsERF1 and LsMAN1 in lettuce seeds. [3] The rapid response of LsMAN1 expression during the first 6 h after ethylene exposure in seeds having PI alleles at Htg9.1 is consistent with the high levels of EBM activity detected during early phases of lettuce seed germination , as also occurs in tomato (; ).

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, where it induces endosperm weakening to facilitate radicle emergence. The CAPS gene, while not directly mentioned, is part of the broader genetic framework involved in the regulation of germination processes. Ethylene's role in promoting the expression of genes related to endosperm cap weakening suggests a potential indirect relationship with the CAPS gene, which may be involved in similar regulatory pathways during germination.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethene is linked to the germination process and gene expression, while the CAPS gene is part of the genetic regulation of this process. However, the direct interaction between ethene and the CAPS gene is not explicitly detailed.",
