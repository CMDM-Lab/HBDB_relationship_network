    "context": "[11] The expression of LsACS1, LsACO1, and LsGA3ox1 genes was most responsive to ethylene, with approximately 20-fold increases compared with seeds in AVG without ethylene exposure (Figs. 5, A, B, E, and F, and 6, A and E). [12] In contrast, LsERF104 expression was unaffected by the treatments, remained high in all conditions, and was not correlated with germination behavior (Fig. 6, D, H, and L). [13] The expression levels of dormancy-associated genes (LsGA2ox2 and LsNCED4) were equal to or higher in AVG-imbibed PI and NIL-PI seeds than in water-imbibed seeds at 6 and 12 h of imbibition and decreased when seeds were exposed to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene (Fig. 6, B, C, F, and G). [14] Thus, exposure to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene was clearly related to increases in germination-associated gene expression and decreases in dormancy-associated gene expression in these genotypes, consistent with the induction of germination by this ethylene concentration in seeds carrying the PI allele at Htg9.1. [1] Expression of genes associated with the putative candidate gene of Htg9.1 (LsERF1) and ethylene biosynthesis and signaling pathways in seeds of PI at 32\u00c2\u00b0C (A\u00e2\u20ac\u201cD), NIL-PI at 32\u00c2\u00b0C (E\u00e2\u20ac\u201cH), and Sal at 29\u00c2\u00b0C (I\u00e2\u20ac\u201cL) in various conditions (bars from left): water after 6 h of imbibition; water after 12 h of imbibition; 10 mm AVG after 6 h of imbibition; 10 mm AVG after 12 h of imbibition; 10 mm AVG after 24 h of imbibition; or 24 h in 10 mm AVG before being exposed to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene for 6 or 12 h. [2] Results are shown for (from left) LsACO1, LsACS1, LsERF1, and LsMAN1. [3] Error bars indicate se (n = 3 biological replicates). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to the expression of specific genes associated with germination in seeds, particularly those carrying the PI allele at Htg9.1. The study indicates that exposure to ethylene significantly influences the expression of germination-associated genes while reducing dormancy-associated gene expression. This suggests that the presence of certain alleles may affect how seeds respond to ethylene, highlighting a genetic component in the physiological response to this plant hormone.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and alleles, as the context discusses how ethylene exposure impacts gene expression related to germination, specifically in seeds with the PI allele. This relationship is supported by evidence of gene expression changes in response to ethylene.",
