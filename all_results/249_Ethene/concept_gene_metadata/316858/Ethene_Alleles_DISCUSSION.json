    "context": " [1] GA and ethylene have been described as acting independently to interfere with ABA inhibitory action for dormancy release (; ).  [2] This study suggests that, in lettuce, there is a concerted action of ethylene and GA to overcome the inhibitory effect of ABA and promote thermotolerance in seeds having PI alleles at Htg9.1 (Fig. 7).  [3] The ability of ethylene to stimulate both Sal and PI seeds to germinate even in the presence of ABA at their germination-permissive temperatures could be due to ethylene altering the GA and ABA hormonal balance to favor GA (Fig. 7).  [4] The opposite patterns of transcript abundances of LsNCED4 and LsGA2ox2 versus LsGA3ox1 in seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1 emphasize the close relationship between ethylene and GA in suppressing ABA inhibitory action.  [5] The inability of ethylene to overcome the PAC inhibition of GA synthesis to promote germination indicates that GA acts downstream of the ethylene-signaling pathway.  [6] Our genetic, physiological, and gene expression data support a model in which ethylene promotes GA biosynthesis through LsERF1, thereby reducing the effectiveness of ABA in blocking germination at high temperature (Fig. 7).  [7] Based on promoter motifs, it is also possible that LsERF1 might directly promote endosperm cap weakening by stimulating the expression of LsMAN1. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to the action of GA (gibberellins) in promoting seed germination and thermotolerance, particularly in seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1. The study indicates that ethylene and GA work together to counteract the inhibitory effects of ABA (abscisic acid) on germination. The relationship highlights the genetic influence of alleles on the physiological response to ethylene, suggesting that specific alleles can affect how seeds respond to hormonal signals during germination.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and alleles, as the study provides evidence of how specific alleles influence the interaction between ethylene and GA in overcoming ABA inhibition, indicating a clear relationship within the context of seed physiology.",
