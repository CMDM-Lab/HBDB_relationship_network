    "context": "[1] Identifying additional genes and regulatory pathways associated with genetic variation in the temperature sensitivity of germination could clarify the roles of hormones in regulating seed dormancy. [2] Therefore, we studied the basis of thermotolerance in a primitive accession of lettuce, PI251246 (PI), that exhibits tolerance of high temperature during germination (33\u00c2\u00b0C or less; ). [3] Analysis of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from a cross between PI and Sal  identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with the high-temperature germination (HTG) trait . [4] Here, we report further genetic and transcriptomic data that strongly support a role for ethylene signaling, and specifically of a lettuce homolog of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (LsERF1), in the thermotolerance of PI seeds during high-temperature imbibition. [5] Supporting physiological studies indicate that ethylene and LsERF1 may act through the promotion of GA biosynthesis. [6] These results expand upon prior knowledge of the hormonal basis of seed dormancy and connect ethylene action with GA biosynthesis to counter the inhibitory effect of ABA in regulating the sensitivity of lettuce seed germination to elevated temperatures. [1] Screening seed germination of the parental Sal and PI lines across a range of temperatures revealed significant differences in their sensitivities to inhibition. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene is linked to the thermotolerance of lettuce seeds during high-temperature germination, with a specific focus on a homologous gene, LsERF1, which is associated with ethylene signaling. The study suggests that LsERF1 plays a crucial role in promoting gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, thereby counteracting the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on seed germination. This indicates a significant relationship between ethylene signaling and the expression of the homologous gene in regulating seed dormancy and germination under temperature stress.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between ethylene and the homologous gene LsERF1, supported by genetic and physiological data indicating their roles in seed thermotolerance. The evidence suggests a clear interaction in the context of hormonal regulation during germination.",
