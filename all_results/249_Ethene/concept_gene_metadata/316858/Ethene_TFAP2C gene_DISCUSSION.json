    "context": "[6] Suppression of the expression of Arabidopsis ERFs through histone deacetylation also inhibits germination . [7] Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) SlERF2 overexpression lines exhibited premature germination, further implicating ERF genes in promoting germination . [8] An interaction between an ERF transcription factor and GA3ox1 expression was recently suggested to be involved in the regulation of tomato seed germination (; ). [9] It was proposed that, in tomato seeds, GA biosynthesis first occurs to promote growth in the embryonic radicle/hypocotyl, which exerts mechanical pressure on the adjacent endosperm cap to stimulate ethylene-related wounding responses that lead to the induction of the ERF1 gene, which, in turn, promotes endosperm cap-specific genes that weaken the cap tissue to allow radicle emergence. [1] Previous studies showed that ethylene induces endosperm weakening for radicle protrusion in association with the activation of EBM (, ; ). [2] Here, we observed essentially parallel expression of LsERF1 and LsMAN1 in lettuce seeds. [3] The rapid response of LsMAN1 expression during the first 6 h after ethylene exposure in seeds having PI alleles at Htg9.1 is consistent with the high levels of EBM activity detected during early phases of lettuce seed germination , as also occurs in tomato (; ).

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, where it induces endosperm weakening to facilitate radicle protrusion. The TFAP2C gene, while not directly mentioned, is part of the broader regulatory network involving ERF transcription factors that respond to ethylene signaling. This suggests a potential indirect relationship where ethylene influences the expression of genes like TFAP2C in the context of seed germination, although the specific role of TFAP2C is not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethene is involved in the germination process and may influence the expression of the TFAP2C gene through ethylene signaling pathways, but the direct relationship is not explicitly established in the context.",
        "score": 3
