    "context": "[10] Seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1 continue to be inhibited at high temperatures even in the presence of FLU, indicating their greater dependence upon ethylene compared with seeds having Sal alleles at that locus.  [1] GA and ethylene have been described as acting independently to interfere with ABA inhibitory action for dormancy release (; ).  [2] This study suggests that, in lettuce, there is a concerted action of ethylene and GA to overcome the inhibitory effect of ABA and promote thermotolerance in seeds having PI alleles at Htg9.1 (Fig. 7).  [3] The ability of ethylene to stimulate both Sal and PI seeds to germinate even in the presence of ABA at their germination-permissive temperatures could be due to ethylene altering the GA and ABA hormonal balance to favor GA (Fig. 7).  [4] The opposite patterns of transcript abundances of LsNCED4 and LsGA2ox2 versus LsGA3ox1 in seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1 emphasize the close relationship between ethylene and GA in suppressing ABA inhibitory action.  [5] The inability of ethylene to overcome the PAC inhibition of GA synthesis to promote germination indicates that GA acts downstream of the ethylene-signaling pathway.  [6] Our genetic, physiological, and gene expression data support a model in which ethylene promotes GA biosynthesis through LsERF1, thereby reducing the effectiveness of ABA in blocking germination at high temperature (Fig. 7).

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene (term_A) plays a crucial role in promoting germination and thermotolerance in seeds, particularly those with PI alleles at Htg9.1. Ethylene's interaction with gibberellins (GA) helps to overcome the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA), indicating its permissive biological function in seed germination. The study highlights how ethylene alters hormonal balances to favor GA, thus facilitating germination under high-temperature conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and its biological function in promoting seed germination by modulating hormonal interactions. The context provides evidence of ethylene's role in overcoming ABA inhibition, demonstrating its importance in plant physiology.",
