    "context": "[6] The inhibitory effect of AVG on ethylene production was observed within 24 h of the initial imbibition. [7] Overall, when imbibed with water for 72 h, PI and NIL-PI seeds had the highest total ethylene production at 2,310 and 1,860 \u00c2\u00b5L mg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 at 32\u00c2\u00b0C, while Sal and NIL-Sal seeds produced less than half as much ethylene at their germination temperature threshold (29\u00c2\u00b0C), 900 and 815 \u00c2\u00b5L mg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, respectively (Supplemental Table S6). [8] However, when imbibed with 10 mm AVG, the total ethylene production for all genotypes was reduced to approximately 200 \u00c2\u00b5L mg\u00e2\u02c6\u20191, similar to that for water-imbibed seeds at thermoinhibitory temperatures (Supplemental Table S6). [1] These tests showed that AVG-treated seeds of all genotypes would have similar low levels of endogenous ethylene production prior to being exposed to different concentrations of exogenous ethylene to test their sensitivity to ethylene perception and signaling. [2] When exposed to different ethylene concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) after pretreatment with 10 mm AVG for 24 h, both PI and NIL-PI seeds were able to germinate in the presence of 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene at 32\u00c2\u00b0C (Fig. 4B). [3] In contrast, no germination was observed in Sal and NIL-Sal seeds that were exposed to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene at 29\u00c2\u00b0C, and 10 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene was required to recover full germination (Fig. 4B). [4] Germination recovery of NIL-PI seeds was intermediate, with 50% germination at 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene and 83% germination at 10 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene.

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to signal transduction through its role in regulating seed germination. The study examines how ethylene production, influenced by AVG treatment, affects the sensitivity of different seed genotypes to ethylene concentrations. This indicates that ethylene acts as a signaling molecule, triggering germination processes in response to environmental cues.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and signal transduction, as ethylene is shown to play a crucial role in the signaling pathways that regulate seed germination, supported by experimental data on ethylene sensitivity in various seed genotypes.",
