    "context": "[1] While ABA is well known to be involved in regulating seed dormancy , ethylene has long been associated with seed dormancy release in species of the Compositae family, including lettuce and sunflower (Helianthus annuus; ; ; ). [2] The ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants begins with the conversion of S-adenosyl-Met to 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACC) via ACC synthase (ACS), followed by conversion of the ACC precursor to ethylene via ACC oxidase (ACO; ). [3] Ethylene production is regulated by both ACS activity that modulates ACC availability and ACO enzymatic activity that converts ACC to ethylene . [4] Application of ethylene can alleviate the inhibitory effect of high temperature on lettuce seed germination (; ) and of secondary dormancy in sunflower seeds , and ethylene production rates of lettuce seeds are reduced by high temperatures during imbibition (; ). [5] The mechanism by which ethylene acts in promoting thermotolerance in lettuce seeds is not fully understood. [6] Some studies have found an increase in the activity of a cell wall-remodeling enzyme, endo-\u00ce\u00b2-mannanase (EBM), in parallel with the increase in ethylene production rates in thermotolerant lettuce genotypes during germination at high temperature (; , , ), suggesting a direct stimulatory effect of ethylene action on the enzymatic activity associated with weakening the lettuce endosperm and enabling radicle protrusion. [7] Other studies have suggested that ethylene promotes embryonic cell expansion associated with radicle emergence (; ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene (term_A) is linked to the regulation of seed dormancy (term_B) in plants, particularly in the Compositae family. Ethylene is associated with the release of dormancy in seeds, such as lettuce and sunflower, by alleviating inhibitory effects on germination. The production of ethylene is influenced by environmental factors, and its role in promoting seed germination and overcoming dormancy is highlighted through its interaction with enzymatic activities that facilitate radicle protrusion.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and seed dormancy, supported by evidence of ethylene's role in promoting germination and its regulatory effects on dormancy in specific plant species. The context provides a clear relationship with functional implications.",
