    "context": "[2] GA can promote the expression of ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, while inhibition of ethylene synthesis can reduce the expression of GA biosynthetic enzymes (; , ; ; ). [3] In lettuce seeds, genes encoding ethylene and GA biosynthetic enzymes were largely regulated coordinately, with their transcripts rising or falling in parallel in response to imbibition temperature or other manipulations of germination potential . [4] Thus, ethylene could promote GA biosynthesis or action, enabling germination at higher temperatures. [5] Alternatively, several studies have reported that ethylene can reduce the synthesis of ABA, enhance its degradation, or alter sensitivity to its action (; ; ; ; ; ), indicating that ethylene may promote germination by acting as a negative regulator of ABA synthesis or action (; ). [1] Identifying additional genes and regulatory pathways associated with genetic variation in the temperature sensitivity of germination could clarify the roles of hormones in regulating seed dormancy. [2] Therefore, we studied the basis of thermotolerance in a primitive accession of lettuce, PI251246 (PI), that exhibits tolerance of high temperature during germination (33\u00c2\u00b0C or less; ). [3] Analysis of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from a cross between PI and Sal  identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with the high-temperature germination (HTG) trait .

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is discussed in relation to its role in promoting the expression of biosynthetic enzymes for gibberellins (GA) and its interaction with abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination. Ethene's influence on the synthesis of these hormones suggests a regulatory role in the synthesis pathways that facilitate germination under varying temperature conditions. The coordinated regulation of ethylene and GA biosynthetic enzymes indicates a significant relationship between ethene and the synthesis of these hormones, particularly in the context of seed dormancy and germination.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and synthesis, as ethene is shown to promote the expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of gibberellins, indicating a clear regulatory role in hormone synthesis related to seed germination.",
        "score": 4
