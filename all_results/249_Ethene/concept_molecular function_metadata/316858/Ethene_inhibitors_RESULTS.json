    "context": "[5] This result demonstrates that seeds with the PI allele of Htg9.1 are more dependent upon ethylene biosynthesis for germination at high temperature than are seeds with the Sal allele. [1] GA is well known to be required for seed germination , so the effect of blocking GA biosynthesis using the inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC) on the germination of lettuce genotypes was tested at their maximum threshold temperatures allowing germination. [2] At 100 \u00c2\u00b5m and higher PAC, both PI and Sal seeds were not able to germinate at their respective germination-permissive temperatures (Supplemental Fig. S9). [3] The inhibitory action of 100 \u00c2\u00b5m PAC on germination could not be reversed with 10 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene for Sal and NIL-Sal seeds at 28\u00c2\u00b0C or for PI and NIL-PI seeds at 32\u00c2\u00b0C (Fig. 4F). [4] However, germination could be fully restored with the addition of 100 \u00c2\u00b5m GA4 solution following the ethylene exposure, indicating no nonspecific effect of PAC on germination (Fig. 4F). [5] This result provides evidence that the gene responsible for the ability of Htg9.1 to increase maximum germination temperature acts upstream of or in conjunction with GA.  [1] Gene expression (mRNA abundance) assays were performed to assess the effects of exogenous ethylene on the expression of LsERF1 and other genes controlling biosynthetic and regulatory processes essential for seed germination and dormancy.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene (term_A) is discussed in relation to its role in seed germination, particularly under high-temperature conditions. The use of inhibitors, specifically paclobutrazol (PAC), demonstrates that blocking gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis affects germination. The results indicate that ethylene's action cannot reverse the inhibitory effects of PAC, suggesting that ethylene and inhibitors interact in a complex manner during the germination process, with ethylene being essential for germination under certain conditions, while inhibitors can block this process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and inhibitors, as the context provides evidence of their interaction in seed germination. The specific mention of PAC as an inhibitor affecting ethylene's role in germination supports this relationship, indicating a clear functional connection.",
