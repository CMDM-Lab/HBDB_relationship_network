    "context": "[15] In C and F, seeds of PI and NIL-PI were imbibed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C, and Sal and NIL-Sal seeds were imbibed at 28\u00c2\u00b0C. [16] Error bars indicate se (n = 4). [1] The temperature of imbibition can affect ethylene biosynthesis (; ), possibly confounding responses to ethylene application. [2] To determine the ethylene sensitivity of germination in the absence of endogenous ethylene synthesis, germination assays at different ethylene concentrations were conducted in the presence of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), which reduces ethylene production by inhibiting ACS enzymatic activity . [3] The optimal conditions for AVG inhibitory action on Sal and PI seed germination were identified through assays of the parental seeds across a range of temperatures compared with water-imbibed seeds. [4] Increasing concentrations of AVG progressively lowered maximum germination temperatures for seeds of both genotypes (Supplemental Fig. S6). [5] The maximum germination difference between control and AVG-treated (10 mm) seeds was observed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C for PI and 29\u00c2\u00b0C for Sal seeds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is indirectly related to the synthesis process as it is involved in ethylene biosynthesis, which is crucial for seed germination. The study examines how temperature affects ethylene production and its subsequent impact on germination, indicating that ethylene synthesis is a key factor in the germination process. However, the specific synthesis of ethene itself is not the primary focus of the discussion.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethene is linked to the synthesis of ethylene, which plays a significant role in seed germination. The context discusses the effects of ethylene on germination, but does not delve deeply into the synthesis of ethene itself.",
