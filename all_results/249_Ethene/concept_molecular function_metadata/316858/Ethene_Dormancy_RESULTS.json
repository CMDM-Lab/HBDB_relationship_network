    "context": "[3] Exposure of AVG-treated Sal seeds to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene for 6 h induced slight increases in the expression of all germination-promoting genes except LsGA3ox1, but expression did not increase further at 12 h. [4] Failure of ethylene to induce greater or sustained expression of these genes is consistent with a lack of germination of these seeds in response to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene (Fig. 4B). [5] An opposite pattern was observed with dormancy-associated genes such as LsGA2ox2 and LsNCED4, whose expression was higher in AVG-imbibed compared with water-imbibed Sal seeds and remained high or increased over time (Fig. 6, J and K). [6] Exposure to 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene for 12 h wholly (LsGA2ox2) or partially (LsNCED4) reversed the effect of AVG on Sal seeds for genes associated with dormancy (Fig. 6, J and K). [7] Thus, these patterns of gene expression are consistent with the effects of AVG and ethylene on germination. [8] LsERF104 expression in Sal seeds resembled that in the thermotolerant genotypes, exhibiting high expression across all conditions without any correlation to germination behavior. [1] Given their consistent expression patterns in response to AVG and ethylene, the promoter regions of LsACS1, LsACO1, LsMAN1, and LsGA3ox1 genes were examined for potential transcription factor binding sites based on cis-element prediction using PLACE software (Supplemental Table S8).

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to the regulation of dormancy in Sal seeds through its influence on gene expression. Exposure to ethylene affects germination-promoting genes and dormancy-associated genes differently. While ethylene exposure did not enhance germination, it reversed the effects of AVG on dormancy-related genes, indicating a complex relationship where ethylene plays a role in breaking dormancy but does not directly promote germination under certain conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and dormancy, as the context discusses how ethylene influences the expression of genes related to dormancy and germination. The evidence provided indicates a clear relationship, although the exact mechanisms remain partially understood.",
