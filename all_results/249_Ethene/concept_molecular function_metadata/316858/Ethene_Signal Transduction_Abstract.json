    "context": "[1] Identifying additional genes and regulatory pathways associated with genetic variation in the temperature sensitivity of germination could clarify the roles of hormones in regulating seed dormancy. [2] Therefore, we studied the basis of thermotolerance in a primitive accession of lettuce, PI251246 (PI), that exhibits tolerance of high temperature during germination (33\u00c2\u00b0C or less; ). [3] Analysis of a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from a cross between PI and Sal  identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with the high-temperature germination (HTG) trait . [4] Here, we report further genetic and transcriptomic data that strongly support a role for ethylene signaling, and specifically of a lettuce homolog of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (LsERF1), in the thermotolerance of PI seeds during high-temperature imbibition. [5] Supporting physiological studies indicate that ethylene and LsERF1 may act through the promotion of GA biosynthesis. [6] These results expand upon prior knowledge of the hormonal basis of seed dormancy and connect ethylene action with GA biosynthesis to counter the inhibitory effect of ABA in regulating the sensitivity of lettuce seed germination to elevated temperatures. [1] Screening seed germination of the parental Sal and PI lines across a range of temperatures revealed significant differences in their sensitivities to inhibition. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene (ethylene) is linked to signal transduction through its role in regulating seed germination and thermotolerance in lettuce. The study highlights the involvement of ethylene signaling, particularly the lettuce homolog of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (LsERF1), in promoting gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, which counteracts the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) during high-temperature conditions. This connection illustrates how ethylene acts as a signaling molecule that influences physiological responses in plants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethene and signal transduction, as the context provides evidence of ethylene's role in signaling pathways that regulate seed germination and thermotolerance, supported by genetic and physiological data.",
