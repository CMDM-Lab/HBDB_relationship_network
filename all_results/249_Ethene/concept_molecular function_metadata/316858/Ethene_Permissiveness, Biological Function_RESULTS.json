    "context": " [3] Consistent with prior germination assays, AVG-treated seeds of all genotypes failed to germinate at their corresponding germination temperature thresholds, and 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene could promote germination recovery only in PI and NIL-PI seeds but not in Sal seeds (Fig. 4B).  [4] Thus, the expression of germination-associated genes LsERF1, LsACS1, LsACO1, LsGA3ox1 (GA 3-OXIDASE1; GA biosynthesis), and LsMAN1 (ENDO-\u00ce\u00b2-MANNANASE1; germination-associated cell wall modification) and dormancy-promoting genes LsGA2ox2 (GA inactivation) and LsNCED4 was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in seeds imbibed in water, AVG, or AVG plus 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene.  [5] In addition, LsERF104, an ERF-like gene also found on scaffold 243, was assayed to test whether the expression of LsERF1 was unique across temperatures and genotypes.  [6] Expression patterns of these genes were similar in PI and NIL-PI seeds in all conditions (water, 10 mm AVG, and 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene) when imbibed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C, their maximum permissive temperature for germination (Figs. 5, A\u00e2\u20ac\u201cF and E\u00e2\u20ac\u201cH, and 6, A\u00e2\u20ac\u201cD and E\u00e2\u20ac\u201cH), confirming that it is the introgressed genomic region from PI that is controlling the responses of gene expression to temperature.  [7] Germination-associated genes (LsACS1, LsACO1, LsERF1, LsMAN1, and LsGA3ox1) all had high or increasing transcript levels at 6 and 12 h of imbibition in water.  [8] However, the presence of 10 mm AVG significantly lowered the expression levels of these germination-promoting genes in PI and NIL-PI seeds compared with water-imbibed seeds.  [9] The lower expression level in AVG-treated seeds was maintained until 24 h of imbibition. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the biological function of seed germination, particularly in its role as a promoter of germination recovery in specific genotypes. The permissiveness of germination is influenced by temperature and the expression of germination-associated genes, which are regulated by ethylene. The study indicates that ethylene's presence can enhance the expression of genes necessary for germination, suggesting a critical biological function in overcoming dormancy and facilitating seed germination under optimal conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and its biological function in promoting seed germination, supported by evidence of gene expression changes in response to ethylene treatment. The context highlights the importance of ethylene in regulating germination processes, indicating a strong relationship.",
