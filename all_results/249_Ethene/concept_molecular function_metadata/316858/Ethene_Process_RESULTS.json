    "context": "[3] The inhibitory action of 100 \u00c2\u00b5m PAC on germination could not be reversed with 10 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene for Sal and NIL-Sal seeds at 28\u00c2\u00b0C or for PI and NIL-PI seeds at 32\u00c2\u00b0C (Fig. 4F). [4] However, germination could be fully restored with the addition of 100 \u00c2\u00b5m GA4 solution following the ethylene exposure, indicating no nonspecific effect of PAC on germination (Fig. 4F). [5] This result provides evidence that the gene responsible for the ability of Htg9.1 to increase maximum germination temperature acts upstream of or in conjunction with GA.  [1] Gene expression (mRNA abundance) assays were performed to assess the effects of exogenous ethylene on the expression of LsERF1 and other genes controlling biosynthetic and regulatory processes essential for seed germination and dormancy.  [2] The expression of genes in the ABA, GA, and ethylene biosynthetic and signaling pathways in the presence of water or 10 mm AVG and with or without ethylene was assessed at each genotype\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maximum germination temperature threshold (29\u00c2\u00b0C for Sal and 32\u00c2\u00b0C for PI and NIL-PI).  [3] Consistent with prior germination assays, AVG-treated seeds of all genotypes failed to germinate at their corresponding germination temperature thresholds, and 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene could promote germination recovery only in PI and NIL-PI seeds but not in Sal seeds (Fig. 4B).  [4] Thus, the expression of germination-associated genes LsERF1, LsACS1, LsACO1, LsGA3ox1 (GA 3-OXIDASE1; GA biosynthesis), and LsMAN1 (ENDO-\u00ce\u00b2-MANNANASE1; germination-associated cell wall modification) and dormancy-promoting genes LsGA2ox2 (GA inactivation) and LsNCED4 was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in seeds imbibed in water, AVG, or AVG plus 1 \u00ce\u00bcL L\u00e2\u02c6\u20191 ethylene.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is involved in the process of seed germination and dormancy regulation. The study assesses how exogenous ethylene influences the expression of various genes associated with these processes. The results indicate that ethylene plays a critical role in promoting germination recovery and regulating gene expression related to biosynthetic and regulatory pathways essential for seed development.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and the processes of seed germination and dormancy. The context provides evidence of ethylene's role in gene expression and its impact on germination, indicating a clear relationship supported by experimental findings.",
