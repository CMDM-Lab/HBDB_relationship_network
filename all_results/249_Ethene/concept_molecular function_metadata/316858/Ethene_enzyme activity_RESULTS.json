    "context": "[15] In C and F, seeds of PI and NIL-PI were imbibed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C, and Sal and NIL-Sal seeds were imbibed at 28\u00c2\u00b0C. [16] Error bars indicate se (n = 4). [1] The temperature of imbibition can affect ethylene biosynthesis (; ), possibly confounding responses to ethylene application. [2] To determine the ethylene sensitivity of germination in the absence of endogenous ethylene synthesis, germination assays at different ethylene concentrations were conducted in the presence of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), which reduces ethylene production by inhibiting ACS enzymatic activity . [3] The optimal conditions for AVG inhibitory action on Sal and PI seed germination were identified through assays of the parental seeds across a range of temperatures compared with water-imbibed seeds. [4] Increasing concentrations of AVG progressively lowered maximum germination temperatures for seeds of both genotypes (Supplemental Fig. S6). [5] The maximum germination difference between control and AVG-treated (10 mm) seeds was observed at 32\u00c2\u00b0C for PI and 29\u00c2\u00b0C for Sal seeds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethene is indirectly related to enzyme activity through its role in ethylene biosynthesis, which is influenced by temperature and can affect seed germination. The study discusses the use of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ACC synthase (ACS), a key enzyme in ethylene production. While ethene itself is not directly measured, its production and the associated enzyme activity are critical for understanding germination responses to ethylene.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethene is connected to enzyme activity through the inhibition of ACS by AVG, impacting ethylene production and seed germination. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, limiting the strength of their connection.",
