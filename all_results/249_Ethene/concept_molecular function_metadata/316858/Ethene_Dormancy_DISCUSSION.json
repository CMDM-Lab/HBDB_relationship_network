    "context": " [8] The full recovery of germination in Sal and NIL-Sal seeds after FLU treatment is consistent with the established role of ABA in regulating thermoinhibition in Sal seeds (, ; ).  [9] However, the only partial germination recovery observed in the presence of FLU for seeds with PI alleles indicates the involvement of other factors in regulating the germination of PI seeds. [10] Seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1 continue to be inhibited at high temperatures even in the presence of FLU, indicating their greater dependence upon ethylene compared with seeds having Sal alleles at that locus.  [1] GA and ethylene have been described as acting independently to interfere with ABA inhibitory action for dormancy release (; ).  [2] This study suggests that, in lettuce, there is a concerted action of ethylene and GA to overcome the inhibitory effect of ABA and promote thermotolerance in seeds having PI alleles at Htg9.1 (Fig. 7).  [3] The ability of ethylene to stimulate both Sal and PI seeds to germinate even in the presence of ABA at their germination-permissive temperatures could be due to ethylene altering the GA and ABA hormonal balance to favor GA (Fig. 7).  [4] The opposite patterns of transcript abundances of LsNCED4 and LsGA2ox2 versus LsGA3ox1 in seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1 emphasize the close relationship between ethylene and GA in suppressing ABA inhibitory action.

        "summary": "In this context, ethylene is highlighted as a key hormone that interacts with gibberellins (GA) to regulate seed dormancy and germination. The study indicates that ethylene can counteract the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on dormancy, particularly in seeds with specific genetic backgrounds. This suggests that ethylene plays a significant role in promoting germination and overcoming dormancy, especially under conditions that would typically inhibit seed sprouting.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethylene and dormancy, as the context discusses how ethylene influences the hormonal balance affecting seed germination and dormancy release, supported by evidence of its interaction with ABA and GA.",
