    "context": "Therefore, there are two driving forces with opposed effects on the transfer of VOCs, and hence the limiting step cannot be directly elucidated from the experimental data. Nevertheless, the substitution of the air phase by an aqueous phase in the dense side mediated an enhancement in the transport of acetone, followed by toluene, limonene and hexane, which corresponds to the relative order of K g/w. When biofilm was present on the dense side of the membrane, the experimental data suggested that the transport depended on the existing concentration gradients and was not likely correlated to K o/w or K g/w, due to the addition of a biodegradation step (VOC sink) to the physical transport. In this case, physical and biological processes cannot be separately considered.Membrane bioreactor performance The formation of a thin biofilm over the dense side of the membrane was visually observed four days after the inoculation of the MBR, while REs higher than 99% were recorded for acetone one day after the inoculation of the membrane. It can be hypothesized that pollutant biodegradation in MBRs is not only due to the microorganisms present in the biofilm but also to the suspended biomass, especially for highly water soluble VOCs. A high acetone removal performance was observed during the entire experimentation period, regardless of the inoculation strategies and the GRTs tested, probably due to its high biodegradability (Fig.\u00a03 a). At this point, it is important to stress that the hydraulic retention time of the culture medium in the MBR was high enough (\u223c40 days) to avoid suspended biomass wash-out. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its transport and biodegradation in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system. The presence of a biofilm enhances the removal performance of acetone, indicating its biological function in the degradation process. However, the term 'Biological function, NOS' is not explicitly defined or connected to acetone's role in the study, leading to a lack of clarity regarding its specific relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between acetone and biological function, as acetone's biodegradation is mentioned, but the term 'Biological function, NOS' lacks a clear definition or direct relationship in the context provided.",
