    "context": "REs of methanol, ethanol, acetone and toluene were 85.52, 89.70, 78.41 and 71.87%, respectively. In the third starvation study, the reactor was kept devoid of air and VOC supply for 9days and the system took almost 72h to regain the original efficiency after restart. The overall RE reduced drastically to 63.57% with more than 70% removal efficiency for alcohols. REs of acetone and toluene were 56.43 and 49.59% due to this sudden loading after the prolonged starvation.Performance evaluation of the biotrickling filter during shock loads BTF performance was also evaluated for shock load conditions, in which the inlet VOC loading rate was varied instantaneously, to assess the robustness of the BTF following periods of shock loads. Second phase of transient-state experiments were carried out from day 240 to day 263. The transient state conditions consisted of rapid change in the mass loading rate. The performance of the BTF with respect to removal of overall RE of VOCs and chloroform during shock loads is shown in Fig. 6. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is evaluated in relation to the performance of a biotrickling filter (BTF) under shock load conditions, where the inlet volatile organic compound (VOC) loading rate is varied rapidly. The study assesses how acetone, along with other VOCs, affects the overall removal efficiency (RE) of the BTF during these shock conditions. The results indicate that acetone's removal efficiency is impacted by sudden changes in loading, highlighting its role in the system's response to shock loads.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and shock load conditions, as the study provides evidence of how acetone's removal efficiency is affected during periods of sudden VOC loading in the BTF, indicating a clear relationship within the context of bioreactor performance.",
