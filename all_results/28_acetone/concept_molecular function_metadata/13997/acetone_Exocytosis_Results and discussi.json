    "context": "Cox et al. (1998) found temporary toxicity effect due to increase in the TCE concentration in a BTF. This further reduced the toluene degradation efficiency because increased toluene concentration resulted in competitive advantage of toluene that inhibited TCE degradation. In the present study, toluene and chloroform removals were comparable. Among the mixed VOCs fed to the BTF, biodegradation of toluene and acetone might have triggered the secretion of monoxygenases enzyme which simultaneously biodegraded chloroform. Similar observations were reported by other researchers for biodegradation of chloroform with toluene as a growth substrate (Balasubramanian et al., 2011; Chauhan et al., 1998).Degradation variation along the bed height of the BTF Concentration profiles of CF and other individual VOCs along the depth of the BTF, for various CF inlet loading rates during pseudo steady state conditions are presented in Fig. 5 . Atleast 50% of total VOC was removed at a height of almost 30cm from the inlet of the column for a chloroform loading rate of 5.88g/m3/h. It can be observed from Fig. 5 that 74% of removal was achieved within the first 30cm of BTF for ethanol; where as only 50% of acetone and methanol were removed. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) involved in the biodegradation process within a biotrickling filter (BTF). The study suggests that the biodegradation of acetone, along with toluene, may have triggered the secretion of monooxygenases, which are enzymes involved in the metabolic process. However, the term 'exocytosis' is not explicitly discussed or linked to acetone in the context provided, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone is involved in a biodegradation process that may relate to enzyme secretion, but there is no direct discussion of exocytosis or its specific relationship with acetone.",
