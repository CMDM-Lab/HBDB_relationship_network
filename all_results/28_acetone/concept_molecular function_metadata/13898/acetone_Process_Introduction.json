    "context": "This poly(l-Asp) derivative enables the ready removal of organic solvent during the micelle fabrication process and provides functionality that can respond to a slightly acidic pH (i.e., pHe). The DOX-loaded poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG micelles showed pH-stimulated drug release patterns: a significantly accelerated DOX release at pH 6.8 and a minimized DOX release at pH 7.4. This multifunctionality of poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG is expected to provide efficient strategies and applications for the biomedical field. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like dichloromethane, acetone and ethyl formate are widely used in the oil sands process to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. Acetone and ethyl formate have adverse toxic effects on human central nervous system and environment. And dichloromethane even causes cancer to humans and so the European States have decided to ban the use of it for concentration equal to or greater than 0.1 by mass percent. This research work focuses on the removal of VOCs by adsorption using commercial microporous activated carbon and then regenerates the adsorbed phase. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) used in the oil sands process for bitumen extraction. The process involves the removal of organic solvents, including acetone, due to their toxic effects on human health and the environment. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing VOCs like acetone in industrial processes to mitigate their adverse impacts.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone is directly linked to the industrial process of bitumen extraction and its removal due to toxicity concerns. However, the relationship lacks detailed exploration of how acetone specifically interacts with the process beyond its mention as a harmful VOC.",
