    "context": "The HbA1c% in the last several years was stable at the value of about 6.0%. The average breath acetone concentration for five consecutive sampling of 60-min interval was 0.92ppmv and the corresponding RSD was 12.3%, indicating a significant difference from a group of healthy persons. Similar trend was also observed for the breath samples taken from the same patient several days later, where the average concentration and the RSD were 1.20ppmv and 5.3%, respectively. Although more extensive study should be needed to obtain the final conclusion for the interpretation of above data, these results suggested that the proposed method could be used to an initial screening or a health control of diabetic symptom without blood sampling.Determination of breath acetone from healthy person under the fasting condition It is well-known that breath acetone level increases during fasting condition as the same physiology as insulin dependent diabetes. Additionally, for the diagnosis of diabetes, ketone bodies in urine have been measured especially concentration of acetoacetate, and acetone is produced by the decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Therefore, the determination of breath acetone and urine acetone in fasting condition is one of the most suitable approaches for evaluating the validity of the proposed needle extraction method. First, breath and urine acetone in four healthy male individuals were monitored for three days just before the fasting test. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to physiological aspects through its role as a biomarker for metabolic states, particularly in diabetes. The study highlights that breath acetone levels increase during fasting, paralleling physiological changes in insulin-dependent diabetes. This suggests that measuring breath acetone can serve as a non-invasive method for monitoring diabetic symptoms and metabolic health, indicating its relevance in physiological assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and physiological aspects, as the context discusses how breath acetone levels correlate with metabolic states, particularly in diabetes. The evidence presented supports the use of acetone as a biomarker for physiological evaluation.",
