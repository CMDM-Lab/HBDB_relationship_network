    "context": "Similar trend was also observed for the breath samples taken from the same patient several days later, where the average concentration and the RSD were 1.20ppmv and 5.3%, respectively. Although more extensive study should be needed to obtain the final conclusion for the interpretation of above data, these results suggested that the proposed method could be used to an initial screening or a health control of diabetic symptom without blood sampling.Determination of breath acetone from healthy person under the fasting condition It is well-known that breath acetone level increases during fasting condition as the same physiology as insulin dependent diabetes. Additionally, for the diagnosis of diabetes, ketone bodies in urine have been measured especially concentration of acetoacetate, and acetone is produced by the decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Therefore, the determination of breath acetone and urine acetone in fasting condition is one of the most suitable approaches for evaluating the validity of the proposed needle extraction method. First, breath and urine acetone in four healthy male individuals were monitored for three days just before the fasting test. Variations of the acetone concentration were ranging from 0.31 to 0.59ppmv for breath and from 0.79 to 1.20ppmv for urine. Next, the same healthy males were fasted for 24h, while only pure water was supplied over all the fasting period. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed as a potential biomarker for diagnosing diabetes through breath analysis, particularly during fasting. The relationship to 'adjudication' is implied in the context of evaluating the validity of the proposed method for health control and initial screening of diabetic symptoms. However, 'adjudication' itself is not explicitly defined or explored in detail, making the connection somewhat indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone is related to the process of health evaluation, but 'adjudication' lacks a clear, direct connection or detailed discussion in the context provided.",
