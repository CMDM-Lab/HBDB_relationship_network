    "context": "The observed reduction in sensor response at temperatures above this optimum was attributed to the increased combustion of acetone in the upper layers of the sensing film, reducing the acetone amount penetrating to lower layers. At 350\u00b0C, the response of the back-heated sensor was comparable to that in heated chambers at 400\u00b0C. This is advantageous as lower operating temperatures require less power improving the portability and lowering the energy needs of the device. The average ethanol concentration in the breath is approximately 196ppb with a standard deviation of 224ppb, making it a potentially disturbing analyte during breath acetone measurement. Here, the sensor response to 500ppb ethanol (Fig. 2a) was considerably lower than that to 500ppb acetone at all temperatures demonstrating good acetone selectivity. Furthermore, the maximal response to ethanol was at slightly lower temperatures (\u223c325\u00b0C) than for acetone. This difference in optimum sensing temperature between acetone and ethanol increased the acetone selectivity towards ethanol from 6.9 at 300\u00b0C to 13.4 when operating the detector at 350\u00b0C.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its detection and measurement using a sensor, where it is compared to ethanol as an analyte. The sensor's response to acetone is highlighted as being significantly higher than that to ethanol, indicating acetone's selectivity in breath analysis. The study emphasizes the importance of operating temperatures for optimal sensor performance, particularly in distinguishing acetone from ethanol, which is a potential interfering analyte during breath measurements.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and the analyte, as the context discusses their comparative detection in breath analysis, supported by quantitative data on sensor responses and selectivity. This indicates a clear relationship in the context of sensor technology and analyte measurement.",
        "score": 4
