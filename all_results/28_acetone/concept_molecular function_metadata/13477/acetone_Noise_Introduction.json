    "context": "In general, however, most of these methods are quite costly and have rather limited portability except for DMS that has also high potential for miniaturization. In this regard, chemo-resistive gas sensors based on semiconductor nanoparticles are attractive for breath analysis offering low fabrication costs, high sensitivity, sufficiently low limit of detection and further miniaturization potential. Recently, Cr- or Si-doped WO3 nanoparticles have shown high sensitivity and selectivity to acetone, even up to 90% relative humidity. This has allowed detection of low concentrations of acetone (down to 20ppb) with high signal to noise ratio and high selectivity to ethanol and water vapor. These promising results, however, were obtained in large heated chambers and simulated breath conditions. The application of such nanoparticles as acetone detectors in portable devices is not trivial as reaching sufficiently high temperatures (300\u2013450\u00b0C) at reasonable power consumption requires a locally heated substrate that may result in inhomogeneous temperatures and concentration profiles within the sensing film. Thus, the development of a portable device for breath acetone detection is still challenging but quite attractive. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its detection using chemo-resistive gas sensors made from semiconductor nanoparticles. The term 'noise' refers to the signal-to-noise ratio, which is crucial for accurately detecting low concentrations of acetone in breath analysis. The high signal-to-noise ratio indicates that the sensors can effectively differentiate acetone from other components like ethanol and water vapor, enhancing detection reliability. However, the challenges in developing portable devices for acetone detection due to temperature management and concentration profiles are also highlighted.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and noise, as the effectiveness of acetone detection is directly related to the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensors. The context provides evidence of high sensitivity and selectivity, indicating a clear relationship.",
