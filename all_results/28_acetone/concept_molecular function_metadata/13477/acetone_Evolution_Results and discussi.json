    "context": "The acetone breath concentration measured from the same person during the same day by the Si:WO3 sensor did not change much during physical activity (Fig. 6b, thick solid line) compared to that in Fig. 6a in agreement also with the acetone concentration measured here by PTR-MS (thin solid line). A similar overshoot in the acetone concentration measured by the Si:WO3 sensor is visible as discussed above and its average concentration was about 970ppb, as in Fig. 6a (thick solid line). In contrast, the concentration of isoprene, measured by PTR-MS (Fig. 6b) increased from about 100 to above 240ppb in agreement with the reported release of isoprene during physical activity. The acetone concentration measured by the Si:WO3 sensor (Fig. 6b, thick solid line) followed again the acetone concentration evolution by PTR-MS (thin solid line) and was hardly affected by the presence of isoprene. The alveolar ventilation increased from about 10 to 20L min\u22121 at the start of the physical activity and decreased back to 10L min\u22121 at its end. These results show that the present Si:WO3 sensors are quite robust against changes in ventilation rate and in the presence of isoprene. Furthermore, these sensors were in agreement with PTR-MS for acetone concentrations (ranging from 590 to 980ppb) from different healthy test persons (for 4\u20136min). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured in breath samples to assess its concentration during physical activity, showing a stable evolution compared to isoprene, which increases with activity. The study highlights the robustness of the Si:WO3 sensor in tracking acetone levels, indicating its potential for monitoring metabolic changes during exercise. However, the term 'Evolution' is not explicitly defined in relation to acetone, making the connection somewhat vague.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone's concentration is discussed in the context of its measurement over time (evolution) during physical activity, but the relationship lacks depth and clarity regarding how 'Evolution' specifically relates to acetone beyond mere measurement.",
