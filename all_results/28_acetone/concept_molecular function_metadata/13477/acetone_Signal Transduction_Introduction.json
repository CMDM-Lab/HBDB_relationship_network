    "context": "In general, however, most of these methods are quite costly and have rather limited portability except for DMS that has also high potential for miniaturization. In this regard, chemo-resistive gas sensors based on semiconductor nanoparticles are attractive for breath analysis offering low fabrication costs, high sensitivity, sufficiently low limit of detection and further miniaturization potential. Recently, Cr- or Si-doped WO3 nanoparticles have shown high sensitivity and selectivity to acetone, even up to 90% relative humidity. This has allowed detection of low concentrations of acetone (down to 20ppb) with high signal to noise ratio and high selectivity to ethanol and water vapor. These promising results, however, were obtained in large heated chambers and simulated breath conditions. The application of such nanoparticles as acetone detectors in portable devices is not trivial as reaching sufficiently high temperatures (300\u2013450\u00b0C) at reasonable power consumption requires a locally heated substrate that may result in inhomogeneous temperatures and concentration profiles within the sensing film. Thus, the development of a portable device for breath acetone detection is still challenging but quite attractive. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its detection using chemo-resistive gas sensors made from semiconductor nanoparticles. While the sensors exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity to acetone, the term 'Signal Transduction' is not explicitly defined or connected to acetone's detection mechanism. The focus is primarily on the technical aspects of sensor development rather than any biological or physiological signaling pathways involving acetone.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone is mentioned in the context of sensor technology, but there is no direct discussion of its role in signal transduction or any biological implications. The relationship is more about detection technology than a functional interaction.",
