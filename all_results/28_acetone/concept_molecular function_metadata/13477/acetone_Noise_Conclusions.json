    "context": "Acetone concentrations as low as 20ppb were measured with high signal to noise ratios (>10). Furthermore, the sensor signal (response) was robust against variation in gas (or breath) flow rates down to 0.2L min\u22121 facilitating application of such sensors in real breath measurement conditions. These sensors were applied to breath acetone monitoring of five different test persons and were in agreement (>98%) to high-sensitivity PTR-MS measurements of the same breath samples. The breath acetone concentrations measured by the Si:WO3 sensors had very high signal to noise ratio (60) and the response time was about 27s. The Si:WO3 sensors were selective to acetone both at rest and during physical activity, independently of the respiratory pace or presence of isoprene that is associated with physical activity. Furthermore, these sensors also responded very rapidly to short breath pulses further supporting their potential for breath analysis. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are defined as organic compounds with high vapor pressure that are easily vaporized under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using sensors that exhibit high signal-to-noise ratios, indicating the reliability of acetone detection amidst background noise. The high signal-to-noise ratio (>10) ensures that acetone concentrations can be accurately monitored, even in varying conditions, highlighting the importance of noise management in breath analysis technology. However, the relationship between acetone and noise is primarily technical, focusing on measurement accuracy rather than a biological or chemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone detection is influenced by noise levels in sensor measurements. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship beyond the technical aspect of measurement reliability.",
        "score": 2
