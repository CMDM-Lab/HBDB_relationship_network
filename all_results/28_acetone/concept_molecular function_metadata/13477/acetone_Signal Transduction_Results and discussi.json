    "context": "At the start of breath sampling (\u223c3min), the sensor resistance decreased rapidly and recovered to the initial value after stopping the breath flow (\u223c8min). The calibrated sensor response corresponded to about 970ppb acetone concentration on the average at 3\u20138min. This was in good agreement (>98%) with the acetone concentration reading of the PTR-MS, 980ppb (thin solid line). The present Si:WO3 sensor measured a similar acetone concentration evolution as the PTR-MS and even had a higher signal to noise ratio (60 and 9, respectively). The visible drift for the acetone sensor response (Fig. 6a, thick solid line) is probably due to a catalytic surface reaction of other species present in the breath (e.g. CO) that locally increase the temperature causing also the initial overshoot of the Si:WO3 response. This leads to an initial drop in the resistance that later stabilizes toward that corresponding predominantly to acetone. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using a sensor that detects its concentration in breath samples. The sensor's response is influenced by the presence of other species, indicating a complex interaction during signal transduction. However, the relationship between acetone and the broader concept of signal transduction is not explicitly detailed, focusing instead on the sensor's performance and response characteristics.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone is involved in a measurement process that relates to signal transduction through sensor technology. However, there is no detailed discussion of how acetone directly influences or interacts with signal transduction mechanisms.",
