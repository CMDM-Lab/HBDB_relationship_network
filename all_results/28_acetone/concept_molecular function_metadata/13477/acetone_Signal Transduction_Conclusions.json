    "context": "Acetone concentrations as low as 20ppb were measured with high signal to noise ratios (>10). Furthermore, the sensor signal (response) was robust against variation in gas (or breath) flow rates down to 0.2L min\u22121 facilitating application of such sensors in real breath measurement conditions. These sensors were applied to breath acetone monitoring of five different test persons and were in agreement (>98%) to high-sensitivity PTR-MS measurements of the same breath samples. The breath acetone concentrations measured by the Si:WO3 sensors had very high signal to noise ratio (60) and the response time was about 27s. The Si:WO3 sensors were selective to acetone both at rest and during physical activity, independently of the respiratory pace or presence of isoprene that is associated with physical activity. Furthermore, these sensors also responded very rapidly to short breath pulses further supporting their potential for breath analysis. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are defined as organic compounds with high vapor pressure that are easily vaporized under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using sensors that exhibit high signal-to-noise ratios, indicating effective signal transduction for breath analysis. The sensors' ability to detect low concentrations of acetone and respond rapidly to breath pulses highlights their role in monitoring acetone levels, which is relevant for physiological assessments. However, the relationship between acetone and signal transduction is primarily focused on the measurement technology rather than a direct biochemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone is linked to signal transduction through the sensor technology used for its detection. While the context discusses the effectiveness of the sensors in measuring acetone, it does not delve into deeper biochemical or physiological implications of this relationship.",
        "score": 3
