    "context": "At the start of breath sampling (\u223c3min), the sensor resistance decreased rapidly and recovered to the initial value after stopping the breath flow (\u223c8min). The calibrated sensor response corresponded to about 970ppb acetone concentration on the average at 3\u20138min. This was in good agreement (>98%) with the acetone concentration reading of the PTR-MS, 980ppb (thin solid line). The present Si:WO3 sensor measured a similar acetone concentration evolution as the PTR-MS and even had a higher signal to noise ratio (60 and 9, respectively). The visible drift for the acetone sensor response (Fig. 6a, thick solid line) is probably due to a catalytic surface reaction of other species present in the breath (e.g. CO) that locally increase the temperature causing also the initial overshoot of the Si:WO3 response. This leads to an initial drop in the resistance that later stabilizes toward that corresponding predominantly to acetone. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using a sensor that exhibits a specific response to its concentration in breath samples. The mention of 'noise' refers to the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor, indicating the clarity of the acetone measurement amidst potential interference from other breath components. While both terms are present, their relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the sensor's performance rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction between acetone and noise.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone is measured in a system where noise affects the sensor's performance. However, there is no detailed discussion of how noise impacts acetone's biological significance or its chemical properties.",
