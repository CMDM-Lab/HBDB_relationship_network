    "context": "Fig. 5 shows a clear reduction of sensor resistance from 2.51 to 2.41M\u03a9 in response to even 20ppb acetone at 90% RH corresponding to a sensor response of 0.042 which is comparable to that (0.08) in bulkier, heated chambers at 400\u00b0C. Furthermore, this sensor exhibited a high signal to noise ratio (>10) and the ability to differentiate in sensor response (10%) even between 50ppb and 60ppb of acetone, further indicating the accuracy of the present sensor and that even lower limits of detection are possible.Exhaled breath analysis Undoubtedly, real breath measurements are needed to validate the present devices for breath acetone monitoring. Here, human breath was analyzed simultaneously by this novel sensor device and by state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity PTR-MS. As the alveolar levels of blood-borne volatile species, such as acetone and isoprene, are best reflected by the end tidal fraction of each exhalation phase, here, the end tidal volume of the breath was sampled by a flow-controlled valve (Fig. 1b). Fig. 6a shows the concentration of acetone in tidal part of the respiratory cycle of a healthy test person at rest measured by the present Si:WO3 sensor (thick solid line) and PTR-MS for acetone (thin solid line) and isoprene (dotted line). The acetone concentration measured by Si:WO3 sensor was calculated from the calibrated sensor response at 90% RH and at 70mLmin\u22121 flow. At the start of breath sampling (\u223c3min), the sensor resistance decreased rapidly and recovered to the initial value after stopping the breath flow (\u223c8min). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is analyzed in relation to exhalation through a novel sensor device designed for breath acetone monitoring. The study highlights the sensor's ability to detect acetone levels in exhaled breath, emphasizing the importance of measuring end-tidal concentrations to accurately reflect blood-borne volatile species. The relationship is significant as it demonstrates the potential for noninvasive monitoring of acetone in respiratory analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and exhalation, as the context discusses the measurement of acetone in exhaled breath using a sensor, indicating a clear functional relationship in the study of breath analysis.",
