    "context": "The extracted solution was then concentrated and the identity of the product molecule was determined using electrospray mass spectroscopy (Micromass Q-TOF-2). The acid-catalyzed reaction of acetone with resorcinol immobilized in protonated PFSIs was initially hypothesized to yield an immobilized flavan compound as the condensation product (4-(3,4-Dihydro-7-hydroxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-2-yl)-1,3-benzenediol) according to the reaction scheme shown in  Fig. 1  . Upon exposure to acetone, the membranes were shown to change from transparent to bright yellow with the intensity of the color increasing with increased concentration of acetone in the system. The exposure concentrations for this study were targeted at the nominal acetone concentrations found in the exhaled breath of diabetics. As the resorcinol-imbibed membrane is exposed to varying concentrations of acetone there is a very noticeable increase in absorbance at the near-UV to visible range (380\u2013430nm) which accounts for the visible shift in the membranes as seen in  Fig. 2. A strong visible response was recorded at 400.69nm, which was attributed to the formation of the hypothesized product. The visible response at 400.69nm also showed a strong correlation (R 2=0.99) to the measured concentration of acetone added to the system as demonstrated in  Fig. 3. The hypothesized reaction product of Fig. 1 was confirmed using electrospray mass spectroscopy. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to exhalation through its presence in the breath of diabetics, where specific concentrations of acetone are targeted for study. The research investigates how varying concentrations of acetone affect the properties of a resorcinol-imbibed membrane, which changes color upon exposure, indicating a measurable response related to acetone levels typically found in exhaled breath. This suggests a direct relevance of acetone in breath analysis for potential diagnostic purposes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and exhalation, as the study focuses on acetone concentrations found in the breath of diabetics and their measurable effects on a membrane, indicating a clear relationship in the context of breath analysis.",
        "score": 4
