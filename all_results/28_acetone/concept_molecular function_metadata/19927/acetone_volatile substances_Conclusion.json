    "context": "Good repeatabilities were obtained at two levels of concentration (relative standard deviation <5%). A good reproducibility was observed with a variability of the response coefficient of less than 10% of the mean initial value. The first measurements with the developed method were carried out in the urban area of Douai. Result shows that the most volatile compounds are the most abundant: ethanol, acetone and acetaldehyde with an average of 2.10, 1.75 and 1.37ppb respectively. The time series plots for toluene, ethanol and acetaldehyde have shown a correlation with emission coming from traffic at this urban site. Acetone higher concentrations were observed on the early hours for few days. Further measurements will be established for a better understanding of the temporal evolution of these compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as one of the most abundant volatile compounds measured in the urban area of Douai, alongside ethanol and acetaldehyde. The study highlights the correlation of these volatile substances with traffic emissions, indicating that acetone is part of a broader category of volatile substances that are monitored for environmental analysis. However, the specific interactions or implications of acetone within this group are not elaborated upon.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone is categorized as a volatile substance and is included in the analysis of urban air quality. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific significance of acetone beyond its classification as a volatile compound.",
        "score": 3
