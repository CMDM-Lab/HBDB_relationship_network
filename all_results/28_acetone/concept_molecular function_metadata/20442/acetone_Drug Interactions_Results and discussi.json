    "context": "In addition, polar molecules (acetone) have two additional types of attractive force, dipole/induced\u2013dipole forces and dipole\u2013dipole forces. So the adsorption behaviors of non-polar and polar molecule are significantly different. PCH provided much higher adsorption capacity for acetone with increasing equilibrium concentration but lower adsorption capacity for aromatic VOCs (Fig. 3). Therefore, adsorption capacity of acetone on PCH may be increased due to interaction between dipoles of adsorbate\u2013adsorbate at high pressure ranges. At high relative pressures (above 0.5P/P 0), the adsorbed amounts of VOCs exceeded the equivalent amount of a monolayer and gas molecules were not directly related to the nature of adsorbent. There are \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 dispersion interactions among molecules of aromatic ring compounds (BTEX) with face-to-face or offset face-to-face orientation. The orientation contribution is equivalent to interactions of the weak hydrogen bond. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its adsorption behavior on a specific adsorbent (PCH) and the types of attractive forces it experiences, such as dipole/induced-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions. However, there is no direct mention of drug interactions involving acetone, making the relationship between acetone and drug interactions unclear and indirect. The focus is primarily on physical adsorption properties rather than any pharmacological implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone is mentioned in the context of its physical properties and adsorption behavior, but there is no direct discussion or evidence linking it to drug interactions.",
