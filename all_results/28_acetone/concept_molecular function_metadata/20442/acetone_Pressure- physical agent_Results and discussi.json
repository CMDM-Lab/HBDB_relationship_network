    "context": "In addition, polar molecules (acetone) have two additional types of attractive force, dipole/induced\u2013dipole forces and dipole\u2013dipole forces. So the adsorption behaviors of non-polar and polar molecule are significantly different. PCH provided much higher adsorption capacity for acetone with increasing equilibrium concentration but lower adsorption capacity for aromatic VOCs (Fig. 3). Therefore, adsorption capacity of acetone on PCH may be increased due to interaction between dipoles of adsorbate\u2013adsorbate at high pressure ranges. At high relative pressures (above 0.5P/P 0), the adsorbed amounts of VOCs exceeded the equivalent amount of a monolayer and gas molecules were not directly related to the nature of adsorbent. There are \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 dispersion interactions among molecules of aromatic ring compounds (BTEX) with face-to-face or offset face-to-face orientation. The orientation contribution is equivalent to interactions of the weak hydrogen bond. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is described as a polar molecule that exhibits specific adsorption behaviors influenced by physical pressure. The text highlights that the adsorption capacity of acetone on a particular adsorbent (PCH) increases with higher equilibrium concentrations and pressures, indicating a significant interaction between acetone's dipole characteristics and the physical pressure applied during adsorption processes. This relationship emphasizes how physical agents like pressure can affect the adsorption dynamics of polar molecules such as acetone.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and physical pressure, as the context discusses how pressure influences the adsorption capacity of acetone, supported by evidence of increased interaction at higher pressures.",
