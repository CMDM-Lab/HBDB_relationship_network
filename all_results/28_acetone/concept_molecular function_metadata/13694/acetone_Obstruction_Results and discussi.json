    "context": "Poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP45)-b-PEG, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP32)-b-PEG, poly(l-Asp)-b-PEG, and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA70)-b-PEG were synthesized; numerals indicate the molar % of DEAP or DOCA coupled to one unit of l-Asp. Fig. 2 shows the solubility of poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG in various solvents such as acetic acid, acetone, chloroform, DMF, DMSO, ethanol, n-hexane, methanol, dichloromethane, and toluene. Poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG evidenced no significant differences from other block copolymers in its solubility for non-volatile organic solvents (e.g., acetic acid, DMF and DMSO). However, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG displayed a relatively high solubility in volatile organic solvents such as dichloromethane (polymer solubility \u223c1.15mM), chloroform (polymer solubility \u223c1.24mM), and acetone (polymer solubility \u223c1.29mM), which is comparable with those of other poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG block copolymers and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG. It is assumed that the solubility of poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG is determined by relative lipophilic/lipophobic balance between the poly(l-Asp) backbone and the side group grafted to DEAP. As a result, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG with a relatively high mole ratio % DEAP was efficiently dissolved in volatile organic solvents. Interestingly, the incorporation of DEAP into poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG induced an apparent change in the physicochemical properties of block copolymer. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a solvent used in the synthesis of various block copolymers, specifically poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG. However, there is no direct relationship or discussion regarding obstruction or any physiological implications related to acetone. The mention of obstruction is absent, indicating no relevant connection between acetone and obstruction in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between acetone and obstruction, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
