    "context": "After 50h of experimental duration, the concentration of Acetone was observed to reduce by 18.5%, Ethylbenzene was reduced by 25.4% while Xylene was reduced by 29.4%. It can be inferred from these results that Xylene readily reacts with ozone and degrades rapidly followed by Ethylbenzene and Acetone. It was also observed that no formaldehyde formation took place during the reaction between ozone and any of the pure chemicals. It is apparent from Fig. 5 that Ozone reaction with Acetone is a slow process. In order to improve this reaction process, ozone was injected intermittently in to the chamber. Fig. 6 shows the effect of intermittent injection of ozone on reaction with Acetone. It was found that the concentration level of Acetone was reduced by 12.2% within 7.5h. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is involved in a chemical process where its concentration is monitored during reactions with ozone. The study highlights the reduction in acetone levels over time, indicating its reactivity and the efficiency of the process. The results suggest that the reaction process can be optimized by adjusting the method of ozone injection to enhance acetone degradation, demonstrating a clear relationship between acetone and the process of ozone reaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and the process of its reaction with ozone, supported by quantitative data showing concentration changes and the impact of process adjustments on acetone levels.",
        "score": 4
