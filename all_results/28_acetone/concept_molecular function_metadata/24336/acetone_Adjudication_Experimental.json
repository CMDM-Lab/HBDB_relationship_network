    "context": "The cycle time was set at 28s and the sample time 10,000ms. The GC column utilized was a 5m length methyl silicone (DB-1), 0.25\u03bcm film thickness and 500\u03bcm (i.d.). The sample flow rate was set at 25mlmin\u22121. For the determination of acetone using GC-IMS, the tedlar bag was connected to a teflon tube, which was adjusted in front of the inlet of the instrument. GC-IMS peaks were identified using the retention time and drift time of vapor standards in hexane. The vapor calibration standards were prepared as described in the literature. 2.3.3 ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned in relation to its determination using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) for vapor analysis. However, the term 'Adjudication' does not appear to have any direct connection or relevance to acetone within the provided context, as it primarily focuses on the technical aspects of measuring acetone without discussing any adjudicative processes or implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between acetone and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any direct interaction or relevance to each other.",
