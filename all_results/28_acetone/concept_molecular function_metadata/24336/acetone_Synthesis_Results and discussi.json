    "context": "In the present study, in order to distinguish between endogenous substances and exogenous contaminants the calculation of the alveolar gradient was performed for each of the substances observed in expired air for over 71% of the volunteers. Thus, substances with positive alveolar gradient indicate that their rate of synthesis in the body is greater than their rate of clearance by metabolism or excretion. It is assumed that the substances showing positive alveolar gradient (Table 1) are those that derive from one or different metabolic processes that are constantly in progress and may also have a cumulative behavior. Among them acetone showed significantly greater rates of synthesis than other substances, especially after 48h of fasting. Other ketones identified were 2-pentanone and 2-butanone. Phenol was also among the substances with highest positive alveolar gradient. Phenol originates from foodstuffs and arises from metabolism of aromatic amino acids. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a substance with a significantly greater rate of synthesis in the body compared to its clearance through metabolism or excretion, particularly after fasting for 48 hours. This indicates that acetone is produced endogenously, reflecting its role in metabolic processes. The mention of positive alveolar gradients for acetone suggests it is synthesized at a higher rate than it is eliminated, highlighting its relevance in metabolic studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and its synthesis, as the context provides evidence of acetone's endogenous production and its metabolic significance, particularly in relation to fasting.",
        "score": 4
