    "context": "Meanwhile, the number of compounds identified in the cleaning products sold in Korea (37) exceeded the number identified in the cleaning products sold in Canada (8), although the number of cleaning products surveyed in the two studies is not same. Similarly, Zhu et al. identified just one compound, ethyl acetate, in one nail color remover sold in Canada, whereas the current study determined four other compounds (acetone, butyl acetate, cyclohexane, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-dioxolane) in three nail color removers sold in Korea.Frequency of occurrence The frequency of occurrence for each analyte is presented in Table 3 . Of the 59 household products analyzed, 58 were found to emit 1 or 72 compounds at chromatographic peak areas above 104 and at a spectral search quality of greater than 70%. There were 11 analytes detected at a frequency of more than 10%: limonene (44%), ethanol (31%), acetone (19%), \u03b1-pinene (19%), decane (17%), toluene (17%), \u03b2-myrcene (12%), m,p-xylenes (12%), ammonia (10%), ethylbenzene (10%), and hexane (10%). In contrast, Sack et al. reported that from the purge-and-trap technique, limonene was not detected in any of 67 households sold in the U.S.A., and that \u03b1-pinene was only detected in 5 of 991 households. Three types of terpenes (limonene, \u03b1-pinene, and \u03b2-myrcene) can potentially react with ozone to generate secondary pollutants with other oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals and nitrogen oxides. These terpenes are added to household products due to their favorable odor and solvent properties. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in cleaning products sold in Korea. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed beyond their presence in the same category of household products. The context does not provide any direct interaction or comparative analysis between acetone and 4-xylene, indicating a mere co-occurrence rather than a significant connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and 4-xylene are both identified as VOCs in cleaning products, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or specific significance in the context provided.",
        "score": 2
