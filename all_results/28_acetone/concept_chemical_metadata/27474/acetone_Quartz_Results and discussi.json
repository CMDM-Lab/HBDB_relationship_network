    "context": "A loss of 110.0368 m/z is observed in our data, associated with cleaving of the resorcinol group from the flavan ring structure. In addition, opening of the ring at the ester and loss of the attached resorcinol, the ester, and part of the ring structure would account for the loss of 152.0474 m/z, yielding the most prominent feature observed in Fig. 4. In order to gain a better understanding of the kinetics of this reaction, we built an in-situ flow cell system to allow monitoring of the UV/vis spectrum during exposure of the membrane. To achieve this, the membrane was placed in a holder inside a sealed quartz cuvette maintained at 60\u00b0C. Varying concentrations of acetone vapor were then flowed continuously through the quartz chamber allowing for a constant concentration exposure to the membrane. UV/Vis was acquired over the course of the exposure at 30s intervals as can be seen in  Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the visible region as 0.64ppmv of acetone is exposed to the membrane for 15min. Taking a cross-section of this data at 400nm allows for observation of the kinetics of this reaction as shown in  Fig. 6. As the objective was to develop a fast and inexpensive method for acetone detection, we devised a new sensor system by which the absorbance of the exposed membrane can be measured instantaneously in a compact and portable system, as shown in  Fig. 7.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is utilized as a vapor in a quartz cuvette to study its interaction with a membrane under UV/Vis spectroscopy. The quartz serves as a transparent medium that allows for the monitoring of acetone's absorbance properties, facilitating the development of a sensor for acetone detection. The relationship is primarily experimental, focusing on the physical properties of acetone in a quartz environment rather than any chemical interaction between the two.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone and quartz are related through the experimental setup where quartz is used to measure acetone vapor. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interaction beyond this methodological context.",
