    "context": "This observation is consistent with the fact that the alcohols are unlikely to react with resorcinol under these conditions. Ketones other than acetone are present in human breath in much smaller proportions (<30ppb levels relative to ppm levels) and include butanone and 2-propanone. We have therefore not attempted to calibrate their response. Our future work will focus on identifying the immobilized reagents necessary for the detection and measurement of other organic compounds in human breath at ppb levels as well as to screen whether such compounds interfere with the quantification of acetone levels using this approach. Such multi-gas detection capability is necessary to de-convolute the complex metabolic processes that are responsible for their generation. Furthermore, the presence of water in sufficient quantities can have a significant influence on the observed response. The relative humidity in a human breath sample (originally at 100%) collected at ambient temperatures will be reduced to about 15% at 60\u00b0C temperature of the sensing reaction. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a ketone and is mentioned alongside other organic chemicals present in human breath. The discussion focuses on the detection and measurement of acetone and other organic compounds, highlighting the need for multi-gas detection to understand complex metabolic processes. While acetone is a specific example of an organic chemical, the relationship is primarily about its classification rather than a detailed interaction or functional significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone is categorized as an organic chemical, but the context does not provide a detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance beyond its classification.",
