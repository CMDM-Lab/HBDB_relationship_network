    "context": "In addition to acetone, other volatile organics are present in human breath in significant quantities such as methyl-, ethyl-, and propyl-alcohol and may present potential interferences. We have determined that our system does not undergo a colorimetric response to these compounds under the same exposure conditions as those of acetone. This observation is consistent with the fact that the alcohols are unlikely to react with resorcinol under these conditions. Ketones other than acetone are present in human breath in much smaller proportions (<30ppb levels relative to ppm levels) and include butanone and 2-propanone. We have therefore not attempted to calibrate their response. Our future work will focus on identifying the immobilized reagents necessary for the detection and measurement of other organic compounds in human breath at ppb levels as well as to screen whether such compounds interfere with the quantification of acetone levels using this approach. Such multi-gas detection capability is necessary to de-convolute the complex metabolic processes that are responsible for their generation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant volatile organic compound present in human breath, while other ketones, such as butanone and 2-propanone, are mentioned as being present in much smaller quantities. The discussion highlights the need for accurate detection of acetone and its potential interference with the measurement of other ketones. This indicates a relationship where acetone serves as a primary focus in breath analysis, while other ketones are secondary and less significant in concentration.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone is discussed in relation to other ketones in the context of breath analysis. While they are both categorized as ketones, the focus remains primarily on acetone, with limited interaction or significance attributed to the other ketones mentioned.",
        "score": 3
