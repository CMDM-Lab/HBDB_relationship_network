    "context": "Poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP45)-b-PEG, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP32)-b-PEG, poly(l-Asp)-b-PEG, and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA70)-b-PEG were synthesized; numerals indicate the molar % of DEAP or DOCA coupled to one unit of l-Asp. Fig. 2 shows the solubility of poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG in various solvents such as acetic acid, acetone, chloroform, DMF, DMSO, ethanol, n-hexane, methanol, dichloromethane, and toluene. Poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG evidenced no significant differences from other block copolymers in its solubility for non-volatile organic solvents (e.g., acetic acid, DMF and DMSO). However, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG displayed a relatively high solubility in volatile organic solvents such as dichloromethane (polymer solubility \u223c1.15mM), chloroform (polymer solubility \u223c1.24mM), and acetone (polymer solubility \u223c1.29mM), which is comparable with those of other poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG block copolymers and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG. It is assumed that the solubility of poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG is determined by relative lipophilic/lipophobic balance between the poly(l-Asp) backbone and the side group grafted to DEAP. As a result, poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG with a relatively high mole ratio % DEAP was efficiently dissolved in volatile organic solvents. Interestingly, the incorporation of DEAP into poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG induced an apparent change in the physicochemical properties of block copolymer. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic solvent that demonstrates significant solubility for the synthesized block copolymers, specifically poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG. The study highlights acetone's role as a solvent in evaluating the solubility of these organic polymer products, indicating its importance in the formulation and application of these materials.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and the organic solvent product, as acetone is explicitly mentioned as a solvent that influences the solubility of the synthesized polymers, supported by quantitative solubility data.",
