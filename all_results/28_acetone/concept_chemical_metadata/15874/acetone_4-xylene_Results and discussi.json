    "context": "At low reaction temperature and independently of the VOC target, X T > X CO2 as a consequence of VOC adsorption on all the porous carbon aerogels. The temperature range where this occurs depends on the nature of the VOC and the porous texture of carbon aerogels, i.e. on the interactions between both phases. Fig. 5 shows that the ability of these catalysts for acetone combustion is less than that for aromatic (xylenes) compounds. The combustion of p-xylene is complete at 180\u00b0C while in the same experimental conditions acetone combustion only reached around 25%. Similar results were found in the bibliography. O\u2019Malley for example described that the reactivity pattern varies on the different Pt\u2013inorganic supports as: alcohols>aromatics>ketones>carboxylic acids>alkanes, according to the weakness of C\u2013H bonds. To highlight the equilibrium between both adsorption and catalytic processes, we performed experiments in which the weight of the catalyst was changed so as to vary the contact time. The results obtained in the m-xylene combustion at 190\u00b0C are shown in Fig. 6 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and 4-xylene are compared in terms of their combustion reactivity on porous carbon aerogels. The study indicates that acetone exhibits significantly lower combustion efficiency (around 25%) compared to 4-xylene, which combusts completely at 180\u00b0C. This highlights a clear difference in the catalytic behavior and reactivity of these two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under similar experimental conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and 4-xylene, as the context provides quantitative data on their combustion efficiencies, demonstrating a clear relationship in their reactivity patterns. The comparison indicates that acetone is less reactive than 4-xylene, which is relevant in the study of VOCs.",
