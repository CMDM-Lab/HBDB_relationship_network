    "context": "In this work we prepared two series of Pt-based carbon aerogels. Platinum was deposited by impregnation or doping and carbonized at different temperatures. We then studied the behavior of these samples as VOC adsorbents or VOC combustion catalysts and analyzed the influence of textural parameters on these processes and the relations between them in different experimental conditions. Toluene, xylenes and acetone were selected as target VOC molecules, as they are representative examples of aromatic and oxygenated organic compounds. Two series of organic aerogels were prepared by the sol\u2013gel procedure from the polymerisation reaction of resorcinol (R) and formaldehyde (F) in water (W). All the samples were prepared using a molar ratio R/F=1/2 and R/W=1/8. In the first sample series (A series) Na2CO3 in a concentration of 1.4\u00d710\u22124 M was used as a polymerization catalyst.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both identified as target volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used in the study of Pt-based carbon aerogels for their adsorption and combustion catalytic properties. They are mentioned together as representative examples of aromatic and oxygenated organic compounds, indicating a shared relevance in the research focus on VOCs, but without detailed interaction or comparative analysis between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and toluene are grouped together as target VOCs in the study, indicating they share a common purpose in the research. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "score": 2
