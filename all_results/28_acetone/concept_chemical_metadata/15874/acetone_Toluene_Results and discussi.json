    "context": "Textural characteristics have a clear influence on the adsorption process, which is also affected by the interaction of the VOCs with the carbon surface, which depends on the chemical nature of the adsorbent\u2013adsorptive. The presence of oxygenated surface groups on the carbon surface favours hydrophilic interactions with water or other polar solvents. The dipolar moment of Toluene is 0.4D while for acetone it is 2.91D. This means that while acetone adsorption is favoured in the samples obtained at low carbonization temperature, for toluene adsorption, the opposite is true. Thus, toluene adsorption is enhanced with increasing carbonization temperature, first by the progressive hydrophobic character of the carbon surface, which favours chemical interactions, and secondly, from a textural point of view, because toluene can access the greater volume of albeit narrower microporosity, due to the flat shape of the toluene molecule. However, acetone adsorption is favoured in large micropores with hydrophilic surfaces obtained at low carbonization temperature. Toluene adsorption was studied in dynamic conditions. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are compared regarding their adsorption characteristics on carbon surfaces, influenced by the chemical nature of the adsorbent and the adsorbates. Acetone, with a higher dipolar moment, is favored for adsorption at lower carbonization temperatures due to its hydrophilic interactions, while toluene's adsorption improves with higher temperatures due to its hydrophobic nature and molecular shape, allowing better access to micropores. This highlights a significant relationship between the two VOCs in terms of their adsorption behavior under varying conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and toluene, supported by detailed discussion of their adsorption characteristics and how these are influenced by temperature and surface properties. The context provides clear evidence of their differing behaviors in adsorption processes.",
