    "context": "The retention efficiency of exhaled acetone determined for this collector (using 7.6 L of exhaled air bubbled in 5 mL of ice-cooled water) is 78%. 23 This factor and acetone losses of 24% during the freezing, storage, and defrosting procedure, constant for 1 to 60 days, 23 was taken into account in the chemical analysis. After collection, the liquid phase was transferred from the impinger to a capped vial and stored in a freezer at \u2212112\u00b0F (\u221280\u00b0C) until acetone analysis could be done. The identification of acetone in defrosted aqueous extracts was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and quantitative determination was done by spectrophotometry after reaction with salicylaldehyde. 24 Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc) statistical software. The categorical variables are shown as absolute (n) and relative frequency (%), and the groups were compared by Pearson \u03c72 test. To test normality, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and salicylaldehyde are connected through a chemical analysis process where acetone is quantitatively determined after reacting with salicylaldehyde. The study highlights the method of identifying acetone in aqueous extracts using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indicating a direct analytical relationship between the two compounds in the context of measuring acetone levels.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and salicylaldehyde, as the latter is used in the analytical process to quantify acetone. This relationship is supported by the methodology described, showing a clear functional interaction in the context of chemical analysis.",
