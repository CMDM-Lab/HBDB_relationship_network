    "context": "In this context, since odorous emissions are complex mixtures of sulphur/nitrogen derived compounds and VOCs at concentrations in the order of mg\u00a0m\u22123\u2013\u03bcg\u00a0m\u22123, results reported in literature studies for MBRs cannot be directly applied to odor abatement. Besides, it has been hypothesized that the low substrate concentrations is one of the main limitations of MBRs since they might not sustain an active microbial population (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2008a). The present study aims at investigating the performance of a flat MBR for the treatment of a mixture of VOCs (acetone, toluene, limonene and hexane) at trace level concentrations in order to evaluate: i) the influence of VOC nature on the transport through the membrane and on the biodegradation, ii) the performance of MBRs at the low VOC loads typically found in WWTP odorous emissions (mg\u00a0m\u22123) at different gas residence times (GRT, defined as the volume of the gas chamber divided by the gas flow rate) and iii) the dynamics of microbial biodiversity linked to the MBR performance. Chemicals and reagents Acetone was purchased from Chem-Lab (+99%), toluene and limonene from Sigma Aldrich with a purity >99% and >97%, respectively, and hexane (purity +99%) from Acros Organics (USA). All chemicals for mineral salt medium (MSM) preparation were purchased from Acros Organics (USA) with a purity of at least 98%, and vitamins were obtained from Laboratories Vitarmonyl (France).Bioreactor set-up A laboratory-scale flat membrane bioreactor made of Perpex was used (Fig.\u00a01 ). In this membrane bioreactor configuration, the VOC and O2 laden gas stream circulates through one side of the membrane, while on the other side an attached biofilm is submerged into a mineral salt solution that provides the water and nutrients required for microbial growth. This mineral salt solution is recycled, buffered to maintain a suitable pH and replaced periodically with fresh solution to replenish nutrients and avoid toxic by-products accumulation. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being treated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) alongside other chemicals like toluene, limonene, and hexane. The study focuses on the performance of the MBR in treating mixtures of VOCs at trace levels, indicating that acetone is part of a broader category of chemicals being analyzed for their biodegradation and transport properties in wastewater treatment processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone is included in a list of chemicals being studied in the MBR context. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and acetone is treated as one of many chemicals rather than having a specific interaction or significance highlighted.",
