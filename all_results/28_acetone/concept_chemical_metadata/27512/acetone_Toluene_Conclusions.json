    "context": "Finally, it must be stressed that the biodiversity of the microbial community present in the bioreactor remained constant over time for the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Chlamydiae, while Acidobacteria, Chlorobi, Firmicutes and Chloroflexi were no longer found after day 42 of operation (Fig.\u00a05 and Table 2). This work confirmed the efficiency of MBRs for the treatment of water soluble and moderately soluble VOCs. Whereas the abiotic test showed that the presence of an aqueous phase over the dense side of the membrane induced a higher overall mass transfer resistance, biofilm activity mediated higher concentration gradients over the membrane and therefore a more efficient VOC transport. Thus, REs higher than 93% were always obtained in the MBR for acetone and toluene at GRTs as low as 7\u00a0s. In the particular case of limonene, the inoculation of the membrane with an inoculum embedded in silicon-oil increased its removal performance up to 90% at 7\u00a0s of GRT. Nevertheless, hexane biodegradation was limited by its mass transfer over the membrane regardless of the GRT (RE\u00a0<\u00a024%), which pointed out toward the selection of the optimum membrane material as a key design criterion determining the performance of MBRs for the treatment of highly hydrophobic VOCs. Finally, the microbiological analysis of the communities present in the MBR showed a high species richness despite the limited C source spectrum, and a high structural similarity between the microbial populations present in the suspended culture and in the biofilm.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) effectively treated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The study highlights that high removal efficiencies (REs) exceeding 93% were achieved for both compounds at low hydraulic retention times (GRTs). This indicates a significant relationship in their treatment efficiency within the same bioreactor system, showcasing their comparable behavior in the biodegradation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and toluene, as both are treated in the same bioreactor with demonstrated high removal efficiencies. The context provides quantitative data supporting their effective treatment, indicating a clear relationship in the context of VOC biodegradation.",
