    "context": "Table 5 gathers the average concentrations for the quantified compounds, their maximum and minimum. Ethanol, acetone and acetaldehyde showed the highest concentration levels with an average of 2.10, 1.75 and 1.37ppb respectively. Time series plots have shown a correlation with emissions coming from motor vehicle with relatively high concentrations between 6\u20138A.M. and P.M. for three compounds: toluene, ethanol and acetaldehyde (Fig. 10 ). Acetone showed a different temporal trend from toluene, higher concentrations were observed on the early hours of few days (Fig. 10). This temporal variation can be probably attributed to remote sources contribution. For a better understanding of these compound sources, field campaign for several months will be conducted on a French urban/industrial site. The development of an automated method based on thermal desorption coupled to a GC-FID for the online ambient measurement of OVOC and nitrile compounds was successfully achieved. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both quantified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with varying concentration levels in the air. The data indicates that while both compounds are present in the environment, their temporal trends differ, with acetone showing higher concentrations during specific early hours compared to toluene. This suggests that their sources and emissions may not be directly correlated, highlighting distinct patterns in their atmospheric behavior.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone and toluene are both discussed in terms of their concentrations and temporal trends as VOCs. However, the context does not provide a detailed interaction or functional relationship between the two compounds beyond their presence in the same study.",
        "score": 3
