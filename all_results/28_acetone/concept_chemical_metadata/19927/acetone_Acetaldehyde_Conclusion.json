    "context": "Good repeatabilities were obtained at two levels of concentration (relative standard deviation <5%). A good reproducibility was observed with a variability of the response coefficient of less than 10% of the mean initial value. The first measurements with the developed method were carried out in the urban area of Douai. Result shows that the most volatile compounds are the most abundant: ethanol, acetone and acetaldehyde with an average of 2.10, 1.75 and 1.37ppb respectively. The time series plots for toluene, ethanol and acetaldehyde have shown a correlation with emission coming from traffic at this urban site. Acetone higher concentrations were observed on the early hours for few days. Further measurements will be established for a better understanding of the temporal evolution of these compounds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the urban area of Douai. The study highlights their concentrations, with acetone being more abundant than acetaldehyde. Both compounds show a correlation with traffic emissions, indicating they are part of the same environmental monitoring effort, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between them is discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and acetaldehyde are mentioned together in the context of VOC measurements related to traffic emissions. However, their relationship is not explored in detail, indicating a general connection rather than a significant interaction.",
        "score": 2
