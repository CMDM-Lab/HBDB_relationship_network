    "context": "In this section, these two practical response coefficients were compared to the theoretical response coefficients in order to determine the most reliable calibration method. Table 2 shows the ECN, the theoretical response coefficients and the practical response coefficients for both of the calibration methods. The response coefficients of toluene, butyl acetate, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol and 2-butanone for the two methods are in agreement with the theory (Table 2). Moreover, five compounds (furan, 2-methyl furan, ETBE, acetone and ethanol) have a response coefficient superior to the theory. In contrast, acetaldehyde, butanal, methacrolein and especially benzaldehyde show a decrease of their response with dynamic generation. The aldehyde family cannot be adapted for a dynamic generation. These compounds are going to be measured by the calibration with the gas mixture. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as compounds evaluated for their response coefficients in calibration methods. The text indicates that acetone, along with ETBE and other compounds, has a response coefficient that exceeds theoretical expectations, suggesting that both compounds are relevant in the context of calibration methods for gas mixtures. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and ETBE are mentioned together in the context of calibration methods, indicating they share a common application but lack a direct or significant relationship beyond their inclusion in the same analysis.",
        "score": 2
