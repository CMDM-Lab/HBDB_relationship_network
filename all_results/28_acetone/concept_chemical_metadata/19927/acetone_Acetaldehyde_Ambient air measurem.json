    "context": "Fig. 9 represents a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of ambient air compared to an analysis of the standard mixture. Eighteen compounds were quantified including one aromatic compound (toluene), 3 nitriles (pentanenitrile, heptanenitrile and octanenitrile) and 14 OVOC. Table 5 gathers the average concentrations for the quantified compounds, their maximum and minimum. Ethanol, acetone and acetaldehyde showed the highest concentration levels with an average of 2.10, 1.75 and 1.37ppb respectively. Time series plots have shown a correlation with emissions coming from motor vehicle with relatively high concentrations between 6\u20138A.M. and P.M. for three compounds: toluene, ethanol and acetaldehyde (Fig. 10 ). Acetone showed a different temporal trend from toluene, higher concentrations were observed on the early hours of few days (Fig. 10). This temporal variation can be probably attributed to remote sources contribution. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both quantified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient air samples, with acetone showing a higher average concentration than acetaldehyde. The analysis indicates that both compounds are influenced by emissions from motor vehicles, although acetone exhibits a different temporal trend compared to acetaldehyde. This suggests a potential relationship in their sources and environmental behavior, but no direct interaction or metabolic relationship is discussed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both acetone and acetaldehyde are analyzed together in the context of VOC emissions, indicating a shared environmental source. However, their specific interactions or metabolic connections are not explored in detail.",
        "score": 3
