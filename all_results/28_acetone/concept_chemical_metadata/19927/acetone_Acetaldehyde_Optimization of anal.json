    "context": "At <5% RH, no breakthrough was observed even for ethanol and acetonitrile up to 700mL. Nevertheless, at 80% RH breakthrough was apparent for ethanol and acetonitrile at 405mL (Fig. 6b). This can be explained by a decrease of the trapping capacity with humid air for compounds with high water affinity and highlights the importance of using humid standard mixture to define the safe sampling volume. The other compounds showed linear responses for more than 700mL at 80% RH even for acetone and acetaldehyde. The sampling volume was set to 405mL with a GC cycle of 1h and a half for sampling and analyzing. Moreover, ethanol and acetonitrile slopes showed a decrease between dry and humid sample that will be explained in Section 4.2. 3.2.3 ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as compounds that exhibit linear responses during sampling at high relative humidity (RH). The study highlights their behavior in relation to the trapping capacity of humid air, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the analysis of volatile organic compounds under varying humidity conditions. However, the specific interaction or relationship between acetone and acetaldehyde is not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and acetaldehyde are mentioned together in the context of their sampling responses, but there is no detailed discussion of their chemical interaction or functional relationship.",
        "score": 2
