    "context": "Like capsaicin, formalin strongly produced a dose-dependent response. The time\u2013course study suggests that m-xylene, toluene and formalin, as well as capsaicin, were rapidly absorbed into the skin, as the response to each compound peaked within 20min after the initial application. In addition, it is likely that these compounds remained in the skin, as the response to them continued for at least 60min. The other VOCs in this study, n-heptane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, acetone and diethyl ether, had no effect even when unocclusively applied several different times, which corresponded to an approximate 2min occlusive exposure. Our study showed that CP-99,994, which is a tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, completely inhibited the skin microvascular leakage induced by the topical capsaicin and formalin. Previously published reports support our current findings (Moussaoui et al., 1993; Damas and Liegeois, 1999). Furthermore, we also found that CP-99,994 partially inhibited the response induced by topical m-xylene, toluene and styrene. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and cyclohexane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were tested for their effects on skin response. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor cyclohexane produced any significant effect when applied to the skin, suggesting that they do not have a relevant interaction or impact in this specific experimental setup. Their mention is purely as part of a broader investigation into VOCs without any direct relationship or functional significance highlighted.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between acetone and cyclohexane, as both are simply listed among other VOCs tested in the study without any evidence of interaction or relevance to the observed effects.",
        "score": 1
