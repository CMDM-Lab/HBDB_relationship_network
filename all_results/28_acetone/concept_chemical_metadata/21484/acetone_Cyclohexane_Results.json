    "context": "In addition, we did not find any macroscopical blue stains on any of the applied sites. After a topical application of all of the aromatics compounds, m-xylene, toluene, styrene, benzene and ethylbenzene, a significant leakage of the dye into the skin was observed, with the magnitude found to vary among VOC modalities (Fig. 1 ). Formalin also strongly produced a skin response (Fig. 1). However, the other VOCs, which included n-heptane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, acetone and diethyl ether, had no effect on the skin response (Fig. 1), even when repeatedly applied to the skin five times at intervals of 20s in order to confirm the dye leakage measurements.Effects of different doses of the VOCs A topical application of formalin, m-xylene, toluene and styrene produced dye extravasation into the skin in a dose-dependent matter, similar to that seen for capsaicin (Fig. 2 ). The threshold concentrations of formalin, m-xylene, toluene and styrene that induced leakage above the baseline level in the skin were 2.5%, 10%, 33% and 33%, respectively.Time changes in the skin response After a topical application of capsaicin (10mM), formalin (10%), m-xylene (100%), and toluene (100%), there was a noted increase in dye leakage into the skin that peaked during the first 20-min period. Thereafter, this response gradually returned to almost baseline levels (Fig. 3 ). However, a slight but significant level of response to all the chemicals tested, with the exception of for toluene, was found between 60 and 80min after the challenge.Effects of CP-99,994 on the skin response (Figs.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and cyclohexane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were topically applied to the skin. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor cyclohexane produced any significant skin response or dye leakage, unlike other VOCs such as formalin, m-xylene, and toluene. This suggests that both compounds were tested under similar conditions but did not exhibit any notable effects on skin response.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and cyclohexane are both included in the study of VOCs but are not directly related in terms of interaction or effect. Their mention is coincidental within the context of skin response testing.",
