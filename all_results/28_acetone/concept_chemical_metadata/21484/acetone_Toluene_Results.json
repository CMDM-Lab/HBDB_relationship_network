    "context": "In addition, we did not find any macroscopical blue stains on any of the applied sites. After a topical application of all of the aromatics compounds, m-xylene, toluene, styrene, benzene and ethylbenzene, a significant leakage of the dye into the skin was observed, with the magnitude found to vary among VOC modalities (Fig. 1 ). Formalin also strongly produced a skin response (Fig. 1). However, the other VOCs, which included n-heptane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, acetone and diethyl ether, had no effect on the skin response (Fig. 1), even when repeatedly applied to the skin five times at intervals of 20s in order to confirm the dye leakage measurements.Effects of different doses of the VOCs A topical application of formalin, m-xylene, toluene and styrene produced dye extravasation into the skin in a dose-dependent matter, similar to that seen for capsaicin (Fig. 2 ). The threshold concentrations of formalin, m-xylene, toluene and styrene that induced leakage above the baseline level in the skin were 2.5%, 10%, 33% and 33%, respectively.Time changes in the skin response After a topical application of capsaicin (10mM), formalin (10%), m-xylene (100%), and toluene (100%), there was a noted increase in dye leakage into the skin that peaked during the first 20-min period. Thereafter, this response gradually returned to almost baseline levels (Fig. 3 ). However, a slight but significant level of response to all the chemicals tested, with the exception of for toluene, was found between 60 and 80min after the challenge.Effects of CP-99,994 on the skin response (Figs.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) applied topically to assess their effects on skin response. However, while toluene produced a significant dye leakage response, acetone did not show any effect on the skin response, indicating a lack of interaction or comparable biological activity between the two compounds in this specific experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and toluene are both VOCs tested in the same study, but their relationship is limited to their inclusion in the experiment without any direct interaction or significant shared effects on skin response.",
        "score": 2
