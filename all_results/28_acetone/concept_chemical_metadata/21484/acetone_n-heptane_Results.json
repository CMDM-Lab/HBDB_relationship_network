    "context": "In addition, we did not find any macroscopical blue stains on any of the applied sites. After a topical application of all of the aromatics compounds, m-xylene, toluene, styrene, benzene and ethylbenzene, a significant leakage of the dye into the skin was observed, with the magnitude found to vary among VOC modalities (Fig. 1 ). Formalin also strongly produced a skin response (Fig. 1). However, the other VOCs, which included n-heptane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, acetone and diethyl ether, had no effect on the skin response (Fig. 1), even when repeatedly applied to the skin five times at intervals of 20s in order to confirm the dye leakage measurements.Effects of different doses of the VOCs A topical application of formalin, m-xylene, toluene and styrene produced dye extravasation into the skin in a dose-dependent matter, similar to that seen for capsaicin (Fig. 2 ). The threshold concentrations of formalin, m-xylene, toluene and styrene that induced leakage above the baseline level in the skin were 2.5%, 10%, 33% and 33%, respectively.Time changes in the skin response After a topical application of capsaicin (10mM), formalin (10%), m-xylene (100%), and toluene (100%), there was a noted increase in dye leakage into the skin that peaked during the first 20-min period. Thereafter, this response gradually returned to almost baseline levels (Fig. 3 ). However, a slight but significant level of response to all the chemicals tested, with the exception of for toluene, was found between 60 and 80min after the challenge.Effects of CP-99,994 on the skin response (Figs.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and n-heptane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) applied topically to assess their effects on skin response. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor n-heptane produced any significant skin response or dye leakage, suggesting that they do not have a notable interaction or effect in this experimental setup. Their mention is primarily as part of a broader investigation into the effects of various VOCs on skin permeability.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and n-heptane are both included in the study of VOCs but are not shown to interact or have a significant relationship beyond their classification as VOCs with no observed effects on skin response.",
        "score": 2
