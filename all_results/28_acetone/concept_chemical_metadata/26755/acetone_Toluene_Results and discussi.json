    "context": "In \u2018plasma on\u2019 conditions, the toluene signal decreased rapidly from 80 to 60 ppmv; meanwhile, the acetone signal increased instantaneously from 0 to 20 ppmv, but the concentrations of other organic by-products remained 0. Subsequently, both toluene and acetone concentrations decreased, and the concentrations of other species began to increase. The maximum acetone concentration was about 20 ppmv, and, at this point, the removal rate of toluene was 50%; the maximum carbon content in acetone accounted for about 40% of the decomposed toluene. These results suggested that acetone was a major intermediate after the aromatic ring of toluene had been cracked. In other words, most of the toluene formed acetone after the aromatic ring had broken, and, then, the acetone was fragmented into other organic by-products such as methanol, ketene, acetaldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid. Meanwhile, formaldehyde showed a similar trend to that of acetone, but the formation of formaldehyde lagged behind that of acetone, perhaps because formaldehyde is also an intermediate produced by the breakdown of acetone, and, subsequently, formic acid is formed by the oxidation of formaldehyde. The chemical processes involved in the NTP removal of toluene are very complex, and Fig.\u00a08 shows possible decomposition pathways. Under DBD conditions, the mechanism for toluene decomposition can be divided into two pathways. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are directly related through a chemical decomposition process. The study indicates that toluene, when subjected to certain conditions, breaks down to form acetone as a significant intermediate product. The results show that acetone concentration increases as toluene concentration decreases, highlighting a clear transformation pathway where toluene contributes to the formation of acetone, which is then further decomposed into other organic by-products.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as the context explicitly describes the transformation of toluene into acetone during the decomposition process, establishing a critical and direct relationship between the two compounds.",
        "score": 5
