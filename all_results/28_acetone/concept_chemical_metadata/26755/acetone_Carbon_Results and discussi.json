    "context": "However, the processes that occur after the aromatic ring has opened were not discussed. For real-time and on-line VOC quantification, the PTR-TOF-MS instrument was used to measure the concentration of toluene and the organic by-products under \u2018plasma off\u2019 and \u2018plasma on\u2019 conditions (Fig.\u00a07 ). In \u2018plasma on\u2019 conditions, the toluene signal decreased rapidly from 80 to 60 ppmv; meanwhile, the acetone signal increased instantaneously from 0 to 20 ppmv, but the concentrations of other organic by-products remained 0. Subsequently, both toluene and acetone concentrations decreased, and the concentrations of other species began to increase. The maximum acetone concentration was about 20 ppmv, and, at this point, the removal rate of toluene was 50%; the maximum carbon content in acetone accounted for about 40% of the decomposed toluene. These results suggested that acetone was a major intermediate after the aromatic ring of toluene had been cracked. In other words, most of the toluene formed acetone after the aromatic ring had broken, and, then, the acetone was fragmented into other organic by-products such as methanol, ketene, acetaldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid. Meanwhile, formaldehyde showed a similar trend to that of acetone, but the formation of formaldehyde lagged behind that of acetone, perhaps because formaldehyde is also an intermediate produced by the breakdown of acetone, and, subsequently, formic acid is formed by the oxidation of formaldehyde.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant intermediate product formed during the decomposition of toluene, which contains carbon. The study indicates that approximately 40% of the carbon content in acetone originates from the breakdown of toluene's aromatic ring. This highlights a direct relationship where toluene's degradation leads to the formation of acetone, linking both terms through their chemical transformation processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and carbon, as acetone is formed from the carbon content of toluene during its decomposition. The quantitative data provided supports this relationship, indicating a clear chemical interaction.",
