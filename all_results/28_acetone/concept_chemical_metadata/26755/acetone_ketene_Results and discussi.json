    "context": "In \u2018plasma on\u2019 conditions, the toluene signal decreased rapidly from 80 to 60 ppmv; meanwhile, the acetone signal increased instantaneously from 0 to 20 ppmv, but the concentrations of other organic by-products remained 0. Subsequently, both toluene and acetone concentrations decreased, and the concentrations of other species began to increase. The maximum acetone concentration was about 20 ppmv, and, at this point, the removal rate of toluene was 50%; the maximum carbon content in acetone accounted for about 40% of the decomposed toluene. These results suggested that acetone was a major intermediate after the aromatic ring of toluene had been cracked. In other words, most of the toluene formed acetone after the aromatic ring had broken, and, then, the acetone was fragmented into other organic by-products such as methanol, ketene, acetaldehyde, formic acid, and acetic acid. Meanwhile, formaldehyde showed a similar trend to that of acetone, but the formation of formaldehyde lagged behind that of acetone, perhaps because formaldehyde is also an intermediate produced by the breakdown of acetone, and, subsequently, formic acid is formed by the oxidation of formaldehyde. The chemical processes involved in the NTP removal of toluene are very complex, and Fig.\u00a08 shows possible decomposition pathways. Under DBD conditions, the mechanism for toluene decomposition can be divided into two pathways. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant intermediate product formed during the decomposition of toluene. As the aromatic ring of toluene breaks down, acetone is produced, which is then further fragmented into various organic by-products, including ketene. This indicates a direct chemical relationship where acetone is a precursor to ketene in the degradation pathway of toluene.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and ketene, as acetone is shown to be a direct product of toluene decomposition, leading to the formation of ketene among other by-products. The context provides a clear pathway of their relationship.",
