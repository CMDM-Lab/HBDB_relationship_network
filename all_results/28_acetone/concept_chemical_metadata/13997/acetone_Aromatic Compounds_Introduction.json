    "context": "Also, the effect of chlorinated compounds such as chloroform on the performance of BTF treating hydrophobic and hydrophilic VOCs has not been studied. This study attempts to evaluate the performance of a BTF for the treatment of chloroform along with quaternary mixture of VOCs in emissions from pharmaceutical industries. The selected mixture includes representative members of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, with different physical and chemical properties, commonly found in pharmaceutical industries. The compounds employed in the present study include methanol, ethanol (representative of alcohols), acetone (representative of ketones) and toluene (representative of aromatic compounds). The effects of starvation, shutdown and shock loads on performance of BTF were also investigated. Materials 2.1.1 Microorganism and culture media The BTF was inoculated with a mixed microbial consortium previously utilized for the biodegradation of various groups of pesticides (lindane, methyl parathion, carbofuran) by Ramakrishna and Philip (2009) and for biodegradation of various groups of VOCs (alcohols, ketones, aromatics, chlorinated solvents) by Balasubramanian et al. (2011). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a representative member of ketones, while toluene is noted as a representative of aromatic compounds within a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being treated in a biotrickling filter (BTF). The study aims to evaluate the performance of the BTF on various VOCs, including both ketones and aromatic compounds, but does not detail any specific interactions or relationships between acetone and aromatic compounds beyond their classification within the mixture.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and aromatic compounds are mentioned in the same context of VOCs being treated, but their relationship is not explored in detail. They are categorized together without direct interaction or functional significance.",
