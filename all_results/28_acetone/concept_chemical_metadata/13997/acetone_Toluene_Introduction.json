    "context": "Also, the effect of chlorinated compounds such as chloroform on the performance of BTF treating hydrophobic and hydrophilic VOCs has not been studied. This study attempts to evaluate the performance of a BTF for the treatment of chloroform along with quaternary mixture of VOCs in emissions from pharmaceutical industries. The selected mixture includes representative members of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, with different physical and chemical properties, commonly found in pharmaceutical industries. The compounds employed in the present study include methanol, ethanol (representative of alcohols), acetone (representative of ketones) and toluene (representative of aromatic compounds). The effects of starvation, shutdown and shock loads on performance of BTF were also investigated. Materials 2.1.1 Microorganism and culture media The BTF was inoculated with a mixed microbial consortium previously utilized for the biodegradation of various groups of pesticides (lindane, methyl parathion, carbofuran) by Ramakrishna and Philip (2009) and for biodegradation of various groups of VOCs (alcohols, ketones, aromatics, chlorinated solvents) by Balasubramanian et al. (2011). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both included as components of a volatile organic compound (VOC) mixture used in a biotrickling filter (BTF) study aimed at treating emissions from pharmaceutical industries. Acetone represents ketones, while toluene represents aromatic compounds, highlighting their roles in the broader category of VOCs. However, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as part of the mixture.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and toluene are mentioned together in the context of a VOC mixture, indicating they share a general category but lack detailed discussion of their direct relationship or interactions.",
