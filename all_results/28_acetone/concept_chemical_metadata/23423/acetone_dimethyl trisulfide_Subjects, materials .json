    "context": "For each compound 6 different concentrations (5 repeated measurements) were used: 8, 4, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.05mg/L for indole, dimethyl trisulfide, 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, 1-propanol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, skatole, allyl methyl sulfide, dimethyl selenide and carbon disulfide and 480, 240, 120, 90, 60 and 45mg/L for acetone. Each calibration curve was set up using the calibration tool of the Chemstation software (Agilent Technologies)(X-axis: concentration of the compound, Y-axis: response, i.e. peak area of a chosen target ion in the mass spectrum of each compound). For each compound one target ion and at least two qualifier ions were used for identification and quantification. The following target and qualifier ions were used: for indole (117, 90, 89), dimethyl trisulfide (126, 111, 79), 2-butanone (43, 72, 57), 2-pentanone (43, 86, 71, 58) 1-propanol (31, 59, 42), dimethyl sulfide (62, 47, 45), dimethyl disulfide (94, 79, 45), skatole (130, 131, 77), allyl methyl sulfide (88, 73, 41), dimethyl selenide (110, 95, 92), carbon disulfide (76, 78, 44) and acetone (43, 58, 42). The percentage uncertainty, which defines the acceptable range for the relative response of the qualifier ions, was set at 20% relative to the relative response of the calibrator. Based on the calibration curve, the concentration of each compound was automatically calculated in both breath and environmental samples and a conversion to parts per billion per volume (ppbv or nmol/mol) in air was made. In each sample and for each compound, quality of quantification was checked using the \u2018QEdit quantitation results tool\u2019 of the Chemstation software. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethyl trisulfide are both analyzed as compounds in a calibration study for quantification in breath and environmental samples. They are included in a list of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at different concentrations, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them. Their mention is primarily related to their quantification methods rather than any biological or chemical interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and dimethyl trisulfide are both part of a calibration process for VOCs, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
