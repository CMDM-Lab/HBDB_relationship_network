    "context": "For dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, carbon disulfide and 2-butanone negative concentration values were obtained for some volunteers after subtraction of the environmental sample. Acetone showed the highest concentration. Six compounds were common to all volunteers in alveolar air and four compounds in mouth air. A significant difference between alveolar air and mouth air was found for acetone (p <0.001), 2-pentanone (p <0.001), dimethyl selenide (p <0.001), 1-propanol (p <0.001), dimethyl sulphide (p <0.001), dimethyl disulphide (p <0.001), dimethyl trisulphide (p =0.003) and allyl methyl sulfide (p <0.001). For every compound there was a positive correlation between alveolar air and mouth air. For acetone, 2-pentanone, indole, dimethyl disulphide, carbon disulphide and allyl methyl sulfide this correlation was strong (R \u22650.66). For 1-propanol, the correlation was weak (R \u22640.33).

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethylselenide are both mentioned as volatile compounds detected in alveolar and mouth air samples from volunteers. A significant difference in concentration was noted for both compounds, indicating they are part of the same study on breath analysis. However, their specific interaction or functional relationship is not discussed, limiting the depth of their connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and dimethylselenide are both analyzed in the same breath study, but there is no detailed discussion of their interaction or significance beyond their presence in the samples.",
        "score": 2
