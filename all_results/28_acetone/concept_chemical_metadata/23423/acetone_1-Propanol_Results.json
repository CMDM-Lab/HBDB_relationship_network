    "context": "For dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, carbon disulfide and 2-butanone negative concentration values were obtained for some volunteers after subtraction of the environmental sample. Acetone showed the highest concentration. Six compounds were common to all volunteers in alveolar air and four compounds in mouth air. A significant difference between alveolar air and mouth air was found for acetone (p <0.001), 2-pentanone (p <0.001), dimethyl selenide (p <0.001), 1-propanol (p <0.001), dimethyl sulphide (p <0.001), dimethyl disulphide (p <0.001), dimethyl trisulphide (p =0.003) and allyl methyl sulfide (p <0.001). For every compound there was a positive correlation between alveolar air and mouth air. For acetone, 2-pentanone, indole, dimethyl disulphide, carbon disulphide and allyl methyl sulfide this correlation was strong (R \u22650.66). For 1-propanol, the correlation was weak (R \u22640.33).

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and 1-propanol are both volatile organic compounds measured in alveolar and mouth air samples from volunteers. A significant difference in concentration was noted between alveolar and mouth air for both compounds, indicating their presence in breath analysis. However, the correlation between acetone and 1-propanol was weak (R \u22640.33), suggesting limited direct interaction or relationship in terms of their metabolic or physiological significance despite being part of the same study.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both acetone and 1-propanol are analyzed in the same breath study, showing significant differences in concentration. However, the weak correlation indicates that their relationship is not strong or direct, limiting their interaction significance.",
        "score": 3
