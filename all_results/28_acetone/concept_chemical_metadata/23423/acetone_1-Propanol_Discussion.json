    "context": "Breath samples were also taken at least 30min after consumption of any food or beverages and before lunch. Due to some technical difficulties of the methodology used (e.g. high water content), there might be a slight underestimation of the detected concentrations. However, acetone and propanol concentrations for example were very close to the detected normal range of previous studies. It is important to take into account that the threshold to smell differs according to the type of gas. Some gases can cause a striking odor at very low concentrations while others need to be present in much higher quantities to give a noticeable odor. This is important for drawing conclusions regarding the origin of halitosis whether with an intra or extra-oral cause when using an organoleptic approach. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and 1-Propanol are both mentioned as volatile compounds detected in breath samples, with their concentrations being close to the normal range established in previous studies. The discussion focuses on the challenges of measuring these compounds accurately due to methodological issues, but does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between acetone and 1-Propanol. Their mention is primarily in the context of breath analysis and odor detection thresholds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and 1-Propanol are both discussed in relation to breath analysis but without any direct interaction or significant relationship detailed in the context. They are simply noted as similar in concentration levels.",
        "score": 2
