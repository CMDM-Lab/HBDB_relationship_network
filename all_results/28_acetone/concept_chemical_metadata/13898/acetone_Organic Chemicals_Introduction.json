    "context": "This poly(l-Asp) derivative enables the ready removal of organic solvent during the micelle fabrication process and provides functionality that can respond to a slightly acidic pH (i.e., pHe). The DOX-loaded poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG micelles showed pH-stimulated drug release patterns: a significantly accelerated DOX release at pH 6.8 and a minimized DOX release at pH 7.4. This multifunctionality of poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP68)-b-PEG is expected to provide efficient strategies and applications for the biomedical field. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like dichloromethane, acetone and ethyl formate are widely used in the oil sands process to extract the bitumen from the oil sands. Acetone and ethyl formate have adverse toxic effects on human central nervous system and environment. And dichloromethane even causes cancer to humans and so the European States have decided to ban the use of it for concentration equal to or greater than 0.1 by mass percent. This research work focuses on the removal of VOCs by adsorption using commercial microporous activated carbon and then regenerates the adsorbed phase. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of organic chemicals. The text discusses the use of acetone, along with other VOCs, in industrial processes such as bitumen extraction from oil sands. It highlights the toxic effects of acetone on human health and the environment, linking it to the regulatory concerns surrounding organic chemicals. However, the relationship is primarily categorical, with acetone being one example of many organic chemicals mentioned.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone is categorized as an organic chemical, but there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or significance beyond its classification as a VOC.",
