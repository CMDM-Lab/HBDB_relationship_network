    "context": "Median concentrations were 3.3, 2.3 and 1.5 ppbC, respectively, and did not vary much with time thereby indicating fresh emissions throughout the day. Concentrations were typically no more than twice as high in the 10.00 h and 12.00 h samples as compared to earlier samples. Atmospheric photochemistry contributes to the consumption of formaldehyde and the production of acetaldehyde and acetone. This was demonstrated at Winn Road and Turf Road by acetone being the most abundant species (five times that of 20/30 Club) followed by acetaldehyde (about the same level at the three sites) and formaldehyde (approx. half that of 20/30 Club). A few significant concentrations of benzaldehyde and methyl-ethyl ketone, ranging up to 4 and 5 ppbC, respectively, were observed at Winn Road and Turf Road. Acrolein, crotonaldehyde, and tolualdehyde were below detection at all ground samples and the other carbonyls were less than 1 ppbC for the three sites.Ambient aloft samples Distributions of TNMHC by time of day and site for the 56 aloft samples are shown in Fig. 5 with the nearest ground level sites labeled in the middle of each respective graph.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both identified as products of atmospheric photochemistry, with acetone being the most abundant species observed at the sampling sites, significantly higher than acetaldehyde. Their concentrations are linked through the processes that govern their formation and degradation in the atmosphere, indicating a direct relationship in terms of their chemical behavior and environmental presence.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and acetaldehyde, as both are products of atmospheric reactions and their concentrations are discussed in relation to each other. The context provides evidence of their relative abundances, indicating a clear relationship in the chemical processes involved.",
        "score": 4
