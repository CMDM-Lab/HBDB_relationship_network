    "context": "Ju\u00e1rez. The concentrations and composition of VOCs at the background site on the Franklin Mountains showed impact from urban emissions. TNMHC aloft was overall 5 times lower in concentration than at the surface with a similar, but aged, composition. Higher concentrations (up to 32 ppbC), a mid-day maximum, and a different species distribution (acetone more abundant than formaldehyde) reflected photochemical as well as vehicular origins of the carbonyl compounds at two suburban sites in El Paso. Total carbonyl concentrations at the urban location in Cd. Ju\u00e1rez were lower, from 4 to 16 ppbC, and did not vary much. Although carbonyl compounds were not a major portion of TNMOC at the surface (no more than 4%), they contributed 14% of TNMOC aloft, the same as aromatics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to the overall composition of carbonyl compounds in urban emissions. The study highlights that acetone is more abundant than formaldehyde among the carbonyl compounds measured, indicating its significant presence in the atmospheric composition. This suggests a direct relationship where acetone is classified as a type of carbonyl compound, reflecting its role in urban air quality and pollution studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and carbonyl compounds, as acetone is explicitly mentioned as a prominent carbonyl compound in the context of urban emissions. The data supports its classification and relevance in atmospheric studies.",
        "score": 4
