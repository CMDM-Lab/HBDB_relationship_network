    "context": "Furthermore, the sensor signal (response) was robust against variation in gas (or breath) flow rates down to 0.2L min\u22121 facilitating application of such sensors in real breath measurement conditions. These sensors were applied to breath acetone monitoring of five different test persons and were in agreement (>98%) to high-sensitivity PTR-MS measurements of the same breath samples. The breath acetone concentrations measured by the Si:WO3 sensors had very high signal to noise ratio (60) and the response time was about 27s. The Si:WO3 sensors were selective to acetone both at rest and during physical activity, independently of the respiratory pace or presence of isoprene that is associated with physical activity. Furthermore, these sensors also responded very rapidly to short breath pulses further supporting their potential for breath analysis. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are defined as organic compounds with high vapor pressure that are easily vaporized under ambient temperature and pressure conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of VOCs includes all organic compounds or substances that are made up predominantly carbon and hydrogen with boiling temperatures in the range of 50\u2013260\u00b0C, excluding pesticides.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to breath analysis. The study highlights the ability of sensors to monitor breath acetone concentrations effectively, while also noting the presence of isoprene, which is associated with physical activity. However, the relationship between acetone and isoprene is not deeply explored, as the focus is primarily on the sensor's performance in detecting acetone, independent of isoprene's influence.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and isoprene are both classified as VOCs and mentioned in the context of breath analysis, but their specific interaction or functional relationship is not detailed.",
