    "context": "The six rectangle planes come in three congruent pairs, i.e., XY, YZ and XZ (Table 1), respectively. Therefore, they could possibly enter into pores of MIL-101 with one of the three congruent rectangle pairs. Adsorption capacity of VOCs by filling into pores of MIL-101 is dependent on the length of diagonal line of the molecular rectangle plane (i.e., the diameter of circumcircle of the plane including D XY , D YZ and D XZ listed in Table 3) by which VOC molecules entered into MIL-101 pores since VOC molecules cannot enter into pores whose diameters smaller than the diameter of VOC molecule plane. Mostly, VOC molecules, such as acetone, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene, enter into MIL-101 pores with the plane having the minimum diameter (i.e., YZ plane of acetone and XY plane of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene), showing that V\u2212 V YZ value of acetone and V\u2212 V XY values of toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene are respectively equal to their V a values (Table 3). However, V a values of o-xylene and m-xylene are respectively equal to their V\u2212 V XZ values, implying that they fill into MIL-101 pores with the XZ plane (i.e., the plane having maximum diameter) (Table 3). A possible reason is that methyl groups of xylene molecules, prior to their benzene ring, interact with active sites of MIL-101, and thus, o-xylene and m-xylene could not fill into the pores with diameters smaller than their D XZ (i.e., the diameter of the maximum plane of o-xylene and m-xylene which depends on the distance between the two methyl groups) as shown in Fig. 5 . However, the two methyl groups in p-xylene, linking benzene ring with an angle of about 180\u00b0, form a line-type structure, and which allow p-xylene molecules, as similar to ethylbenzene molecules, to enter into MIL-101 pores with diameters larger than D XY as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, volume adsorption capacity of p-xylene in MIL-101 was higher than that of m-xylene and o-xylene (Fig. 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can enter the pores of MIL-101, a metal-organic framework, based on its molecular dimensions. However, N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is not discussed in relation to acetone or the adsorption process. Therefore, there is no direct or implied relationship between acetone and LSD in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that acetone and N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide are mentioned in the same context, but there is no discussion or evidence of any relationship between them. They appear coincidentally without any functional or chemical relevance.",
