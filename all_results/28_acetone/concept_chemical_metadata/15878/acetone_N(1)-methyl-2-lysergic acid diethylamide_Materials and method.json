    "context": "Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken at 80kV by a JEM-1230 (JEOL Corp., Japan). The thermal stability of MIL-101 was investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) with SDT Q600 (AT Corp., USA) by using approximate 7.3mg sample from 35\u00b0C to 605\u00b0C with a ramping rate of 2.0\u00b0C/min in air atmosphere. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum was determined using Bruker-vector-22 (German) with a range of 500\u20134000cm\u22121. MIL-101 sample for FT-IR analysis was pretreated by grinding power of MIL-101 together with KBr in an agate mortar and then by pressing them into flakes by a tablet machine.Adsorption measurements The vapor-phase adsorptions of BETXs and acetone were carried out at 25\u00b0C on a volumetric adsorption apparatus, i.e., Autosorb-1MP-VP (Quantachrome Corp., USA). This apparatus was modified with an additional organic vapor generation system and a heating system. The VOC vapors were generated by the vapor generation system at 50\u00b0C. The constant adsorption temperature was achieved by putting sample cell into water bath in Dewar flask. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) involved in vapor-phase adsorption measurements, while N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide (commonly known as LSD) is not directly referenced in relation to acetone. The context primarily focuses on the thermal stability and adsorption characteristics of MIL-101, with acetone being one of the substances analyzed. There is no evident interaction or relationship between acetone and LSD in the provided information.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between acetone and N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any direct connection or interaction discussed.",
