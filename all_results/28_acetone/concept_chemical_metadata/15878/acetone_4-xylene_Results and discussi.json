    "context": "The six rectangle planes come in three congruent pairs, i.e., XY, YZ and XZ (Table 1), respectively. Therefore, they could possibly enter into pores of MIL-101 with one of the three congruent rectangle pairs. Adsorption capacity of VOCs by filling into pores of MIL-101 is dependent on the length of diagonal line of the molecular rectangle plane (i.e., the diameter of circumcircle of the plane including D XY , D YZ and D XZ listed in Table 3) by which VOC molecules entered into MIL-101 pores since VOC molecules cannot enter into pores whose diameters smaller than the diameter of VOC molecule plane. Mostly, VOC molecules, such as acetone, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene, enter into MIL-101 pores with the plane having the minimum diameter (i.e., YZ plane of acetone and XY plane of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene), showing that V\u2212 V YZ value of acetone and V\u2212 V XY values of toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene are respectively equal to their V a values (Table 3). However, V a values of o-xylene and m-xylene are respectively equal to their V\u2212 V XZ values, implying that they fill into MIL-101 pores with the XZ plane (i.e., the plane having maximum diameter) (Table 3). A possible reason is that methyl groups of xylene molecules, prior to their benzene ring, interact with active sites of MIL-101, and thus, o-xylene and m-xylene could not fill into the pores with diameters smaller than their D XZ (i.e., the diameter of the maximum plane of o-xylene and m-xylene which depends on the distance between the two methyl groups) as shown in Fig. 5 . However, the two methyl groups in p-xylene, linking benzene ring with an angle of about 180\u00b0, form a line-type structure, and which allow p-xylene molecules, as similar to ethylbenzene molecules, to enter into MIL-101 pores with diameters larger than D XY as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, volume adsorption capacity of p-xylene in MIL-101 was higher than that of m-xylene and o-xylene (Fig. 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that interact with the porous material MIL-101. The study discusses how the molecular dimensions of these VOCs influence their ability to enter the pores of MIL-101, with acetone and 4-xylene having different adsorption capacities based on their molecular structures. However, the specific interactions between acetone and 4-xylene are not elaborated upon, focusing instead on their individual behaviors in relation to the material's pore structure.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both acetone and 4-xylene are discussed in the context of their adsorption properties in MIL-101, indicating a shared significance in the study. However, their direct relationship or interaction is not explicitly detailed.",
