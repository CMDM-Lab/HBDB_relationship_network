    "context": "The six rectangle planes come in three congruent pairs, i.e., XY, YZ and XZ (Table 1), respectively. Therefore, they could possibly enter into pores of MIL-101 with one of the three congruent rectangle pairs. Adsorption capacity of VOCs by filling into pores of MIL-101 is dependent on the length of diagonal line of the molecular rectangle plane (i.e., the diameter of circumcircle of the plane including D XY , D YZ and D XZ listed in Table 3) by which VOC molecules entered into MIL-101 pores since VOC molecules cannot enter into pores whose diameters smaller than the diameter of VOC molecule plane. Mostly, VOC molecules, such as acetone, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene, enter into MIL-101 pores with the plane having the minimum diameter (i.e., YZ plane of acetone and XY plane of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene), showing that V\u2212 V YZ value of acetone and V\u2212 V XY values of toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene are respectively equal to their V a values (Table 3). However, V a values of o-xylene and m-xylene are respectively equal to their V\u2212 V XZ values, implying that they fill into MIL-101 pores with the XZ plane (i.e., the plane having maximum diameter) (Table 3). A possible reason is that methyl groups of xylene molecules, prior to their benzene ring, interact with active sites of MIL-101, and thus, o-xylene and m-xylene could not fill into the pores with diameters smaller than their D XZ (i.e., the diameter of the maximum plane of o-xylene and m-xylene which depends on the distance between the two methyl groups) as shown in Fig. 5 . However, the two methyl groups in p-xylene, linking benzene ring with an angle of about 180\u00b0, form a line-type structure, and which allow p-xylene molecules, as similar to ethylbenzene molecules, to enter into MIL-101 pores with diameters larger than D XY as shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, volume adsorption capacity of p-xylene in MIL-101 was higher than that of m-xylene and o-xylene (Fig. 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can enter the pores of MIL-101, a metal-organic framework. The adsorption capacity of these VOCs is influenced by their molecular dimensions, specifically the diagonal lengths of their rectangle planes. While both compounds are discussed in relation to their ability to be adsorbed, there is no detailed interaction or comparison between them beyond their shared property as VOCs entering the same material.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and toluene are both identified as VOCs relevant to the adsorption study, but their relationship is not explored in detail beyond their commonality in the context of MIL-101.",
