    "context": "Moreover, only the nonpolar VOCs (i.e., C3H8, benzene, toluene, n-alkanes, xylene isomers, ethylbenzene and n-butane) were examined for their adsorption by MIL-101 in previous studies [22,24\u201330]. Polar VOCs (such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, tetrachloroethane, methyl chloride, various chlorohydrocarbons and perfluorocarbons) were also environmentally concerned pollutants in air due to their high toxicity and volatility. However, adsorption characteristics of these polar VOCs by MIL-101 were still not examined. Therefore, in this study, polar acetone and nonpolar BTEXs with various sizes and shapes were selected as adsorbates to examine the adsorption performance of MIL-101 towards polar and nonpolar VOCs as well as the influences of VOC molecular properties. We also hope to establish the relationships between molecule properties of VOCs and their adsorption on MIL-101, and to explore the underlying adsorption mechanisms. Chemicals Chromium nitrate nonahydrates (99+%), terephthalic acid (TPA) (99+%) and fluorhydric acid (HF) (40+%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China), Acros organic (USA) and Juhua Reagent Co., Ltd. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a polar volatile organic compound (VOC) that is being examined for its adsorption characteristics by MIL-101, while N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide (commonly known as LSD) is not directly discussed. The focus is on the adsorption performance of MIL-101 towards various VOCs, including acetone, but there is no explicit relationship or interaction established between acetone and LSD within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between acetone and N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide, as they are mentioned in different contexts without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other.",
