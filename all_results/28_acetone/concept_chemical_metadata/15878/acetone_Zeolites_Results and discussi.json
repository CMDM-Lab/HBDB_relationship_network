    "context": "Another evidence of the slow diffusion and the un-equilibrium of adsorption of ethylbenzene and xylenes is that their desorption isotherms are a litter higher than their adsorption isotherms at P/P 0 >0.1, while the desorption isotherm of acetone with smaller size is almost the same with its adsorption isotherm (Fig. S1 in Supporting Information). Isotherms of acetone, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes show that adsorption of these VOCs on MIL-101 reached a plateau approximately at P/P 0 >0.2 (Fig. 2). The plateau values (i.e., saturated adsorption capacity) are listed in Table 2 . MIL-101 shows the highest adsorption capacity for these VOCs as compared with other commonly utilized adsorbents such as zeolites, resins, activated carbon together with their derivatives [11,24,30,36\u201344] (Table 2), indicating that MIL-101 is a potential superior adsorbent for the sorptive removal of unwanted VOCs such as polar acetone and apolar BTEXs from contaminated air. For example, the saturated adsorption capacity of benzene on MIL-101 in this study was estimated to be 1291\u00b177mg/g (i.e., 16.4mmol/g) at P/P 0 =0.55\u00b10.05, which is close to the reported value (16.7mmol/g) of benzene on MIL-101 at P/P 0 =0.5 in a previous study but higher than the saturated adsorption capacity of benzene on HY zeolite (3.3mmol/g), whose specific surface area is one of the largest among the aluminosilicate zeolites, and a pitch-based activated carbon (12.4mmol/g, the maximum value was reported in the literatures for benzene on adsorbents except for MIL-101).Influence of VOC structure on their adsorption into MIL-101 and the underlying adsorption mechanisms A negative linear relationship between the volume adsorption capacity (V a) of selected VOCs at P/P 0 =0.55\u00b10.05 (Table 3 ) and their molecular cross-sectional area (i.e., the total area of the orthographic projection of a molecule where the molecular geometry is accepted as a sphere) in Table 1 was established (Fig. 3 ).

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and zeolites are compared in terms of their adsorption capacities for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights that MIL-101, a metal-organic framework, exhibits superior adsorption capacity for acetone compared to zeolites and other adsorbents. While zeolites are mentioned as commonly utilized adsorbents, the focus is on the performance of MIL-101, indicating that zeolites have a lower capacity for acetone adsorption. This suggests a relationship where zeolites serve as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of MIL-101 in removing acetone from contaminated air.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone is discussed in relation to zeolites in the context of adsorption capacities. However, the relationship is primarily comparative rather than indicating a direct interaction or functional relationship.",
