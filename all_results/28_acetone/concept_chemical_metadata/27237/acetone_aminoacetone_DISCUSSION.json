    "context": "[2] Four bacterial proteins, whose physiological role has not been elucidated, share similar tertiary structure composed of three domains: an \u00ce\u00b1/\u00ce\u00b2 domain corresponding to the FAD-binding domain, a \u00ce\u00b2-domain which partially modulates accessibility to the coenzyme, and an additional \u00ce\u00b1-domain. [3] Phylogenetic analysis confirms that SoAAO homologues are present in microorganisms belonging to the genus Streptococcus [] and that they are also widespread in bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria phyla with a sequence identity between SoAAO and homologues ranging from 30% to 45% (considering the overall sequence). [4] SoAAO homologues were also identified in Viridiplantae (green plants) although with a lower degree of identity with SoAAO (~25%) (see Supplementary Figure S7). [1] The O-methylglycine molecule bound to SoAAO provides a useful molecular scaffold to mimic the binding mode of aminoacetone, which differs from O-methylglycine only in the substitution of the ester group by a methyl ketone (Figure 5E). [2] From a structural standpoint, SoAAO does not resemble known LAAOs, since classic LAAOs are homodimeric holoenzymes (the main exception being those from E. coli and Sulfolobus tokodaii) [], whereas SoAAO is monomeric, and LAAO belongs to the N-terminal FAD-bound reductase family while SoAAO is a three-domain protein. [3] LAAOs evolved an active-site arrangement to bind L-amino acids and to discriminate between the two different enantiomers, the so-called four-location model []. [4] In all cases, the substrate binds to the LAAO active site on the re-face of the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD, with the major interactions being: (i) a salt bridge between the \u00ce\u00b1-COO\u00e2\u02c6\u2019 of the amino acid and the guanidinium group of an arginine residue located close to the pyrimidine-derivative ring of the isoalloxazine moiety; this interaction is strengthened by an additional hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of a tyrosine residue; (ii) a hydrogen bond between the \u00ce\u00b1-amino group of the L-amino acid and the main-chain C=O of the protein belonging to a small residue (glycine or alanine); (iii) the third anchor point is formed by the region of the active site located above the hydrophobic moiety of the FAD isoalloxazine ring: this latter region accommodates the substrate side chain and represents the main structural determinant of substrate specificities observed in the various LAAOs [].

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and aminoacetone are related through their structural similarities, as aminoacetone is described as differing from O-methylglycine only by the substitution of the ester group with a methyl ketone, which is a characteristic of acetone. The discussion highlights the binding mode of aminoacetone in relation to the SoAAO protein, suggesting a biochemical connection between the two compounds, particularly in the context of enzyme interactions and substrate specificity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone and aminoacetone are connected through their structural relationship and potential interactions with the SoAAO protein, but the context does not provide extensive details on their functional relationship or specific biochemical roles.",
