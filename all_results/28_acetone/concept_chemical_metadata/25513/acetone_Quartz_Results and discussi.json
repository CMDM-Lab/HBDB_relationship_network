    "context": "For gas chromatographic analysis of pentachlorophenol, this compound was derivatized to the anisole by reaction with diazomethane or converted to the acetylated compound by acetic anhydride in order to avoid adsorption of the compound at the injection port and analytical column. Otake et al. reported that the analysis of phosphates was imprecise when GC\u2013MS was used, even if internal standardization was employed. The gas chromatographic analysis of thermolabile pyrethroids in insecticidal pyrethrum extract and in insecticide formulations was achieved by on-column injection with hydrogen as the carrier gas at high velocities and with short thin-film capillaries in order to avoid thermal degradation.Contamination of adsorbents and procedure blank during sample preparation Pre-cleaning of the adsorbents, quartz fiber filter disk and Empore disk, before sampling is mandatory as they are contaminated with various materials at the time of purchase. Therefore, the Empore disks were washed with acetone and quartz fiber filter disks heated at 400\u00b0C were employed for SVOC sampling during the present study. Ten-milliliter centrifuge tubes containing one each of a cleaned quartz fiber filter disk and a heated Empore disk without sampling, were analyzed immediately by the present method. The amounts of SVOCs detected are shown in Table 4 . Diethyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate and di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate were detected in the adsorbents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is used as a cleaning agent for quartz fiber filter disks prior to sampling, indicating a procedural relationship where acetone is employed to remove contaminants from the quartz material. However, there is no discussion of any chemical interaction or biological relevance between acetone and quartz beyond this cleaning process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone is utilized in the preparation of quartz filters, but there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or any significant functional interaction in the context provided.",
