    "context": "For gas chromatographic analysis of pentachlorophenol, this compound was derivatized to the anisole by reaction with diazomethane or converted to the acetylated compound by acetic anhydride in order to avoid adsorption of the compound at the injection port and analytical column. Otake et al. reported that the analysis of phosphates was imprecise when GC\u2013MS was used, even if internal standardization was employed. The gas chromatographic analysis of thermolabile pyrethroids in insecticidal pyrethrum extract and in insecticide formulations was achieved by on-column injection with hydrogen as the carrier gas at high velocities and with short thin-film capillaries in order to avoid thermal degradation.Contamination of adsorbents and procedure blank during sample preparation Pre-cleaning of the adsorbents, quartz fiber filter disk and Empore disk, before sampling is mandatory as they are contaminated with various materials at the time of purchase. Therefore, the Empore disks were washed with acetone and quartz fiber filter disks heated at 400\u00b0C were employed for SVOC sampling during the present study. Ten-milliliter centrifuge tubes containing one each of a cleaned quartz fiber filter disk and a heated Empore disk without sampling, were analyzed immediately by the present method. The amounts of SVOCs detected are shown in Table 4 . Diethyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate and di(2-ethylhexyl)adipate were detected in the adsorbents. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is used as a cleaning agent for Empore disks, which are employed in the sampling process for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). The washing of Empore disks with acetone is necessary to remove contaminants that may interfere with the analysis. This indicates a practical relationship where acetone serves a preparatory role in ensuring the integrity of the sampling process involving Empore disks.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as acetone is directly involved in the preparation of Empore disks for sampling, indicating a functional relationship. However, the context does not delve into any deeper biochemical or physiological interactions between the two.",
