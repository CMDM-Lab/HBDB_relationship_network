    "context": "The two adsorbents, quartz fiber filter disk and Empore disk, packed in the sampler were removed together into a 10ml centrifuge tube. The tube was wrapped with aluminum foil and stored at 4\u00b0C in a refrigerator until analysis. A sampler containing the two adsorbents without the SVOC sample was used as a travel blank.Target SVOCs The compounds analyzed were the 73 SVOCs shown in Table 1, namely 21 plasticizers and flame retardants, 36 insecticides, 3 synergists and 13 fungicides. These were compounds which were expected to be detected in indoor air based on information on the use of chemicals [28\u201330] and our survey of marketed products.Mixed SVOC stock solution and internal standard solution Each stock standard solution of 68 SVOCs except for propetamphos, MGK-264, resmethrin, hydramethynon and thiabendazole was prepared with 10.0mg/ml of each compound by dissolving it in acetone in 10ml brown high-airtight vials (Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan). Solutions of propetamphos, MGK-264, resmethrin and hydramethylnon were prepared at 5.0mg/ml, and that of thiabendazole at 2.0mg/ml, as for the above 68 SVOCs. Aliquots of these stock standard solutions were combined, and the mixed SVOC stock solution of 73 compounds was prepared at 123.5\u03bcg/ml in another 10ml brown high-airtight vial. A solution of the internal standard, fluoranthene-d10, was prepared at 100\u03bcg/ml by dissolving the compound in acetone in a 2ml brown high-airtight vial. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a solvent used to prepare stock standard solutions of various semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). It serves as a medium for dissolving these chemicals, indicating its role as a chemical in analytical procedures. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or relationships with the other chemicals listed, which include plasticizers, insecticides, and fungicides.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone is used as a solvent for preparing solutions of various chemicals, but there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between acetone and the other chemicals in the context.",
