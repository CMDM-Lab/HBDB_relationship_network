    "context": "From this standpoint, butan-1.3-diol and butan-2.3-diol showed the highest correlation coefficients with the earthy attribute, with r 2 values of around 0.86 (Fig. 2 ). Conversely, among the five compounds that were associated with cool climatic conditions (ethanal, 2-methylfuran, butan-2-one, acetone and dimethylsulfide), butan-2-one was negatively correlated with the earthy attribute, while ethanal (Fig. 2) was associated with the fruity attribute. Moreover, some volatile compounds that were not clearly correlated with the climatic parameters recorded, such as ethanol, 2-furanmethanol, hexanal, 2-methylpropan-1-ol, 3-methylfuran and toluene, presented close correlations with body, acidity and bitterness attributes. Finally, pyrrole, which was shown to be correlated with temperature during wet processing, was associated with weak aroma quality, acidity and overall quality. To draw up a summary representation of our results, the sensory analysis variability structure was analysed by principal component analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethyl sulfide are mentioned as volatile compounds associated with cool climatic conditions. They are part of a group of compounds analyzed for their correlation with sensory attributes, but the context does not provide specific details on their interactions or functional relationships. Their mention is primarily in relation to their sensory characteristics rather than any direct biochemical or physiological relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as acetone and dimethyl sulfide are grouped together based on their association with climatic conditions, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or significance beyond this general categorization.",
