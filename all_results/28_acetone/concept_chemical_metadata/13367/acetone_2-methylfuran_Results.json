    "context": "From this standpoint, butan-1.3-diol and butan-2.3-diol showed the highest correlation coefficients with the earthy attribute, with r 2 values of around 0.86 (Fig. 2 ). Conversely, among the five compounds that were associated with cool climatic conditions (ethanal, 2-methylfuran, butan-2-one, acetone and dimethylsulfide), butan-2-one was negatively correlated with the earthy attribute, while ethanal (Fig. 2) was associated with the fruity attribute. Moreover, some volatile compounds that were not clearly correlated with the climatic parameters recorded, such as ethanol, 2-furanmethanol, hexanal, 2-methylpropan-1-ol, 3-methylfuran and toluene, presented close correlations with body, acidity and bitterness attributes. Finally, pyrrole, which was shown to be correlated with temperature during wet processing, was associated with weak aroma quality, acidity and overall quality. To draw up a summary representation of our results, the sensory analysis variability structure was analysed by principal component analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and 2-methylfuran are mentioned as volatile compounds associated with specific climatic conditions. While both are part of a group of compounds analyzed for their sensory attributes, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between acetone and 2-methylfuran. Instead, they are listed among other compounds with varying correlations to sensory attributes, indicating a shared category but lacking detailed interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as acetone and 2-methylfuran are both volatile compounds analyzed in relation to sensory attributes influenced by climatic conditions. However, there is no specific discussion of their relationship or interaction.",
