    "context": "The collected sample is subsequently transferred to the purge and trap apparatus for concentration and then is analyzed by the appropriate analytical systems, e.g., GC, GC/MS, etc. The objectives of this work were twofold: first, simplification of the sampling apparatus and second, determination of the relationship between the concentration of VOCs and their time variations. One way to simplify would be to omit the SPME which is expensive and complicated when coupled with GC. To that end the design and applicability of PSM combined with P&T followed by GC\u2013FID was investigated in the analysis of 17 VOCs, e.g., chloroform, toluene, naphthalene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, bromodichloromethane, tetrachloroethylene and acetone (Table 1 ), in waste water taken from the effluent released by the waste water treatment plant in HTP. Chemicals All chemicals and reagents used in this study (the standard solutions were 5000\u03bcgL\u22121 in concentration) were obtained from Supelco (Supelco Individual Calibration Standards).Apparatus and procedure 2.2.1 Automatic sampling system and procedure The process sampling module (PSM) (an automatic sampling device) was commercially available (OI Analytical, College Station, TX) and was composed of a signal-receiving circuit board, a six-way valve, and a Teflon tube with volume of 5mL and a caliber of 1/8\u2033 in connected with a set of time controllers for sampling time control. The pushing gas was high-purity nitrogen. When the pre-set sampling time was completed, the time controllers delivered a signal to the circuit board, hence, the six-way valve return to its original place as that in the status of rinsing, and was ready for the next task.

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in wastewater samples using gas chromatography (GC) techniques. They are part of a broader study aimed at understanding the concentration and time variations of VOCs in effluent from a wastewater treatment plant. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or comparative significance within the analysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as acetone and toluene are included in the same study of VOCs in wastewater, but their relationship is not explored in detail beyond their co-presence in the analysis.",
        "score": 2
