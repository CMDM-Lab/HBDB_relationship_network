    "context": "Except for the non-ideality of the adsorbates, the adsorption potential (A) was the molar work of adsorption. It can be expressed as (9) A = \u2212 \u0394 \u03bc ( kJ / mol ) = R T \u2009 ln P 0 P \u0394\u03bc is the quantitative measure of the chemical affinity of adsorbate for adsorbent. The negative plots of \u0394\u03bc plotted against amount adsorbed of the selected VOCs (Fig. 4 ) served as useful criteria for the strong interactions of adsorbate\u2013adsorbent. It was interesting to note that adsorption capacity of acetone was higher than that of BTEX during the monolayer phase. When below 0.5P/P 0 (monolayer phase) for the selected VOCs, there was a good linear relationship between adsorption potential and amount adsorbed (Fig. 4). The slope of the line showed that the interactions followed the same variation in the order of acetone<toluene<ethylbenzene<xylene, and there was no difference among the three xylene isomers. The constant slope depended on the difference between the melting and boiling points of VOCs and their cross-sectional molecules. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its adsorption characteristics during the monolayer phase of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The adsorption capacity of acetone is noted to be higher than that of BTEX compounds in this phase, indicating a strong interaction between acetone and the adsorbent. The relationship is quantitatively assessed through the adsorption potential and amount adsorbed, demonstrating that acetone's behavior in the monolayer phase is significant in understanding its adsorption dynamics compared to other VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and the monolayer phase, supported by quantitative data on adsorption capacity and interactions. The context provides evidence of acetone's strong adsorption characteristics, indicating its relevance in the study of VOCs.",
