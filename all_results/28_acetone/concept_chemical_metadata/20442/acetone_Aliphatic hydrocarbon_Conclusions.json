    "context": "Adsorption isotherms of selected VOCs on PCH, determined at ambient temperature by the gravimetric method, demonstrates different aspects of their adsorption mechanisms. Based on the qualitative and quantitative results from the proposed MLR analysis model, it was found that VOCs\u2019 cross-sectional area, polarizability, enthalpy of vaporization and critical volume were the most important parameters influencing adsorption capacities of VOCs on PCH. In general, if only the total adsorption capacities were considered, HOMO energy values were to be preferred. Thus, PCH had much higher adsorption affinity for aliphatic hydrocarbon compound such as acetone than that for aromatic compounds due to the HOMO energy values of VOCs. It was also shown that the VOC isotherms could be described by the BET\u2013Harkins\u2013Jura equations. The detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in environmental protection, health care and food industry has been a challenging task facing analytical workers for decades. Common methods for analyzing VOCs are gas chromatography (GC), mass spectrometry (MS), and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the category of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The study highlights that acetone exhibits a higher adsorption affinity on PCH compared to aromatic compounds, indicating its significant role in adsorption mechanisms. The analysis emphasizes the importance of various parameters, including the HOMO energy values, in influencing the adsorption capacities of VOCs like acetone, which is classified as an aliphatic hydrocarbon.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between acetone and aliphatic hydrocarbons, as the context discusses acetone's specific properties and its adsorption behavior in relation to its classification as an aliphatic hydrocarbon, supported by quantitative analysis.",
