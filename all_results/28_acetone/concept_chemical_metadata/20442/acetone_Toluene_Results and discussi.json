    "context": "The HOMO values of VOCs were \u221210.77, \u22129.44, \u22129.21, \u22129.28, \u22129.29 and \u22129.18eV for acetone, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene and p-xylene, respectively. Clearly, the degree of adsorption of these VOCs is due to HOMO energy values. 3.6.2 High relative pressure ranges In the high relative pressure ranges (P/P 0 \u22650.5), the adsorption capacity of acetone was higher than toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, p-xylene and o-xylene. Mesopores allow the adsorption to proceed in relatively higher pressures region with a multilayer fashion. By contrast, at relatively high pressures, multilayer adsorption occurs and adsorbate\u2013adsorbate interactions became more prevalent, which should be taken into account. At relatively high pressures, cooperative multilayer adsorption induced by van der Waals. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their adsorption properties based on their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy values. The study indicates that acetone exhibits a higher adsorption capacity than toluene at high relative pressures, suggesting a significant difference in their behavior in adsorption processes. This relationship highlights the comparative analysis of their physical properties in the context of adsorption mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and toluene, as the context provides quantitative data on their HOMO values and adsorption capacities, indicating a clear relationship in their adsorption behavior under specific conditions.",
        "score": 4
