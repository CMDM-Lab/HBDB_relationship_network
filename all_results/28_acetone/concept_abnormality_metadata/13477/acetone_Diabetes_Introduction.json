    "context": "The cellular and biochemical origin of many of these VOCs has not been determined and some of them might be of exogenous origin. So the field of exhaled breath analysis is still in its infancy. Exceptions are isoprene and acetone, which appear in relatively high concentrations of \u223c100 and \u223c500ppb, respectively. Acetone has the potential of supplementing information on the status of patients suffering from diabetes. The acetone concentration in the breath varies from 300 to 900ppb in healthy people to more than 1800ppb for diabetics. Nevertheless, acetone concentrations in the breath are not simply related to glucose levels in the blood and additional research is necessary to make it a viable marker compound for clinical routine. For example, exchange of acetone between blood and breath is taking place not only in the alveoli but also in the upper airways. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is highlighted as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can provide insights into the metabolic status of diabetic patients. The concentration of acetone in the breath is significantly higher in diabetics (over 1800 ppb) compared to healthy individuals (300-900 ppb). However, the relationship between breath acetone levels and blood glucose is complex, indicating that while acetone may serve as a potential biomarker for diabetes, further research is needed to establish its clinical utility.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between acetone and diabetes, supported by quantitative data on breath acetone levels in diabetic versus healthy individuals. However, the complexity of the relationship and the need for further research prevent a higher score.",
        "score": 4
