    "context": "This dilution factor cannot be ignored because the dilution factor unavoidably varies, e.g. when the test subject is breathing deeply or shallowly. In a previous study, performed with the same GC\u2013MS system and sampling method, we made clear that there is an important difference between the composition of alveolar air and mouth air (Van den Velde et al., submitted for publication). Acetone, the most abundant metabolite in alveolar air, is derived from decarboxylation of acetyl-CoA when lipolysis or lipid peroxidation occurs. Acetone levels are elevated in diabetes mellitus, which causes the sweet smell of the breath of these patients. Other ketones that were detected are 2-pentanone and 2-butanone, which have an acetone-like odor. High concentrations of 2-butanone are known to be a marker for lung cancer. Dimethyl sulfide is together with other sulfides responsible for the characteristic odor in the breath of cirrhotic patients. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant metabolite in alveolar air, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus. Elevated acetone levels are associated with the metabolic processes occurring during lipolysis or lipid peroxidation, which are common in diabetic patients. This elevation contributes to the characteristic sweet smell of their breath, linking acetone directly to diabetes mellitus as a potential biomarker for the condition.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong and direct relationship between acetone and diabetes mellitus, as elevated acetone levels are specifically noted as a consequence of metabolic changes in diabetic patients, indicating its relevance as a biomarker.",
