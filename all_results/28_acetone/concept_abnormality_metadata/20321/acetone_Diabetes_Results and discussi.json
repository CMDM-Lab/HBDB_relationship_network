    "context": "The average breath acetone concentration for five consecutive sampling of 60-min interval was 0.92ppmv and the corresponding RSD was 12.3%, indicating a significant difference from a group of healthy persons. Similar trend was also observed for the breath samples taken from the same patient several days later, where the average concentration and the RSD were 1.20ppmv and 5.3%, respectively. Although more extensive study should be needed to obtain the final conclusion for the interpretation of above data, these results suggested that the proposed method could be used to an initial screening or a health control of diabetic symptom without blood sampling.Determination of breath acetone from healthy person under the fasting condition It is well-known that breath acetone level increases during fasting condition as the same physiology as insulin dependent diabetes. Additionally, for the diagnosis of diabetes, ketone bodies in urine have been measured especially concentration of acetoacetate, and acetone is produced by the decarboxylation of acetoacetate. Therefore, the determination of breath acetone and urine acetone in fasting condition is one of the most suitable approaches for evaluating the validity of the proposed needle extraction method. First, breath and urine acetone in four healthy male individuals were monitored for three days just before the fasting test. Variations of the acetone concentration were ranging from 0.31 to 0.59ppmv for breath and from 0.79 to 1.20ppmv for urine. ",

        "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to diabetes through its measurement in breath samples as a potential biomarker for diabetic symptoms. The study indicates that breath acetone levels are significantly higher in individuals with diabetes compared to healthy controls, particularly during fasting. Acetone is produced from the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, a ketone body associated with insulin-dependent diabetes, suggesting its relevance in non-invasive diabetes screening methods.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between acetone and diabetes, as the context discusses acetone's role as a biomarker for diabetes, highlighting its increased levels in diabetic patients and its physiological connection to ketone metabolism.",
