    "context": "Since ethane values at study entry were performed when vitamin intake was uncontrolled, ethane exhaled may be influenced by both prooxidant and antioxidant vitamins. Since vitamin intake was better controlled at the last three time points, it is on these three time points that we concentrate our analysis and discussion. Fig 1 shows the association between pack-years and exhaled ethane level after placebo run-in (top, A), after vitamin E (center, B), and at the final visit (bottom, C). At all time points, there was a positive association between oxidant load and exhaled ethane. These correlations were statistically significant only after vitamin E treatment (Fig 1, center, B ). Fig 2 shows the relationship between pack-years and one measurement of lung function (FEV1/FVC). As expected, there was a significant negative association between these two variables. Exhaled ethane was negatively associated with FEV1/FVC in general (Fig 3 ), but this negative correlation achieved statistical significance only after vitamin E intake (Fig 3, center, B ). ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a biomarker of oxidative stress, with its exhaled levels positively associated with oxidant load. The study highlights that after vitamin E treatment, the correlation between oxidants and exhaled ethane became statistically significant, suggesting that oxidants may influence ethane production in the body. This relationship indicates that ethane could serve as an indicator of oxidative stress levels influenced by dietary antioxidants.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and oxidants, supported by statistical evidence showing a positive association, particularly after vitamin E treatment. This suggests a clear relationship where oxidants may affect ethane levels, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for oxidative stress.",
