    "context": "We conclude by contending that vitamin E alone does not significantly attenuate the effects of cigarette smoke on exhaled ethane. Exhaled ethane corresponds to oxidant load overall. After vitamin E is administered, those subjects demonstrating the largest falls in exhaled ethane appear to have better lung function. Exhaled ethane correlates negatively with measures of lung function after vitamin E replacement. These results suggest that vitamin E alone has a smaller effect than we previously noted when all three micronutrient antioxidants were supplemented simultaneously. 11 More studies need to be done, perhaps with a larger population, to further delineate the role, if any, of vitamin E treatment on alterations in lung function and the development of COPD in smokers. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical aortic revascularization procedures Clinical Investigation Committee approval was obtained to allow collection of exhaled breath from patients during surgery. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a biomarker of oxidative stress related to lung function in smokers. The study indicates that exhaled ethane levels correlate negatively with lung function measures, suggesting that higher ethane levels may reflect greater oxidative damage in the respiratory system. The administration of vitamin E appears to influence these levels, indicating a potential link between ethane and respiratory physiology, particularly in the context of lung health and disease progression in smokers.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and respiratory physiology, as the study provides evidence of ethane's role as a marker for oxidative stress affecting lung function. The correlation with lung function measures supports the relevance of ethane in respiratory health.",
