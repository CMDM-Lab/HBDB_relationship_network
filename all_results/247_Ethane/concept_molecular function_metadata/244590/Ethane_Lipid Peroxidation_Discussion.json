    "context": "In that large epidemiologic study of middle-aged people from central England, both vitamin E and vitamin C intake were associated with preservation of lung function. The authors noted that the protective effect of vitamin C was greater than for vitamin E. Another study by Rautalahti et al 8 showed reduced respiratory symptoms being correlated with increased intake of vitamin E and \u03b2-carotene. Measurement of exhaled alkanes has been used by us and others 16 ,18 ,22 ,23 as a noninvasive marker of lipid peroxidation. We favor ethane over pentane as a measure of lipid peroxidation because of the more rapid metabolism of pentane by animals and man. 24 ,25 ,26 In addition, mass spectroscopic analysis of human exhalate demonstrates the presence of significant amounts of isoprene, which may be mistaken for n-pentane during gas chromatographic analysis rendering pentane quantification complex. 27 We have found that ethane is affected by cigarette smoke 10 and diet, 28 although others have not found the latter. 29 A 3-h abstinence from cigarettes and an 8-h fast have yielded the most consistent results in the past in our laboratory.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is highlighted as a noninvasive marker for lipid peroxidation, which is a process that can lead to cellular damage. The authors prefer ethane over pentane for measuring lipid peroxidation due to its more rapid metabolism. This suggests a direct relationship where ethane serves as an indicator of lipid peroxidation levels, particularly in studies involving oxidative stress and respiratory health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and lipid peroxidation, as ethane is specifically used as a marker for this process in the study. The preference for ethane over pentane indicates its relevance in accurately assessing lipid peroxidation, supported by the context provided.",
