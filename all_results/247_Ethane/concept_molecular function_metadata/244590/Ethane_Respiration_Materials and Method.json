    "context": "11 Briefly, seated subjects breathed hydrocarbon-free air (Ultra Zero Air; Tucson, AZ) via a one-way valve (Hans-Rudolf; Kansas City, MO) from a five-layer reservoir bag (Calibrated Instruments; Hawthorne, NY) for a total of 10 min. During the first 8 min, subjects were asked to take vital capacity breaths to completely flush out the lungs with the inspirate. This 8-min sample was then discarded to remove all room air from the lungs. The exhalate from the last 2 min of this 10-min breathing period was collected in a second five-layer bag that was analyzed for ethane content. Ethane content of the hydrocarbon-free air was also measured to determine background ethane content. The exhalate collected in the bag was drawn through duplicate cold traps of activated charcoal at \u2212 70\u00b0C and 400 mL/min for 15 min. We had determined previously that this flow rate was able to trap ethane as efficiently as a flow rate of 200 mL/min. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as part of a study on respiratory gas exchange. Subjects breathed hydrocarbon-free air, and the exhaled air was collected to measure ethane content. This indicates that ethane is being evaluated in relation to respiration, specifically how it is exhaled after inhalation of clean air, highlighting its presence in respiratory processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane is directly measured in the exhaled breath during a respiration study, indicating its relationship to respiratory gas exchange. However, the context does not delve into the physiological implications of ethane in respiration.",
        "score": 3
