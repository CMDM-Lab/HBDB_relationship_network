Although the study demonstrates a null correlation between exhaled ethane levels and the physical presence of disease, we feel it is an important result particularly within the current climate of interest in OS and its relationship with disease. While it may well be the case that multiple-VOC breath analysis represents a useful clinical indicator, the results of the present study taken alongside the general acceptance of ethane as the best breath biomarker of OS, suggest that other processes giving rise to patterns of breath exhalates are implicated. Indeed, on the basis of the findings here, OS may well not be the dominant process that gives rise to a clinically useful breath analysis indicator. Ultimately, the clinical implications will become clearer as studies continue in the breath analysis field and we would suggest that null results are as significant as positive correlations in steering the direction of clinical trials and their interpretation. However, while the diagnostic applications of the ethane breath test as a marker for OS may be limited by noise factors outwith convenient clinical control, there remains exciting potential for longitudinal monitoring opportunities where a non-invasive measure of OS can bring significant value.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in breath analysis. However, the study indicates a null correlation between exhaled ethane levels and the presence of disease, suggesting that OS may not be the primary process influencing breath ethane patterns. This highlights the complexity of breath analysis and the need for further research to clarify the processes involved in breath exhalates and their clinical implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane is linked to the process of breath analysis for oxidative stress, but the findings indicate that its role may not be as significant as previously thought, suggesting a more complex relationship.",
