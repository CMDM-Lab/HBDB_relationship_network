    "context": "6 Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that an increased level of OS is associated with lung cancer. Zieba demonstrated increased concentrations of markers of OS (conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, Schiff bases, and lipid hydroperoxides) in tumour tissue homogenates compared to lung parenchyma, in patients with lung cancer. 7,8 Tumour tissue samples taken from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma showed striking alterations in antioxidant capacity consistent with increased levels of OS, compared with tumour-free lung parenchymal tissues from the same individuals. 9 Given that ethane is believed to be produced in vivo solely by the process of lipid peroxidation, it is metabolised slowly 10 and it is poorly soluble in body fat, 11 it makes an ideal breath biomarker for OS. 12 Previous studies have demonstrated increased ethane exhalation in human patients with respiratory disease, airway inflammation and other conditions. 13\u201315 However, the study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients has focussed on the hydrocarbons in the range C4\u2013C20 16,17 possibly due to the difficulties in trapping and measuring ethane (C2) at the parts per billion (ppb) level. Having said this, the majority of groups studying exhaled ethane employ variants of gas chromatography (GC) sometimes coupled with mass spectrometry. This is undeniably the accepted gold standard for VOC measurement in breath analysis, and a technique we have employed in some of our own studies in the past. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS), which is closely linked to lipid peroxidation. Ethane is produced in vivo as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, making it a relevant indicator of oxidative damage in lung cancer patients. The study highlights the association between increased ethane exhalation and conditions characterized by elevated lipid peroxidation, suggesting a direct relationship between the two in the context of respiratory diseases and cancer.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as ethane is directly produced from lipid peroxidation, establishing a critical relationship. The context emphasizes ethane's role as a biomarker for oxidative stress, which is fundamentally linked to lipid peroxidation processes in lung cancer.",
