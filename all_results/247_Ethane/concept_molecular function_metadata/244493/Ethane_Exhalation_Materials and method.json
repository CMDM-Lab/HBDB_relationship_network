    "context": "The collection of breath samples was standardised by following a consistent protocol. Subjects were instructed to breathe normally and to start providing the sample at the top of the normal inhalation (that is, without taking a deep breath and \u2018diluting\u2019 the sample with excessive room air) and exhaling as fully as possible into a 5l gas-impermeable sample bag (Tedlar, SKC Limited * * SKC Limited, Blandford Forum, Dorset, UK. ). Prior to providing the sample, subjects were required to remain in the collection venue for at least 30min to ensure consistent and thorough equilibration with the test room environment. The concentration of ethane in the exhaled breath of each subject was calculated as the difference between the measured concentration in their sample and the corresponding background sample. We have verified that this technique provides a comparable method of consistent sample collection as compared with prior inhalation of hydrocarbon-free air\u2014techniques that are generally accepted in the literature as achieving reproducible breath sample exhalates. 19 To further standardise the sampling protocol, patients were asked about possible interfering agents such as cigarette smoking and food and drink consumption. In all the patients accepted into the trial numbers, at least an hour had passed since the last cigarette and several hours since the last meal (typically breakfast) and at least 12h since their last alcoholic drink.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a component of exhaled breath samples collected from subjects following a standardized protocol. The concentration of ethane in exhalation is determined by comparing the sample concentration to a background sample, ensuring accurate measurement of ethane levels in breath. This highlights the relationship between ethane and the process of exhalation, as ethane is specifically measured in the breath to assess its concentration and potential significance in physiological studies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and exhalation, as the context details a methodical approach to measuring ethane levels in exhaled breath, indicating its relevance in physiological assessments. The methodology supports the importance of exhalation in quantifying ethane concentrations.",
