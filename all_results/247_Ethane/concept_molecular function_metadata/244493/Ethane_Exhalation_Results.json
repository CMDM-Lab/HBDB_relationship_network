    "context": "Ethane exhalation among the non-lung cancer patients presenting for investigation of respiratory disease was 0\u201325ppb, median 1.45ppb, and 38% of these patients were smokers (Fig. 3 ). There was no significant difference between ethane exhalation among the control subjects (Group 3), patients presenting at the respiratory clinic (Group 1) or lung cancer patients (Group 2). Similarly, there was no significant difference between ethane exhalation in lung cancer patients and age-matched subjects paired from the control group (Group 4). Interestingly, there was no significant correlation between age and ethane exhalation. Discussion In relation to the first aim of the study, the application of laser spectroscopy was found to facilitate rapid, accurate and reliable analysis of ethane in exhaled breath. Exhaled ethane concentrations are typically of the order of a few ppb (1:109) and this technique is consistently accurate to a further order of magnitude; that is \u00b1 0.1ppb. Part of the reason for performing the study was to investigate the practicalities of implementing an ethane breath test in an environment where the ambient ethane may be much increased, for example due to cleaning fluids and other chemical contaminants.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a volatile organic compound exhaled by patients undergoing investigation for respiratory diseases. The study measures ethane concentrations in exhaled breath, finding no significant differences between various patient groups, including lung cancer patients and controls. The focus is on the application of laser spectroscopy for accurate ethane measurement in breath samples, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and exhalation, as the study specifically investigates ethane levels in exhaled breath and discusses the implications for respiratory disease diagnostics. The quantitative data on ethane concentrations supports this relationship.",
