    "context": "The instrument is continually calibrated against a known ethane standard and checked for good zero performance every 60s by flushing the measurement cell hydrocarbon-free nitrogen gas (ethane<0.1ppb). Full technical details of the spectroscopy system along with a more comprehensive appraisal of the competing optical technologies can be found in Skeldon et al. 21 The end result is a sensitivity to ethane gas of 0.1ppb over a 1s sampling period, and an absolute accuracy of better than 10% when compared against certified empirical standards as shown in Fig. 2 . The performance of the instrument is in the process of being validated against gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) in order to afford a greater degree of medical acceptance; however, the measurement technique is absolute, based as it is on absolute sub-atomic optical transitions within the ethane molecules. The empirical comparison in Fig. 2 is intended to strengthen the confidence in this technique for the study presented, given that optical measurement techniques still underpin an extremely small minority of studies in the breath analysis field, with GC\u2013MS forming the gold standard. In terms of measuring the patients\u2019 ethane levels, the sample bags were attached to the input port of the system and the gas drawn through the sample cell at a flow rate of 5l/min. The laptop automation of the instrument affords an efficient measurement turnaround (around 12s per sample) and convenient storage of data for later analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to the process of measuring its concentration using a spectroscopy system. The instrument's calibration against a known ethane standard and its validation against gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) highlight the importance of accurate measurement processes in breath analysis. The focus is on the technical process of ensuring reliable ethane detection rather than on ethane's biological or chemical implications.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane is directly involved in the measurement process being described. However, the relationship is primarily technical, focusing on measurement accuracy rather than any biological or chemical interaction.",
