    "context": "While it may well be the case that multiple-VOC breath analysis represents a useful clinical indicator, the results of the present study taken alongside the general acceptance of ethane as the best breath biomarker of OS, suggest that other processes giving rise to patterns of breath exhalates are implicated. Indeed, on the basis of the findings here, OS may well not be the dominant process that gives rise to a clinically useful breath analysis indicator. Ultimately, the clinical implications will become clearer as studies continue in the breath analysis field and we would suggest that null results are as significant as positive correlations in steering the direction of clinical trials and their interpretation. However, while the diagnostic applications of the ethane breath test as a marker for OS may be limited by noise factors outwith convenient clinical control, there remains exciting potential for longitudinal monitoring opportunities where a non-invasive measure of OS can bring significant value. To this end, we are currently engaged in pilot studies in transplantation and radiotherapy and have completed the first cross-species exercise-induced OS study showing ethane to be a credible real-time biomarker. 24 Conclusion The TDLS approach proved to be effective and reliable, providing a real-time output of ethane concentration with a baseline sensitivity far in excess of what is practically required (0.1ppb).

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in breath analysis, while noise refers to extraneous factors that may interfere with the accuracy of breath analysis results. The text suggests that noise can limit the diagnostic applications of ethane as a reliable indicator of OS, indicating that while ethane shows promise, its effectiveness may be compromised by noise factors that are difficult to control in clinical settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane's role as a biomarker is acknowledged, but its relationship with noise is primarily about the limitations imposed by noise on its diagnostic utility rather than a direct interaction.",
