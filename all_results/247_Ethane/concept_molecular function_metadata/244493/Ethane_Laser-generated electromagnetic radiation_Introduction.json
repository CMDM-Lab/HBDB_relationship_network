    "context": "18 However, where ethane is concerned at ppb levels the GC-based technique requires pre-concentration of the breath exhalate and the time taken to measure a single sample is typically more than half-an-hour, even in an automated system. In contrast (and an important advantage in the present study) is that our spectroscopy technique offers baseline sensitivity of 0.1ppb and, moreover, this accuracy is achieved essentially in real-time, making for swift measurement of breath samples. The recent availability of such optical spectroscopy systems for gas concentration analysis promises to open up new opportunities for the application of the ethane breath test for assessment of OS in medicine. 19\u201323 The aims of this study were: (i) to investigate the feasibility of applying a novel laser spectrometer (Tunable Diode Laser Spectrometer (TDLS)) shown in Fig. 1 to the analysis of clinical breath samples; and (ii) to investigate the association between exhaled ethane and lung cancer. This study was approved by the NHS Tayside Regional Ethics Committee. Materials and methods Participants Patients Fifty-two patients (age 66\u00b113 years, mean\u00b1sd), newly referred to Ninewells Hospital for evaluation of respiratory disease were prospectively included in this study (Group 1). Being newly referred, patients had not received any medication prior to providing breath samples. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed using a novel laser spectrometer (Tunable Diode Laser Spectrometer, TDLS) for breath sample analysis, particularly in relation to assessing oxidative stress and its potential association with lung cancer. The laser-generated electromagnetic radiation from the TDLS allows for real-time, sensitive measurement of ethane levels in breath samples, highlighting the technological advancement in detecting this biomarker in clinical settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and laser-generated electromagnetic radiation, as the TDLS technology is specifically designed to measure ethane levels in breath samples, demonstrating a clear application of the laser technology in a medical context.",
