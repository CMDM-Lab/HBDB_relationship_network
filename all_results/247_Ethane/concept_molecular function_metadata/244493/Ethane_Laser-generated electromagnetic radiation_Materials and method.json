    "context": "21 The spectroscopic technique uses a lead-salt tunable diode laser operating at 3.4\u03bcm where there is a densely populated set of ethane absorption transitions. Moreover, we choose a specific absorption line within this range that is free from potential interfering species such as water and carbon dioxide. The measurement technique involves passing the laser light through a sample cell that imposes multiple reflections on the beam to create a 170m optical path length. Breath samples are drawn through this cell by an oil-free scroll pump and the absorption of the laser light at the ethane transition is measured by a photodetector and analysed using a laptop-controlled modulation scheme. The instrument is continually calibrated against a known ethane standard and checked for good zero performance every 60s by flushing the measurement cell hydrocarbon-free nitrogen gas (ethane<0.1ppb). Full technical details of the spectroscopy system along with a more comprehensive appraisal of the competing optical technologies can be found in Skeldon et al. 21 The end result is a sensitivity to ethane gas of 0.1ppb over a 1s sampling period, and an absolute accuracy of better than 10% when compared against certified empirical standards as shown in Fig. 2 .

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed using a spectroscopic technique that employs laser-generated electromagnetic radiation at a specific wavelength (3.4\u03bcm) where ethane absorption transitions occur. The laser light passes through a sample cell to measure ethane concentrations in breath samples, demonstrating a direct application of laser technology in detecting ethane gas with high sensitivity and accuracy.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and laser-generated electromagnetic radiation, as the latter is essential for the spectroscopic technique used to measure ethane concentrations. The context provides detailed information on how the laser is utilized for this purpose, indicating a clear relationship.",
