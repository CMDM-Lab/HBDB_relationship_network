    "context": "6 Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that an increased level of OS is associated with lung cancer. Zieba demonstrated increased concentrations of markers of OS (conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, Schiff bases, and lipid hydroperoxides) in tumour tissue homogenates compared to lung parenchyma, in patients with lung cancer. 7,8 Tumour tissue samples taken from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma showed striking alterations in antioxidant capacity consistent with increased levels of OS, compared with tumour-free lung parenchymal tissues from the same individuals. 9 Given that ethane is believed to be produced in vivo solely by the process of lipid peroxidation, it is metabolised slowly 10 and it is poorly soluble in body fat, 11 it makes an ideal breath biomarker for OS. 12 Previous studies have demonstrated increased ethane exhalation in human patients with respiratory disease, airway inflammation and other conditions. 13\u201315 However, the study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients has focussed on the hydrocarbons in the range C4\u2013C20 16,17 possibly due to the difficulties in trapping and measuring ethane (C2) at the parts per billion (ppb) level. Having said this, the majority of groups studying exhaled ethane employ variants of gas chromatography (GC) sometimes coupled with mass spectrometry. This is undeniably the accepted gold standard for VOC measurement in breath analysis, and a technique we have employed in some of our own studies in the past. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is linked to inflammation through its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) resulting from lipid peroxidation. Increased ethane exhalation has been observed in patients with respiratory diseases and airway inflammation, suggesting that elevated levels of ethane in breath may indicate underlying inflammatory processes associated with conditions like lung cancer. The study highlights ethane's potential as a noninvasive indicator of inflammation and oxidative damage in lung tissue.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and inflammation, supported by evidence that increased ethane levels correlate with oxidative stress and respiratory conditions. This relationship is particularly relevant in the context of lung cancer, where inflammation plays a critical role.",
