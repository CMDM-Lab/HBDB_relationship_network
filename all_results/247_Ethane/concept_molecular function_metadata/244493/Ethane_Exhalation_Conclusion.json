    "context": "To this end, we are currently engaged in pilot studies in transplantation and radiotherapy and have completed the first cross-species exercise-induced OS study showing ethane to be a credible real-time biomarker. 24 Conclusion The TDLS approach proved to be effective and reliable, providing a real-time output of ethane concentration with a baseline sensitivity far in excess of what is practically required (0.1ppb). However, the results of the study do not support the application of the ethane breath test for detection of lung cancer, as levels of exhaled ethane in lung cancer patients were not significantly different from either age-matched healthy controls, or patients presenting for evaluation of respiratory diseases other than lung cancer. OS is a ubiquitous biochemical process that accompanies most pathological processes. The assessment of such a non-specific cellular event is unlikely to be useful in the diagnosis of any pathological condition. On the other hand, the assessment and monitoring of OS might be expected to be a sensitive method for longitudinal monitoring of individual patients, to assess their response to therapy and disease progression.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a potential real-time biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) that can be measured through exhalation. The study highlights the ability to detect ethane levels in breath samples, although it concludes that exhaled ethane is not significantly different in lung cancer patients compared to controls. This suggests that while ethane can be exhaled and measured, its utility as a diagnostic marker for lung cancer is limited.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and exhalation, as ethane is measured in breath samples to assess oxidative stress. However, the lack of differentiation in lung cancer patients limits its diagnostic relevance, preventing a higher score.",
