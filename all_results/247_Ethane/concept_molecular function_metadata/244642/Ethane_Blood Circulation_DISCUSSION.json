    "context": "11 Similarly, there is a natural, low level of ethane in the atmosphere. The presence of such background levels of ethane has been found in all studies performed with breath collected from animals or human subjects. These contributions to the levels of ethane quantified in exhaled breath can be subtracted by the collection of breath after intubation but before surgery (Fig. 1). We have shown that ethane injected in the portal system is quantitatively retrieved in the breath in pigs thus equilibrated with ambient ethane, indicating that detection of an increased level of ethane in expired air is an appropriate measure of its appearance in the blood stream (unpublished data, 1990). The time-correlated feature of breath ethane determination is critical, because in this way each patient acts as his or her own control, as summarized in Fig. 2. Two conflicting studies have appeared in the literature. The first  11 has found that inspiration of 100% oxygen significantly attenuates the production of ethane, whereas the other  12 has found the exact converse. In the studies reported herein the contribution of inspired oxygen to exhaled ethane is negated by the collection of samples of exhaled breath at multiple time points during the surgery. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath as a marker for its appearance in the bloodstream. The study indicates that ethane injected into the portal system can be quantitatively retrieved in breath samples, suggesting a direct relationship between ethane levels in the blood and its detection in exhaled air. This connection highlights the potential of ethane as a biomarker for assessing blood circulation and metabolic processes in clinical settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and blood circulation, as the study provides evidence that ethane levels in breath correlate with its presence in the bloodstream, indicating its potential as a biomarker for blood circulation assessment.",
