    "context": "Some of these additional peaks follow the same time/procedure profile observed for ethane, but their significance is unknown. Efforts to identify these unknown compounds are currently in progress. This technique now renders it possible to more definitively test correlation of timing and severity of free radical damage with outcome. 14 In the future it will be possible to study the effects of inhibitors of this damage, such as superoxide dismutase, with measurement of exhaled ethane as a control for the degree of block achieved. Two important preliminary conclusions emerge from our studies to date in a limited number of patients. The theoretic possibility that free radical damage occurs at reperfusion of ischemic viscera in the clinical setting of aortic repair has been confirmed by our observations. Second, these results indicate that the lipid peroxidation previously demonstrated to occur at human liver allograft reperfusion is a generalized process that is not related solely to the tissue injury that occurs after an interval of cold preservation.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is mentioned in relation to free radical damage and lipid peroxidation during the reperfusion of ischemic tissues, particularly in the setting of aortic repair. However, there is no direct mention of obstruction or its specific relationship to ethane. The discussion focuses on ethane as a potential marker for oxidative stress rather than its connection to obstruction, making the relationship unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as ethane is associated with free radical damage in a clinical context, but there is no detailed discussion linking it specifically to obstruction. Their relationship is not clearly defined in the context provided.",
