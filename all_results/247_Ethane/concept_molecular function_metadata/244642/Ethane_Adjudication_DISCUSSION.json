    "context": "The presence of such background levels of ethane has been found in all studies performed with breath collected from animals or human subjects. These contributions to the levels of ethane quantified in exhaled breath can be subtracted by the collection of breath after intubation but before surgery (Fig. 1). We have shown that ethane injected in the portal system is quantitatively retrieved in the breath in pigs thus equilibrated with ambient ethane, indicating that detection of an increased level of ethane in expired air is an appropriate measure of its appearance in the blood stream (unpublished data, 1990). The time-correlated feature of breath ethane determination is critical, because in this way each patient acts as his or her own control, as summarized in Fig. 2. Two conflicting studies have appeared in the literature. The first  11 has found that inspiration of 100% oxygen significantly attenuates the production of ethane, whereas the other  12 has found the exact converse. In the studies reported herein the contribution of inspired oxygen to exhaled ethane is negated by the collection of samples of exhaled breath at multiple time points during the surgery. Although no control patients per se were studied, the observation that no change in the level of ethane was detected as a function of the surgical procedure in case no. 3 suggests that the contributions from ischemia and reperfusion injury to lipid peroxidation is not significant with the short cross-clamping time of 18 minutes.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its measurement in exhaled breath as a potential biomarker for assessing physiological changes during surgical procedures. However, the term 'adjudication' appears unrelated to ethane's biochemical role or its measurement, as it typically refers to a legal or decision-making process. Thus, there is no direct relationship between ethane and adjudication in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful connection between ethane and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any discussion of their relationship or relevance to each other.",
