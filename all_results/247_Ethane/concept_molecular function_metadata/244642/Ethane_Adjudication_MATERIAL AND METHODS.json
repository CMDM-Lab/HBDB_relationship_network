    "context": "Lasix (0.25 mg/kg) was administered only if urine output did not return within 15 minutes after reperfusion. Samples of exhaled breath were obtained from the exhaust circuit of the anesthesia machine before cross-clamping, during cross-clamping, and at several time intervals after the cross-clamp was removed and the viscera were reperfused. Breath was collected in 22.4 L inert gas sampling bags (five-layer bonded polymeric sampling bags; Calibrated Instruments, Inc., Ardsley, N.Y.) for periods of 2 minutes. Ethane determinations Aliquots (60 ml) of the collected breath were concentrated and the levels of ethane determined with the procedure described previously. 4,5 The method was calibrated daily with a standard mixture of a homologous series of normal alkanes (C1 \u2013 C6), and calibration curves for peak area and height versus concentration were obtained for each of the hydrocarbons. Limits of detection were found to be approximately 0.1 part per billion for ethane. Standard clinical tests Blood was drawn before surgery, after surgery, and daily until the patient was discharged.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is mentioned as a compound analyzed in exhaled breath samples collected during a surgical procedure, while adjudication is not directly referenced in relation to ethane. The focus is on the measurement of ethane levels as a potential biomarker, but there is no discussion of adjudication or its relevance to the study. Thus, the two terms appear unrelated within the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between ethane and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct connection or discussion of their interaction.",
