    "context": "We have shown that ethane injected in the portal system is quantitatively retrieved in the breath in pigs thus equilibrated with ambient ethane, indicating that detection of an increased level of ethane in expired air is an appropriate measure of its appearance in the blood stream (unpublished data, 1990). The time-correlated feature of breath ethane determination is critical, because in this way each patient acts as his or her own control, as summarized in Fig. 2. Two conflicting studies have appeared in the literature. The first  11 has found that inspiration of 100% oxygen significantly attenuates the production of ethane, whereas the other  12 has found the exact converse. In the studies reported herein the contribution of inspired oxygen to exhaled ethane is negated by the collection of samples of exhaled breath at multiple time points during the surgery. Although no control patients per se were studied, the observation that no change in the level of ethane was detected as a function of the surgical procedure in case no. 3 suggests that the contributions from ischemia and reperfusion injury to lipid peroxidation is not significant with the short cross-clamping time of 18 minutes. In the other patients the time of cross-clamping was much longer, and lipid peroxidation was detected. The earlier appearance of ethane in case 7 may be explained by the fact that in this case only the bypass pump was not used. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its detection in exhaled breath as a measure of its presence in the bloodstream. The studies mentioned explore the effects of inspired oxygen on ethane production, indicating a potential relationship between ethane levels and respiratory function. However, the specific impact of inspiration function on ethane levels is not clearly established, as conflicting studies report varying effects of oxygen on ethane production.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane is linked to inspiration function through its measurement in exhaled breath and the influence of inspired oxygen. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and the conflicting findings limit the strength of the connection.",
