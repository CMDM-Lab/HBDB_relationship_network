    "context": "To this end, we are currently engaged in pilot studies in transplantation and radiotherapy and have completed the first cross-species exercise-induced OS study showing ethane to be a credible real-time biomarker. 24 Conclusion The TDLS approach proved to be effective and reliable, providing a real-time output of ethane concentration with a baseline sensitivity far in excess of what is practically required (0.1ppb). However, the results of the study do not support the application of the ethane breath test for detection of lung cancer, as levels of exhaled ethane in lung cancer patients were not significantly different from either age-matched healthy controls, or patients presenting for evaluation of respiratory diseases other than lung cancer. OS is a ubiquitous biochemical process that accompanies most pathological processes. The assessment of such a non-specific cellular event is unlikely to be useful in the diagnosis of any pathological condition. On the other hand, the assessment and monitoring of OS might be expected to be a sensitive method for longitudinal monitoring of individual patients, to assess their response to therapy and disease progression.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in patients, including those with respiratory disorders. However, the study indicates that ethane levels in lung cancer patients did not significantly differ from those in healthy controls or patients with other respiratory diseases. This suggests that while ethane may be related to OS, its utility in diagnosing specific respiratory disorders is limited.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane is mentioned in relation to respiratory disorders through its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress. However, the lack of significant differences in ethane levels among different patient groups indicates that its diagnostic value for specific respiratory conditions is not well established.",
