    "context": "6 Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that an increased level of OS is associated with lung cancer. Zieba demonstrated increased concentrations of markers of OS (conjugated dienes, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, Schiff bases, and lipid hydroperoxides) in tumour tissue homogenates compared to lung parenchyma, in patients with lung cancer. 7,8 Tumour tissue samples taken from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma showed striking alterations in antioxidant capacity consistent with increased levels of OS, compared with tumour-free lung parenchymal tissues from the same individuals. 9 Given that ethane is believed to be produced in vivo solely by the process of lipid peroxidation, it is metabolised slowly 10 and it is poorly soluble in body fat, 11 it makes an ideal breath biomarker for OS. 12 Previous studies have demonstrated increased ethane exhalation in human patients with respiratory disease, airway inflammation and other conditions. 13\u201315 However, the study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients has focussed on the hydrocarbons in the range C4\u2013C20 16,17 possibly due to the difficulties in trapping and measuring ethane (C2) at the parts per billion (ppb) level. Having said this, the majority of groups studying exhaled ethane employ variants of gas chromatography (GC) sometimes coupled with mass spectrometry. This is undeniably the accepted gold standard for VOC measurement in breath analysis, and a technique we have employed in some of our own studies in the past. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is highlighted as a potential breath biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) associated with respiratory disorders, particularly lung cancer. Increased ethane exhalation has been observed in patients with respiratory diseases and airway inflammation, suggesting a direct link between elevated ethane levels and respiratory disorders. The study emphasizes the significance of ethane as a volatile organic compound (VOC) in breath analysis for diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and respiratory disorders, supported by evidence of increased ethane levels in patients with respiratory diseases. This relationship is backed by the context's focus on ethane as a biomarker for oxidative stress in lung conditions.",
        "score": 4
