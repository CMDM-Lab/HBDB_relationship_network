    "context": "The time-correlated feature of breath ethane determination is critical, because in this way each patient acts as his or her own control, as summarized in Fig. 2. Two conflicting studies have appeared in the literature. The first  11 has found that inspiration of 100% oxygen significantly attenuates the production of ethane, whereas the other  12 has found the exact converse. In the studies reported herein the contribution of inspired oxygen to exhaled ethane is negated by the collection of samples of exhaled breath at multiple time points during the surgery. Although no control patients per se were studied, the observation that no change in the level of ethane was detected as a function of the surgical procedure in case no. 3 suggests that the contributions from ischemia and reperfusion injury to lipid peroxidation is not significant with the short cross-clamping time of 18 minutes. In the other patients the time of cross-clamping was much longer, and lipid peroxidation was detected. The earlier appearance of ethane in case 7 may be explained by the fact that in this case only the bypass pump was not used. The lipid peroxidation documented by the elaboration of ethane is one measure of lipid damage caused by reperfusion. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is linked to ischemia through its role as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation resulting from ischemia and reperfusion injury during surgical procedures. The study indicates that ethane levels can reflect lipid damage associated with prolonged ischemic conditions, suggesting that monitoring ethane may provide insights into the extent of ischemic injury during surgery.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and ischemia, as ethane serves as a marker for lipid peroxidation related to ischemic events. The context provides evidence of this relationship through observations of ethane levels in relation to surgical procedures and ischemic conditions.",
