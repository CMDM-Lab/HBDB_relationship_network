    "context": "24 ,25 ,26 In addition, mass spectroscopic analysis of human exhalate demonstrates the presence of significant amounts of isoprene, which may be mistaken for n-pentane during gas chromatographic analysis rendering pentane quantification complex. 27 We have found that ethane is affected by cigarette smoke 10 and diet, 28 although others have not found the latter. 29 A 3-h abstinence from cigarettes and an 8-h fast have yielded the most consistent results in the past in our laboratory. 10 Since patients with obstructive lung disease may trap gas, ambient air, which contains significant amounts of ethane, may contaminate the collected sample and the more severe the obstruction, the greater the risk that ambient trapped air will contaminate the sample after the washout period. To circumvent this, we have used a particularly long washout period with hydrocarbon-free air and have employed vital capacity breaths at multiple times during the 8-min washout. We have found that hydrocarbon-free air is required since ambient air contains significant amounts of ethane, and the ambient air ethane content may change very quickly from moment to moment, particularly if the air intake vent is near a parking lot or other such source of pollution. The values for exhaled ethane we report in this article are higher than what has been reported in the literature for healthy nonsmoking subjects. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath and the potential contamination of samples from patients with obstructive lung diseases. The study highlights that patients may trap ambient air containing ethane, which complicates the quantification of exhaled ethane. The severity of lung obstruction increases the risk of sample contamination, indicating a connection between ethane levels and the challenges in assessing lung function in obstructive lung diseases.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane is linked to obstructive lung diseases through the discussion of sample contamination and its implications for accurate measurement of lung function. However, the relationship is more about methodological challenges than direct biological interactions.",
