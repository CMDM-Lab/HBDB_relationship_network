    "context": "29 A 3-h abstinence from cigarettes and an 8-h fast have yielded the most consistent results in the past in our laboratory. 10 Since patients with obstructive lung disease may trap gas, ambient air, which contains significant amounts of ethane, may contaminate the collected sample and the more severe the obstruction, the greater the risk that ambient trapped air will contaminate the sample after the washout period. To circumvent this, we have used a particularly long washout period with hydrocarbon-free air and have employed vital capacity breaths at multiple times during the 8-min washout. We have found that hydrocarbon-free air is required since ambient air contains significant amounts of ethane, and the ambient air ethane content may change very quickly from moment to moment, particularly if the air intake vent is near a parking lot or other such source of pollution. The values for exhaled ethane we report in this article are higher than what has been reported in the literature for healthy nonsmoking subjects. A review by Kneepkens et al 18 indicates that the range for ethane exhalation in nonsmoking adults is between 1.4 to 3.4 pm/kg/min. These values are lower than our results in smokers but in keeping with our previous reports 10 ,11 about ethane exhalation in never smokers. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a specific hydrocarbon present in ambient air, which can contaminate breath samples collected from patients with obstructive lung disease. The study emphasizes the need for hydrocarbon-free air during sample collection to avoid interference from ambient ethane levels, highlighting its significance as a component of hydrocarbons in environmental air quality assessments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between ethane and hydrocarbons, as ethane is explicitly mentioned as a type of hydrocarbon that poses a risk of contamination in breath analysis. The context provides evidence of ethane's relevance in the study of lung disease and air quality.",
