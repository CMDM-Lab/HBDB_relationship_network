    "context": "Since most of the patients with acute paraquat intoxication faced the emergency situation of an imminent extinction of life, and hence ethical considerations allowed only emergency therapy to be performed on them during the first 24 h, their exhaled breath samples were collected only when their vital signs had stabilized and they were able to cooperate voluntarily. The patients were placed in a supine position and asked to inhale and exhale through a disposable mouthpiece and respiratory membrane filter. After a short practice, end-tidal exhaled breath was collected from the expiratory arm of this valve, through a two-way nonrebreathing valve, to a 1-L bag (Tedlar; SKC; Eighty Four, PA). Measurement of exEth The samples of end-tidal air from the patients and 10 healthy control subjects (nonsmoking men aged 25 to 30 years) were purged with ethane-free nitrogen. The stability of ethane in Tedlar bags was confirmed by the absence of a measurable change in the concentration of the gas in them over a 2-week period. The exEth was analyzed using a homemade cryogenic concentration gas chromatography (GC)-flame ionization detector analysis system, which was built by staff at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Daejeon, Korea. A six-port gas-switching valve (SV) was modified for use with this system. ",

        "summary": "In this context, ethane and nitrogen are related through the process of purging exhaled breath samples with ethane-free nitrogen to ensure accurate measurement of ethane concentrations. The use of nitrogen serves as a carrier gas to eliminate ethane interference during analysis, highlighting its role in the experimental setup rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction between the two gases.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as ethane and nitrogen are connected through their roles in the breath analysis process, with nitrogen being used to purge ethane from samples. However, their relationship is primarily procedural rather than indicating a significant chemical or biological interaction.",
