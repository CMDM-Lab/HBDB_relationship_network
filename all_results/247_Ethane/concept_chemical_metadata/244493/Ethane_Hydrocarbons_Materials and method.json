    "context": "Moreover, we choose a specific absorption line within this range that is free from potential interfering species such as water and carbon dioxide. The measurement technique involves passing the laser light through a sample cell that imposes multiple reflections on the beam to create a 170m optical path length. Breath samples are drawn through this cell by an oil-free scroll pump and the absorption of the laser light at the ethane transition is measured by a photodetector and analysed using a laptop-controlled modulation scheme. The instrument is continually calibrated against a known ethane standard and checked for good zero performance every 60s by flushing the measurement cell hydrocarbon-free nitrogen gas (ethane<0.1ppb). Full technical details of the spectroscopy system along with a more comprehensive appraisal of the competing optical technologies can be found in Skeldon et al. 21 The end result is a sensitivity to ethane gas of 0.1ppb over a 1s sampling period, and an absolute accuracy of better than 10% when compared against certified empirical standards as shown in Fig. 2 . The performance of the instrument is in the process of being validated against gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) in order to afford a greater degree of medical acceptance; however, the measurement technique is absolute, based as it is on absolute sub-atomic optical transitions within the ethane molecules.
