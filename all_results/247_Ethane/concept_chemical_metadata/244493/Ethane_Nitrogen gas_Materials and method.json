    "context": "Moreover, we choose a specific absorption line within this range that is free from potential interfering species such as water and carbon dioxide. The measurement technique involves passing the laser light through a sample cell that imposes multiple reflections on the beam to create a 170m optical path length. Breath samples are drawn through this cell by an oil-free scroll pump and the absorption of the laser light at the ethane transition is measured by a photodetector and analysed using a laptop-controlled modulation scheme. The instrument is continually calibrated against a known ethane standard and checked for good zero performance every 60s by flushing the measurement cell hydrocarbon-free nitrogen gas (ethane<0.1ppb). Full technical details of the spectroscopy system along with a more comprehensive appraisal of the competing optical technologies can be found in Skeldon et al. 21 The end result is a sensitivity to ethane gas of 0.1ppb over a 1s sampling period, and an absolute accuracy of better than 10% when compared against certified empirical standards as shown in Fig. 2 . The performance of the instrument is in the process of being validated against gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) in order to afford a greater degree of medical acceptance; however, the measurement technique is absolute, based as it is on absolute sub-atomic optical transitions within the ethane molecules.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane and nitrogen gas are mentioned in relation to a measurement technique for detecting ethane concentrations in breath samples. Nitrogen gas is used to flush the measurement cell to ensure it is free from hydrocarbons, thereby preventing interference during the ethane measurement process. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship between ethane and nitrogen gas beyond this calibration role.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as ethane and nitrogen gas are connected through the measurement process, but their relationship is not detailed or significant beyond the calibration context.",
