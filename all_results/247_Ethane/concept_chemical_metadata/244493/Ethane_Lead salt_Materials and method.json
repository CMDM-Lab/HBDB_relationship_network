    "context": "However, measurement was typically done within 1\u20133 days after collection in order to avoid errors due to any diffusion through the wall of the bag. Measurements made of empirically mixed ethane in nitrogen concentrations using the TDLS show the storage integrity of the sampling bags to be satisfactory over the course of a week (\u223c10% alteration in concentration). Laser spectroscopy measurement technique Breath ethane was measured using an ultra-sensitive laser absorption spectroscopy technique developed at the University of Glasgow, motivated primarily for analysis of ethane in an industrial application 20 and more recently redesigned for use in healthcare applications. 21 The spectroscopic technique uses a lead-salt tunable diode laser operating at 3.4\u03bcm where there is a densely populated set of ethane absorption transitions. Moreover, we choose a specific absorption line within this range that is free from potential interfering species such as water and carbon dioxide. The measurement technique involves passing the laser light through a sample cell that imposes multiple reflections on the beam to create a 170m optical path length. Breath samples are drawn through this cell by an oil-free scroll pump and the absorption of the laser light at the ethane transition is measured by a photodetector and analysed using a laptop-controlled modulation scheme.

        "summary": "In this context, ethane is measured using a laser absorption spectroscopy technique that employs a lead-salt tunable diode laser. The lead salt is crucial for the laser's operation at the specific wavelength where ethane absorption transitions occur. Thus, while ethane and lead salt are not directly related in function, the lead salt is essential for the measurement of ethane concentrations in breath samples, indicating a technical relationship rather than a biological or chemical one.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as lead salt is used in the spectroscopic technique to measure ethane, establishing a connection through the measurement method rather than a direct chemical or biological interaction.",
