    "context": "It is important that exposure to chemicals which are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and sensitisers be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable as stated in legislation (Health & Safety Executive (HSE), 2013a). Biological monitoring (the measurement of a chemical or its breakdown products in a biological sample) is one approach for assessing occupational exposure to a chemical in the workplace. Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which includes chromates, dichromates and chromic acid is one such chemical that is classified as both a sensitising agent and a carcinogen (Agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR), 2012; International agency for research on cancer (IARC), 2016)). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds in the workplace can be through inhalation directly into the lungs from breathing in dust, fumes or mists; dermal absorption through the skin by contact with chromium solutions or solids; or by ingestion as a result of hand to mouth contamination from handling food, smoking or biting nails when hands are contaminated with chromium dust or solutions. Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds can cause respiratory irritations such as nosebleeds, ulcers and holes in the nasal septum, inflammatory respiratory problems, skin irritation and rashes from allergic dermatitis, upset stomachs, kidney and liver damage along with lung and nasal cancer (ATSDR, 2012; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). The types of industry and commercial processes where occupational exposure to Cr(VI) compounds might occur are chromate production, production of chromate pigments and dyes, electroplating and anodising, the production of stainless steel and other chromium alloys, the cutting, finishing and welding of chromium alloys and stainless steel, leather tanning and the production and spraying of paints used in the aeronautic and maritime industries (Genovese et al., 2015; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds leads to accumulation in various tissues such as the lungs, liver and kidneys (Genovese et al., 2015), with glutathione and ascorbate being responsible for reduction of Cr(VI) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) within cells with the aid of cysteine (De Flora et al., 1989; Paustenbach et al., 2003).

        "summary": "In this context, chromium, specifically hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), is linked to respiration through its classification as a carcinogen and sensitizing agent that can cause respiratory issues upon inhalation. Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds can lead to serious respiratory irritations, including nosebleeds and inflammatory respiratory problems, highlighting the significant health risks associated with chromium exposure in occupational settings.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chromium and respiration, as the context discusses the respiratory health impacts of Cr(VI) exposure, supported by evidence of specific respiratory irritations and diseases caused by inhalation of chromium compounds.",
        "score": 4
