    "context": "It is important that exposure to chemicals which are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and sensitisers be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable as stated in legislation (Health & Safety Executive (HSE), 2013a). Biological monitoring (the measurement of a chemical or its breakdown products in a biological sample) is one approach for assessing occupational exposure to a chemical in the workplace. Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which includes chromates, dichromates and chromic acid is one such chemical that is classified as both a sensitising agent and a carcinogen (Agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR), 2012; International agency for research on cancer (IARC), 2016)). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds in the workplace can be through inhalation directly into the lungs from breathing in dust, fumes or mists; dermal absorption through the skin by contact with chromium solutions or solids; or by ingestion as a result of hand to mouth contamination from handling food, smoking or biting nails when hands are contaminated with chromium dust or solutions. Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds can cause respiratory irritations such as nosebleeds, ulcers and holes in the nasal septum, inflammatory respiratory problems, skin irritation and rashes from allergic dermatitis, upset stomachs, kidney and liver damage along with lung and nasal cancer (ATSDR, 2012; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). The types of industry and commercial processes where occupational exposure to Cr(VI) compounds might occur are chromate production, production of chromate pigments and dyes, electroplating and anodising, the production of stainless steel and other chromium alloys, the cutting, finishing and welding of chromium alloys and stainless steel, leather tanning and the production and spraying of paints used in the aeronautic and maritime industries (Genovese et al., 2015; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds leads to accumulation in various tissues such as the lungs, liver and kidneys (Genovese et al., 2015), with glutathione and ascorbate being responsible for reduction of Cr(VI) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) within cells with the aid of cysteine (De Flora et al., 1989; Paustenbach et al., 2003).

        "summary": "In this context, chromium, specifically hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), is discussed as a hazardous chemical that can be ingested through hand-to-mouth contamination after handling chromium dust or solutions. The text highlights the various exposure routes to Cr(VI), including ingestion, and outlines the health risks associated with such exposure, including respiratory and systemic effects. This establishes a direct relationship between chromium and ingestion, emphasizing the importance of reducing exposure to this carcinogenic substance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chromium and ingestion, as the context explicitly discusses ingestion as a route of exposure to Cr(VI) and outlines the associated health risks. The relationship is supported by evidence of chromium's harmful effects when ingested.",
        "score": 4
