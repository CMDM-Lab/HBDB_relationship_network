    "context": "Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which includes chromates, dichromates and chromic acid is one such chemical that is classified as both a sensitising agent and a carcinogen (Agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR), 2012; International agency for research on cancer (IARC), 2016)). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds in the workplace can be through inhalation directly into the lungs from breathing in dust, fumes or mists; dermal absorption through the skin by contact with chromium solutions or solids; or by ingestion as a result of hand to mouth contamination from handling food, smoking or biting nails when hands are contaminated with chromium dust or solutions. Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds can cause respiratory irritations such as nosebleeds, ulcers and holes in the nasal septum, inflammatory respiratory problems, skin irritation and rashes from allergic dermatitis, upset stomachs, kidney and liver damage along with lung and nasal cancer (ATSDR, 2012; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). The types of industry and commercial processes where occupational exposure to Cr(VI) compounds might occur are chromate production, production of chromate pigments and dyes, electroplating and anodising, the production of stainless steel and other chromium alloys, the cutting, finishing and welding of chromium alloys and stainless steel, leather tanning and the production and spraying of paints used in the aeronautic and maritime industries (Genovese et al., 2015; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds leads to accumulation in various tissues such as the lungs, liver and kidneys (Genovese et al., 2015), with glutathione and ascorbate being responsible for reduction of Cr(VI) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) within cells with the aid of cysteine (De Flora et al., 1989; Paustenbach et al., 2003). Cr(III) is an essential element as it is needed for the regulation and metabolism of glucose, sugars and fats (Genovese et al., 2015) and thus is considered non-toxic. This difference in toxicity between the two chromium species is largely related to their permeability into cells. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed primarily in relation to its hexavalent form (Cr(VI)), which is associated with various health risks and occupational exposure. The mention of 'chromate pigments' indicates that chromium compounds are used in the production of pigments and dyes. However, the relationship is more about the industrial application of chromium rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship with pigments. The context highlights the toxicological aspects of chromium rather than its role as a pigment itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as chromium is linked to pigment production in industrial processes, but the focus is more on its health risks and toxicology rather than a detailed exploration of its relationship with pigments.",
        "score": 3
