    "context": "As shown in Table 2, no conversion of chromium species was observed during analysis with the Cr(III) concentrations less than the LOQ when measuring the PTM and EBC in-house sample spiked only with 2\u03bcg/L Cr(VI) (no Cr(III) should be present). The Cr(VI) concentration was also less than the LOQ when measuring the EBC in-house sample spiked only with 2\u03bcg/L Cr(III) (no Cr(VI) present). 3.1.2 Urine samples \u2013 total chromium The determination of total chromium in urine is an established UKAS accredited method at the Health and Safety Laboratory. The LOD is 1nmol/L (0.05\u03bcg/L) (uncorrected for creatinine). Both urine CRMs, Biorad Level 1 and Clinchek level 2 are certified for total chromium in urine; all gave good results within the target range, this is shown in Table 2.Study results Of the 22 volunteers (16 males, 6 females) in the control group only 1 (male) was a smoker, the remaining 21 volunteers were non-smokers. Of the 58 volunteers (53 males, 5 females) in the occupationally exposed worker group, 33 were non-smokers (3 female, 29 male) and 25 were smokers (1 female, 24 male). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is analyzed in relation to its presence in urine samples, with established methods for determining total chromium concentrations. However, the term 'adjudication' is not explicitly defined or discussed in relation to chromium measurements or their implications. Thus, while chromium is a focus of the study, adjudication appears to be mentioned without a clear connection to the analysis or findings presented.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of direct relevance between chromium and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context but without any discussion of their relationship or significance to each other.",
