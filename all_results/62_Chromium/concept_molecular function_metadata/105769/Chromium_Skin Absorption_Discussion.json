    "context": "Consequently, no environmental monitoring such as air monitoring, surface wipes or hand wipe sampling was performed, nor was information taken regarding length of time since last potential exposure or length of time and levels of potential exposure from any of the occupationally exposed workers prior to providing a EBC or urine sample. The statistical analysis found a lack of correlation between levels of total chromium in urine with Cr(III) in EBC and levels of total chromium in urine with the sum of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in EBC, however a low moderate correlation was found between levels of total chromium in urine with Cr(VI) in EBC. This lack of correlation is in agreement with other studies where no correlation was found between total chromium in urine with Cr(VI) in EBC (Goldoni et al., 2006) or with total chromium in urine compared with total chromium in EBC (Caglieri et al., 2006; Goldoni et al., 2010). However, this may be expected considering urinary chromium levels will reflect all three routes of exposure (inhalation, dermal and ingestion); whereas EBC samples will reflect mainly inhalation exposure with some contribution from what is present in the mouth but not exposure by dermal absorption or ingestion. Interestingly, Goldoni et al. (2010) found there was a significant correlation between total chromium in post shift EBC samples and RBC samples only. This is not always the case, as better correlation of urine with EBC samples has been observed for other elements (Goldoni et al., 2004). Whilst there is a lack of statistical significance between the pre and post working week samples for both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in EBC, all the levels were higher than the controls. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its presence in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, indicating potential exposure routes including inhalation and dermal absorption. However, the study primarily focuses on the correlation between chromium levels in urine and EBC, without directly addressing skin absorption as a significant factor. The lack of correlation between urinary chromium and EBC suggests that skin absorption may not be a primary route of exposure in this study, although it is acknowledged as one of the potential exposure pathways.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between chromium and skin absorption. While chromium exposure can occur through skin absorption, the context does not provide detailed evidence or discussion on this relationship, focusing instead on urinary and EBC levels.",
