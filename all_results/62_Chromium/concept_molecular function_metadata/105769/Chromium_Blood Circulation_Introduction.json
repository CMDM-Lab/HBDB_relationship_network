    "context": "Studies have suggested the excretion of chromium in urine after exposure by inhalation as a two or three stage process (Hoet, 2005; Petersen et al., 2000), with elimination half-lives of 7h, 15\u201330\u2009days and 3\u20135 years (ATSDR, 2012; Hoet, 2005). The main route of exposure to hexavalent chromium is by inhalation (De Flora, 2000; Hoet, 2005) so a suitable biological matrix to represent exposure by inhalation to hexavalent chromium compounds might be exhaled breath condensate (EBC). After an inhalation exposure of chromium into the lungs, it is partially removed by mucociliary clearance, but some is known to remain (Hoet, 2005). The exact bioavailability of respirable chromium is not known, however animal studies have shown that 53\u201385% of respirable Cr(VI) is cleared from the lungs by absorption into the blood stream or by mucociliary clearance in comparison to only 5\u201330% of respirable Cr(III), with the rest remaining in the lungs (ATSDR, 2012). The collection and measurement of EBC is a promising technique primarily due to its non-invasiveness and the lack of interfering solutes found in other biological matrices. EBC is the collection of condensate from cooled exhaled breath during regular tidal breathing. This collected exhaled air contains mostly water vapour but also droplets of fluid from the respiratory tract (Corradi and Mutti, 2005), meaning EBC measurements will reflect markers and molecules found in the mouth, tracheobronchial system and the alveoli (Kharitonov and Barnes, 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its inhalation exposure and subsequent excretion processes, particularly focusing on how chromium, especially in its hexavalent form, is absorbed into the bloodstream after being inhaled. The relationship to blood circulation is highlighted by the fact that a significant portion of respirable chromium is cleared from the lungs into the bloodstream, indicating its potential impact on blood circulation and systemic exposure. However, the specific effects of chromium on blood circulation are not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chromium and blood circulation, as the context discusses chromium's absorption into the bloodstream after inhalation. This suggests a direct relevance to blood circulation, although the specific physiological effects are not elaborated upon.",
