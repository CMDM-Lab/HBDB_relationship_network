    "context": "Also of interest is the two fold increase of 0.31\u03bcg/L (pre working week) to 0.62\u03bcg/L (post working week) median levels of Cr(VI) in EBC for the Other Workers. Although the median values are not higher than the Cr(VI) Workers, they are higher than the median values of the Non-Cr(VI) Workers, indicating inhalation exposure is not limited solely to workers operating directly in areas of the workplace where chromium processes occur. Chromium exposure of Other Workers is more evident when the median values for both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in EBC are compared against the control group values, which were all below the LOQ, however there were only 11 volunteers in the Other Workers group. No other studies have determined chromium EBC measurements in this type of worker cohort for comparison. In recent literature, there is reference to the need for a marker in EBC samples to standardise for dilution (Kuban and Foret, 2013; Rosias, 2012), in the same way creatinine is utilised to correct for concentration of urine. It is suggested that the droplets of fluid from the respiratory tract can be diluted by the water vapour found in EBC and will vary amongst individuals (Rosias, 2012). At present, there is no consensus on a suitable and accurate biomarker to correct for dilution, as smoking status, inflammatory conditions such as asthma or the inhaled contaminant itself have affected their usefulness in biomarkers studies (Dodig and Cepelak, 2013; Hoffmeyer et al., 2015).

        "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is discussed in relation to its levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) among different worker cohorts, particularly focusing on Cr(VI) exposure. The term 'adjudication' is indirectly referenced in the context of needing a standard marker for EBC samples to account for dilution effects, which is crucial for accurately assessing chromium exposure. However, there is no direct relationship established between chromium and adjudication, as adjudication pertains more to the need for standardization in measurement rather than a specific interaction with chromium itself.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as chromium exposure is discussed in the context of needing a standard marker for EBC, but there is no detailed relationship or interaction between chromium and adjudication itself.",
