    "context": "for Cr(VI) Workers reported here in this study. The studies by Goldoni et al. (2006, 2010) in addition to the work reported here indicate the need for a comprehensive EBC collection protocol to better understand dwell, half-life and excretion rates of chromium in EBC. Also of interest is the two fold increase of 0.31\u03bcg/L (pre working week) to 0.62\u03bcg/L (post working week) median levels of Cr(VI) in EBC for the Other Workers. Although the median values are not higher than the Cr(VI) Workers, they are higher than the median values of the Non-Cr(VI) Workers, indicating inhalation exposure is not limited solely to workers operating directly in areas of the workplace where chromium processes occur. Chromium exposure of Other Workers is more evident when the median values for both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in EBC are compared against the control group values, which were all below the LOQ, however there were only 11 volunteers in the Other Workers group. No other studies have determined chromium EBC measurements in this type of worker cohort for comparison. In recent literature, there is reference to the need for a marker in EBC samples to standardise for dilution (Kuban and Foret, 2013; Rosias, 2012), in the same way creatinine is utilised to correct for concentration of urine.

        "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is discussed in relation to its exposure levels among workers involved in chromium processing. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive protocol to assess chromium levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to understand exposure dynamics. The relationship indicates that chromium processing activities contribute to inhalation exposure, affecting both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) levels in workers, thus linking chromium to occupational health processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chromium and the processes involved in its exposure assessment among workers. The study provides evidence of chromium levels in EBC and emphasizes the need for standardized protocols, indicating a clear relationship within the occupational health context.",
        "score": 4
