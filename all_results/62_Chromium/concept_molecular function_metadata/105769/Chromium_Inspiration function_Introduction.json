    "context": "There are no publications measuring Cr(VI) by inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and there are no publications reporting the measurement of Cr(III) in EBC samples of workers or background populations. We have previously validated and published our novel analytical methodology in which the two chromium species were determined in EBC samples (Leese et al., 2016). The objective of this feasibility study was to determine if both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) could be detected and measured in \u2018real\u2019 EBC samples. Having collected samples the aim was to determine whether there was a difference between the levels of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) found in EBC samples between a control group not occupationally exposed to chromium compounds and an occupational group who are potentially occupationally exposed to Cr(VI) compounds by inhalation. In addition, any difference in chromium EBC levels would be investigated between pre and post working week samples from the occupationally exposed volunteers. Study group The occupationally exposed group (n=58) consisted of 53 males and 5 females, all were over the age of 18 years, with a mean age of 45 years. Individuals volunteered in response to an email sent to companies who had previously sent urine samples to the Health & Safety Laboratory for chromium analysis as part of a biological monitoring program.

        "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is investigated in relation to its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples from workers potentially exposed to chromium compounds through inhalation. The study aims to measure levels of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) to assess any differences between occupationally exposed individuals and a control group. While chromium exposure may impact respiratory health, the specific relationship to inspiration function is not directly addressed in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between chromium and inspiration function, as chromium exposure is linked to inhalation but lacks detailed discussion on its specific effects on respiratory function or inspiration.",
