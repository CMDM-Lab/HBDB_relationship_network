    "context": "It is clear that the pH is an important parameter in the preparation of catalysts, since it has a significant effect on their textural properties. It can be seen that very acidic conditions lead to a significant decrease of the catalyst surface area and pore volume, which allows foreseeing a worse catalytic performance on the oxidation reactions. The results of all the characterization techniques allowed to choose the catalyst obtained at pH 4 as the most suitable for VOC oxidation.Catalytic tests The catalytic performance of the Cr-NaY zeolite obtained at pH 4 was evaluated in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. The same study was carried out with the starting NaY zeolite in order to assess the effect of chromium in the catalytic activity. The light-off curves of a standard experiment consisted in two cycles of: increasing temperature, keeping the temperature constant for 1h and decreasing it. For all VOC tested, it was observed that the catalytic performance in the increasing temperature step in the first and second cycle was quite similar and the same was observed for the decreasing temperature step. This is a clear indication of the stability of the catalyst in the oxidation reaction. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is evaluated for its role in enhancing the catalytic activity of Cr-NaY zeolite during the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like ethyl acetate, ethanol, and toluene. The study assesses how chromium affects the enzyme-like activity of the catalyst, particularly under varying pH conditions. The results indicate that chromium significantly influences the catalytic performance, suggesting a direct relationship between chromium presence and enzyme activity in the context of VOC oxidation reactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chromium and enzyme activity, as the study provides evidence of chromium's role in enhancing catalytic performance. The relationship is supported by experimental data showing the effect of chromium on the oxidation reactions, indicating a clear functional interaction.",
