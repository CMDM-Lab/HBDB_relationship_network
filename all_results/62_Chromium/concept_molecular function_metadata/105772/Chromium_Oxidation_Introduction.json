    "context": "As reported in previous work, a low-cost system combining the biosorption properties of a microorganism with the ion exchange properties of a zeolite was able to remove hexavalent chromium from contaminated water. After the biosorption process, Y zeolite loaded with Cr can be used as competitive and selective catalyst to be applied in catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds. Therefore, Cr(VI) that is usually considered a xenobiotic pollutant, can be reused as a catalyst to be applied in the oxidation of persistent organic compounds, presenting a double environmental benefit. The aim of this study is the reutilization of the chromium-containing NaY zeolite obtained by biorecovery of chromium from water as catalyst in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. Biosorption assays The metal-loaded zeolite samples were obtained after biosorption experiments as reported in a previous work (not yet published). The experiments were performed with Arthrobacter viscosus supported on NaY zeolite, using different pH values (1, 2, 3 and 4). The biomass concentration and initial Cr(VI) concentration used were 5g/L and 100mg/L, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium (specifically Cr(VI)) is discussed in relation to its role as a catalyst in the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) after being biosorbed onto zeolite. The study highlights the dual environmental benefit of reusing chromium from contaminated water as a catalyst for oxidation processes, indicating a significant relationship between chromium and oxidation in environmental remediation efforts.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chromium and oxidation, as the context provides evidence of chromium's catalytic role in the oxidation of VOCs, demonstrating its practical application in environmental cleanup. The relationship is significant and supported by the study's findings.",
        "score": 4
