    "context": "As reported in previous work, a low-cost system combining the biosorption properties of a microorganism with the ion exchange properties of a zeolite was able to remove hexavalent chromium from contaminated water. After the biosorption process, Y zeolite loaded with Cr can be used as competitive and selective catalyst to be applied in catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds. Therefore, Cr(VI) that is usually considered a xenobiotic pollutant, can be reused as a catalyst to be applied in the oxidation of persistent organic compounds, presenting a double environmental benefit. The aim of this study is the reutilization of the chromium-containing NaY zeolite obtained by biorecovery of chromium from water as catalyst in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. Biosorption assays The metal-loaded zeolite samples were obtained after biosorption experiments as reported in a previous work (not yet published). The experiments were performed with Arthrobacter viscosus supported on NaY zeolite, using different pH values (1, 2, 3 and 4). The biomass concentration and initial Cr(VI) concentration used were 5g/L and 100mg/L, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is utilized as a component of a zeolite catalyst after being biosorbed from contaminated water. The study highlights the dual role of chromium, where it is first removed as a pollutant and then repurposed as a catalyst for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. This demonstrates a significant relationship between chromium and its application as a catalyst, emphasizing its environmental benefits in both remediation and catalysis.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as chromium is directly linked to its function as a catalyst in the oxidation process. The context provides clear evidence of chromium's dual role in environmental remediation and catalysis, showcasing its critical importance in the study.",
        "score": 5
