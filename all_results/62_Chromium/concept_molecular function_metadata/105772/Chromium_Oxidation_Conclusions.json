    "context": "In terms of VOC conversion, the following sequence was observed: ethanol>ethyl acetate>toluene. However, in terms of selectivity to CO2, ethyl acetate was the only compound for which total oxidation was achieved, and therefore the sequence changes to ethyl acetate>toluene>ethanol. The Cr-NaY zeolite obtained after biosorption of Cr(VI) was successfully reutilized as catalyst in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. XPS analysis proved that chromium was exchanged by the zeolite as Cr(III) and upon calcination the trivalent chromium suffered oxidation to Cr(VI), which was confirmed by Raman and H2-TPR. For all VOC tested, the presence of chromium in the zeolite shifted the reaction pathways, allowing a notable increase of activity and selectivity to CO2, in comparison with the starting zeolite NaY. In terms of VOC conversion the following sequence was observed: ethanol>ethyl acetate>toluene. However, in terms of selectivity to CO2, ethyl acetate was the only VOC for which total oxidation was attained and therefore the above sequence changes to ethyl acetate>toluene>ethanol. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is involved in the oxidation process of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when used as a catalyst in zeolite. The study highlights that chromium, initially present as Cr(III), undergoes oxidation to Cr(VI) upon calcination, enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 production during the oxidation of VOCs like ethyl acetate, ethanol, and toluene. This indicates a significant role of chromium in facilitating oxidation reactions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chromium and oxidation, as the context provides evidence of chromium's catalytic role in the oxidation of VOCs, supported by analytical techniques confirming its oxidation state changes.",
        "score": 4
