    "context": "The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) performed by the bacterium was significantly favoured by lower pH values, as it is essential to supply numerous protons to promote the rate of the reduction reaction. Nevertheless, for extremely acidic pH values, in this case pH 1 and pH 2, the structure of the zeolite is probably damaged and this can explain the lower efficiencies of total Cr removal observed for these pH values. The best removal efficiencies of total chromium were obtained for the highest pH values, 3 and 4, 69.5% and 88.6%, respectively. In order to assess the properties and the applicability of these chromium-loaded zeolites obtained by biosorption in the oxidation of VOC, the samples were characterized by several techniques.Characterization 3.2.1 Chemical and morphology analysis The zeolite samples obtained after biosorption of chromium were characterized by chemical analysis (ICP-AES) and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The results of bulk chemical analyses revealed a high content of chromium in the zeolite, 0.76% and 0.90% for the catalysts obtained at pH 3 and pH 4, respectively. These results are in agreement with the high removal efficiencies attained for these pH values. The presence of chromium in the zeolite was also detected by EDS analysis. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its reduction from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by bacteria and its subsequent biosorption onto zeolites. However, there is no mention of edema or any direct relationship between chromium and edema. The focus is primarily on chromium's chemical behavior and its removal efficiencies at different pH levels, with no implications for edema or related physiological effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any relevant relationship between chromium and edema in the context provided. They are mentioned in the same text, but there is no discussion or connection established between them.",
