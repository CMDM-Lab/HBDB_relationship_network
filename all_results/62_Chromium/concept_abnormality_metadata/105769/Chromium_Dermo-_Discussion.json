    "context": "Consequently, no environmental monitoring such as air monitoring, surface wipes or hand wipe sampling was performed, nor was information taken regarding length of time since last potential exposure or length of time and levels of potential exposure from any of the occupationally exposed workers prior to providing a EBC or urine sample. The statistical analysis found a lack of correlation between levels of total chromium in urine with Cr(III) in EBC and levels of total chromium in urine with the sum of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in EBC, however a low moderate correlation was found between levels of total chromium in urine with Cr(VI) in EBC. This lack of correlation is in agreement with other studies where no correlation was found between total chromium in urine with Cr(VI) in EBC (Goldoni et al., 2006) or with total chromium in urine compared with total chromium in EBC (Caglieri et al., 2006; Goldoni et al., 2010). However, this may be expected considering urinary chromium levels will reflect all three routes of exposure (inhalation, dermal and ingestion); whereas EBC samples will reflect mainly inhalation exposure with some contribution from what is present in the mouth but not exposure by dermal absorption or ingestion. Interestingly, Goldoni et al. (2010) found there was a significant correlation between total chromium in post shift EBC samples and RBC samples only. This is not always the case, as better correlation of urine with EBC samples has been observed for other elements (Goldoni et al., 2004). Whilst there is a lack of statistical significance between the pre and post working week samples for both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in EBC, all the levels were higher than the controls. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its levels in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, with a focus on different exposure routes including dermal absorption. The analysis indicates that urinary chromium levels reflect multiple exposure routes, including dermal, while EBC primarily reflects inhalation exposure. However, the specific relationship between chromium and dermal exposure is not quantitatively detailed, leading to a general understanding of chromium's presence in various exposure contexts without a strong emphasis on dermal absorption's impact.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between chromium and dermal exposure, as both are mentioned in the context of exposure routes. However, the relationship lacks detailed discussion or quantitative data specifically linking chromium levels to dermal exposure effects.",
