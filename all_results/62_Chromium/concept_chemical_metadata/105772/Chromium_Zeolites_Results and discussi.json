    "context": "The authors found that this phenomenon was due to the adsorption properties of the support and also to the accumulation of coke. In particular, a support which is capable of retaining the VOC at temperatures higher than the reaction temperature can lead to oscillations in the apparent conversion into CO2. In the present work, the formation of coke during the oxidation of toluene over Cr-NaY zeolite will be further evaluated. Analyzing Fig. 8(b) it is clear that the presence of chromium in the zeolite dramatically changes the catalytic performance in the oxidation of toluene. With Cr-NaY, the maximum conversion into CO2 attained was 70% at 450\u00b0C, while the production of CO2 was not observed at any temperature in the range with the starting NaY zeolite. In terms of VOC conversion (data not shown), toluene started to be converted at 140\u00b0C with Cr-NaY and at 120\u00b0C with NaY. The complete conversion of toluene was achieved at 450\u00b0C with Cr-NaY, whereas the starting zeolite only attained 23% of conversion at 500\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is incorporated into the zeolite structure (specifically Cr-NaY zeolite) to enhance its catalytic performance in the oxidation of toluene. The presence of chromium significantly improves the conversion rates of toluene to CO2, achieving a maximum conversion of 70% at 450\u00b0C, compared to the starting NaY zeolite, which shows minimal conversion. This indicates a strong functional relationship where chromium modifies the zeolite's properties to facilitate better catalytic activity for volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between chromium and zeolites, as the presence of chromium in the zeolite structure is shown to dramatically enhance its catalytic performance in VOC oxidation, supported by quantitative conversion data.",
        "score": 5
