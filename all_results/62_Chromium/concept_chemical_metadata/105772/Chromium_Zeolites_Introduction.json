    "context": "As reported in previous work, a low-cost system combining the biosorption properties of a microorganism with the ion exchange properties of a zeolite was able to remove hexavalent chromium from contaminated water. After the biosorption process, Y zeolite loaded with Cr can be used as competitive and selective catalyst to be applied in catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds. Therefore, Cr(VI) that is usually considered a xenobiotic pollutant, can be reused as a catalyst to be applied in the oxidation of persistent organic compounds, presenting a double environmental benefit. The aim of this study is the reutilization of the chromium-containing NaY zeolite obtained by biorecovery of chromium from water as catalyst in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. Biosorption assays The metal-loaded zeolite samples were obtained after biosorption experiments as reported in a previous work (not yet published). The experiments were performed with Arthrobacter viscosus supported on NaY zeolite, using different pH values (1, 2, 3 and 4). The biomass concentration and initial Cr(VI) concentration used were 5g/L and 100mg/L, respectively. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium and zeolites are closely related through their application in environmental remediation. The study highlights the use of zeolites, specifically NaY zeolite, for the biosorption of hexavalent chromium from contaminated water. After biosorption, the chromium-loaded zeolite is utilized as a catalyst for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, demonstrating a dual benefit of chromium reuse and zeolite functionality in pollution control. This relationship underscores the potential of zeolites in enhancing the environmental management of chromium pollutants.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance between chromium and zeolites, as they are directly linked through a specific application in environmental remediation, with clear evidence of their interaction and mutual benefits in the context provided.",
