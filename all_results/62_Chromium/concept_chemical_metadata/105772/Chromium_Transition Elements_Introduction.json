    "context": "Although it is generally accepted that noble metal catalysts are more active than metal oxides, their susceptibility to poisoning, high cost and limited availability have been encouraging their replacement by low cost transition metals. These catalysts present sufficient activity, although they are in general less active than noble metals at low temperatures. Nevertheless, in some cases, these catalysts show performances as high or higher than supported noble metal catalysts. Among the transition metals, chromium is an interesting metal to be applied in catalytic oxidation reactions because of its multiple oxidation states. Chromium catalysts have been extensively studied in the oxidation of many pollutants namely propene, ethyl acetate and methylene chloride. It is well known that supports strongly affect the catalytic activity, particularly in oxidation reactions. The type of support used has a significant influence on metal dispersion. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is identified as a transition metal that plays a significant role in catalytic oxidation reactions. The text discusses the advantages of using transition metals, including chromium, as catalysts due to their multiple oxidation states and the influence of supports on their catalytic activity. This highlights chromium's relevance within the broader category of transition elements, particularly in environmental applications.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chromium and transition elements, as chromium is explicitly categorized as a transition metal and its catalytic properties are discussed in detail. The context provides evidence of chromium's application in oxidation reactions, underscoring its significance among transition metals.",
