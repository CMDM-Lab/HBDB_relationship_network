    "context": "However, in terms of selectivity to CO2, ethyl acetate was the only compound for which total oxidation was achieved, and therefore the sequence changes to ethyl acetate>toluene>ethanol. The Cr-NaY zeolite obtained after biosorption of Cr(VI) was successfully reutilized as catalyst in the oxidation of ethyl acetate, ethanol and toluene. XPS analysis proved that chromium was exchanged by the zeolite as Cr(III) and upon calcination the trivalent chromium suffered oxidation to Cr(VI), which was confirmed by Raman and H2-TPR. For all VOC tested, the presence of chromium in the zeolite shifted the reaction pathways, allowing a notable increase of activity and selectivity to CO2, in comparison with the starting zeolite NaY. In terms of VOC conversion the following sequence was observed: ethanol>ethyl acetate>toluene. However, in terms of selectivity to CO2, ethyl acetate was the only VOC for which total oxidation was attained and therefore the above sequence changes to ethyl acetate>toluene>ethanol. This work presents a double environmental benefit, as it allows the treatment of chromium-contaminated wastewater and simultaneously the removal of VOC from gaseous streams. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium and zeolites are closely related through the process of biosorption and catalysis. The Cr-NaY zeolite, formed after the biosorption of Cr(VI), acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like ethyl acetate, ethanol, and toluene. The presence of chromium enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity towards CO2 production, demonstrating a significant interaction between chromium and zeolites in environmental applications, particularly in treating chromium-contaminated wastewater while removing VOCs from gaseous streams.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between chromium and zeolites, as the context provides evidence of chromium's role in enhancing the catalytic properties of zeolites for VOC oxidation. The interaction is significant and supported by experimental findings, although it does not delve into the mechanistic details.",
