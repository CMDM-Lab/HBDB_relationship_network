    "context": "Individuals volunteered in response to an email sent to companies who had previously sent urine samples to the Health & Safety Laboratory for chromium analysis as part of a biological monitoring program. The occupationally exposed workers were categorised into three types of workers and termed Cr(VI) Workers, Non-Cr(VI) Workers and Other Workers; Cr(VI) Workers \u2013 Individuals who work directly with chromium compounds (e.g. Cr(VI) platers, jiggers and blenders). Non-Cr(VI) Workers \u2013 Individuals who did not work directly with chromium compounds, but worked alongside colleagues working directly with chromium (e.g. nickel, silver or copper electroplaters, maintenance). Other Workers \u2013 Individuals who work neither with chromium nor alongside chromium workers (e.g. inspectors, administration staff, and managers). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to chromium compounds, specifically focusing on workers exposed to these compounds in various occupational settings. The categorization of workers into Cr(VI) Workers, Non-Cr(VI) Workers, and Other Workers highlights the direct involvement of certain individuals with chromium compounds, particularly those working with Cr(VI) in plating and blending processes. This indicates a clear relationship where chromium compounds are the substances that pose exposure risks to the categorized workers.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chromium and chromium compounds, as the context explicitly categorizes workers based on their direct or indirect exposure to these compounds, indicating a clear occupational health relevance.",
        "score": 4
