    "context": "Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which includes chromates, dichromates and chromic acid is one such chemical that is classified as both a sensitising agent and a carcinogen (Agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR), 2012; International agency for research on cancer (IARC), 2016)). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds in the workplace can be through inhalation directly into the lungs from breathing in dust, fumes or mists; dermal absorption through the skin by contact with chromium solutions or solids; or by ingestion as a result of hand to mouth contamination from handling food, smoking or biting nails when hands are contaminated with chromium dust or solutions. Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds can cause respiratory irritations such as nosebleeds, ulcers and holes in the nasal septum, inflammatory respiratory problems, skin irritation and rashes from allergic dermatitis, upset stomachs, kidney and liver damage along with lung and nasal cancer (ATSDR, 2012; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). The types of industry and commercial processes where occupational exposure to Cr(VI) compounds might occur are chromate production, production of chromate pigments and dyes, electroplating and anodising, the production of stainless steel and other chromium alloys, the cutting, finishing and welding of chromium alloys and stainless steel, leather tanning and the production and spraying of paints used in the aeronautic and maritime industries (Genovese et al., 2015; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds leads to accumulation in various tissues such as the lungs, liver and kidneys (Genovese et al., 2015), with glutathione and ascorbate being responsible for reduction of Cr(VI) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III)) within cells with the aid of cysteine (De Flora et al., 1989; Paustenbach et al., 2003). Cr(III) is an essential element as it is needed for the regulation and metabolism of glucose, sugars and fats (Genovese et al., 2015) and thus is considered non-toxic. This difference in toxicity between the two chromium species is largely related to their permeability into cells. ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium refers to the element that exists in various oxidation states, including hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which encompasses chromates. Chromates are specific compounds derived from chromium that are known to be toxic and carcinogenic. The text discusses the health risks associated with Cr(VI) exposure, particularly in occupational settings, and contrasts it with the non-toxic nature of trivalent chromium (Cr(III)), highlighting the significant difference in toxicity between these two forms of chromium.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between chromium and chromates, as chromates are a specific form of chromium that poses significant health risks. The context provides strong evidence of their connection through discussions of toxicity and exposure pathways.",
        "score": 5
