    "context": "This collected exhaled air contains mostly water vapour but also droplets of fluid from the respiratory tract (Corradi and Mutti, 2005), meaning EBC measurements will reflect markers and molecules found in the mouth, tracheobronchial system and the alveoli (Kharitonov and Barnes, 2001). EBC is reported to contain both volatile substances in the gaseous phase along with low volatile and non-volatile substances in the form of droplets originating from the epithelial lining fluid, as aerosol particles in EBC (Rosias, 2012). The non-volatile substances will include salts, proteins, lipids and environmental and/or occupational contaminants (Corradi and Mutti, 2005; Goldoni et al., 2013; Kharitonov and Barnes, 2001). There are only a small number of studies concerning the relationship between EBC measurements and occupational exposure, where detectable levels of metals in EBC have been reported such as; for cobalt and tungsten (Broding et al., 2009; Goldoni et al., 2004), beryllium (Hulo et al., 2016), manganese (Hulo et al., 2014), lead (Felix et al., 2015) and iron, nickel, aluminium and chromium (Caglieri et al., 2006; Goldoni et al., 2010; Goldoni et al., 2006; Gube et al., 2010; Hoffmeyer et al., 2011). To date there are only two published studies where Cr(VI) was measured in EBC samples of workers (Goldoni et al., 2010; Goldoni et al., 2006), however both used a method combining solvent extraction with complexation with diphenylcarbazide and measurement performed by atomic absorption spectrometry. There are no publications measuring Cr(VI) by inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and there are no publications reporting the measurement of Cr(III) in EBC samples of workers or background populations. We have previously validated and published our novel analytical methodology in which the two chromium species were determined in EBC samples (Leese et al., 2016). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium and tungsten are both mentioned as metals that can be detected in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as environmental or occupational contaminants. However, the discussion primarily focuses on chromium, particularly its species (Cr(VI) and Cr(III)), with no direct comparison or specific relationship established between chromium and tungsten. They are listed among other metals but lack detailed interaction or significance in the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both chromium and tungsten are mentioned as detectable metals in EBC, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating a general category of occupational contaminants without specific interactions.",
