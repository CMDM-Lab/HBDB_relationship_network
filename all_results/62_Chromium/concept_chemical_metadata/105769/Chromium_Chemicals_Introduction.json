    "context": "In Great Britain (GB), many activities/occupations can involve the use of chemicals considered hazardous to worker health. It is important that exposure to chemicals which are classified as carcinogens, mutagens and sensitisers be reduced to as low as reasonably practicable as stated in legislation (Health & Safety Executive (HSE), 2013a). Biological monitoring (the measurement of a chemical or its breakdown products in a biological sample) is one approach for assessing occupational exposure to a chemical in the workplace. Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which includes chromates, dichromates and chromic acid is one such chemical that is classified as both a sensitising agent and a carcinogen (Agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR), 2012; International agency for research on cancer (IARC), 2016)). Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds in the workplace can be through inhalation directly into the lungs from breathing in dust, fumes or mists; dermal absorption through the skin by contact with chromium solutions or solids; or by ingestion as a result of hand to mouth contamination from handling food, smoking or biting nails when hands are contaminated with chromium dust or solutions. Exposure to Cr(VI) compounds can cause respiratory irritations such as nosebleeds, ulcers and holes in the nasal septum, inflammatory respiratory problems, skin irritation and rashes from allergic dermatitis, upset stomachs, kidney and liver damage along with lung and nasal cancer (ATSDR, 2012; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012). The types of industry and commercial processes where occupational exposure to Cr(VI) compounds might occur are chromate production, production of chromate pigments and dyes, electroplating and anodising, the production of stainless steel and other chromium alloys, the cutting, finishing and welding of chromium alloys and stainless steel, leather tanning and the production and spraying of paints used in the aeronautic and maritime industries (Genovese et al., 2015; HSE, 2013b; Rakhunde et al., 2012).

        "summary": "In this context, chromium, specifically hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), is identified as a hazardous chemical that poses significant health risks, including carcinogenic and sensitizing effects. The discussion emphasizes the importance of monitoring exposure to such chemicals in occupational settings, highlighting chromium's classification as a dangerous chemical that requires careful handling and regulation to protect worker health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between chromium and chemicals, as chromium is specifically categorized as a hazardous chemical with serious health implications. The context provides detailed information on its risks and the need for monitoring, indicating a strong relevance in occupational health.",
        "score": 4
