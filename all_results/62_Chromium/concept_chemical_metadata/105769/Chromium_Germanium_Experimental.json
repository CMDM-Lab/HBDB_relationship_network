    "context": "Operating conditions were: nebuliser gas flow rate 0.81\u20130.96L/min, collision gas flow rate 3.5mL/min, dwell times were 100ms for 52Cr and 20msfor 72Ge (internal standard), with 100 sweeps per replicate and three replicates per sample.Reagents Potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) (analytical grade), chromium(III) chloride (CrCl3)(laboratory grade) and EDTA (diaminoethanetetracetic acid) were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK). SpA ammonia solution (NH3) and UpA Nitric Acid were obtained from Romil (Cambridge, UK). BDH ICP-MS single standards of 1000mg/L chromium and germanium were obtained from VWR International (Lutterworth, UK). All solutions were prepared fresh each day of analysis using ultrapure deionised water (18.2M\u03a9hmcm) from a Millipore system (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).Sample collection All urine samples were collected in 25mL urine collection bottles (Sterilin Ltd, Newport, UK). EBC samples were collected using a TURBO-DECCS (Transportable Unit for Research on Biomarkers Obtained from Disposable Exhaled Condensate Collection Systems) by ItalChill (Parma, Italy). The TURBO-DECCS technique is as previously described (Leese et al., 2016). ",

        "summary": "In this context, chromium and germanium are mentioned as elements involved in analytical procedures, specifically in the preparation of standards for analysis using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). However, there is no discussion of their chemical interactions, biological significance, or any direct relationship beyond their roles as standards in the analytical process. They are simply listed as components of the methodology without further elaboration on their relevance to each other.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as chromium and germanium are only mentioned in the context of analytical standards for ICP-MS without any functional or chemical relationship discussed.",
