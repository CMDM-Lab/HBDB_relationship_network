    "context": "The admixing of ozone did not increase symptom rating (Fiedler et al., 2005). Eye irritation in humans was indicated from an eye alone exposure study to LOP. The eye blink frequency, as a physiological measure of trigeminal stimulation, increased significantly by exposure to LOP generated from \u22650.092ppm limonene and \u22650.101ppm ozone. The ratio between the limonene and ozone concentrations was about one in each LOP mixture and the residual ozone was about 0.04ppm (N\u00f8jgaard et al., 2005). Overall, this suggests an exposure-dependent effect of acute LOP exposure, but how the acute effects should be translated into indoor air guidelines at repeated exposures are less clear. Little is known about exposure-effects of repeated exposures to ozone-initiated terpene reaction products except for isoprene and ozone. Ozone-initiated isoprene reaction mixtures contain, for example, formaldehyde, formic and acetic acid, methacrolein, methylvinyl ketone, and C2\u2013C6 linear saturated aldehydes (Wilkins et al., 2001).

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is indirectly related to ozone through the discussion of ozone-initiated reactions with terpenes, including limonene. While the study mentions the effects of ozone on eye irritation and the generation of various reaction products, it does not provide a direct relationship or specific interaction between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone. The focus is more on the broader implications of ozone's role in reactions with volatile organic compounds (VOCs).",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are involved in the context of ozone-initiated reactions with terpenes, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interaction.",
