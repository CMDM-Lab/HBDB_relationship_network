    "context": "A rapid shallow breathing response would decrease TI and increase f, but the opposite was observed. Overall, no firm conclusion could be drawn about effects at the alveolar level, which is considered to apply across species. Although mice are obligate nose breathers and humans oronasal breathers, the potentially higher deposition in the upper airways in the mice compared to humans is expected to be compensated by the higher exposure level.Airway inflammation due to VOCs and limonene/ozone reaction products The BAL fluid analyses did not indicate lung inflammation. In contrast, acute exposure in rats for 3h to a LOP mixture, that was generated from 6ppm limonene and 0.8ppm ozone, showed an up regulation of inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, cyclooxygenase-2 and an antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase)) in lung macrophages and type II lung cells, and histopathological changes (Sunil et al., 2007). However, no increase was observed in BAL protein levels and alveolar macrophage counts in contrast to a marginal decrease in isolated type II cells. In a single 4-h exposure of 15 healthy humans, to 50mg/m3 of a mixture of 21 common indoor VOCs neither increased inflammatory cells in nasal lavage fluid nor in the induced sputum; furthermore, the inflammatory biomarkers interleukin-8 (IL-8), leukotriene B4 or albumin did not increase (Pappas et al., 2000). In 130 women, a 2-h exposure to 25mg/m3 of a 23 indoor VOC mixture showed no effect on polymorphonuclear cells, total protein, IL-6 and IL-8 in nasal lavage fluid (Laumbach et al., 2005). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone are indirectly related through their involvement in airway inflammation studies. The reaction products of limonene (a VOC) and ozone were shown to upregulate inflammatory markers in lung cells during acute exposure in rats. However, there is no direct mention of 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene's specific interaction with ozone or its effects on inflammation in the provided studies, indicating a lack of detailed connection between the two compounds.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect relationship, as both terms are associated with airway inflammation and VOCs, but there is no direct evidence or detailed discussion of their interaction in the context provided.",
