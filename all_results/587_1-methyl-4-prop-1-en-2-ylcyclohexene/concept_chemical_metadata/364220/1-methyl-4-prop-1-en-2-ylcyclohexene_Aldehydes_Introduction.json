    "context": "However, it still remains unclear how repeated daily exposures to complex low-level indoor air pollutant mixtures influence the eyes and the airways. Limonene is a common and abundant indoor air VOC in offices (Salonen et al., 2009; Schlechter et al., 2004), residences (H\u00e9roux et al., 2008; Hippelein, 2004; J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Takigawa et al., 2010) and beauty salons (Tsigonia et al., 2010); partly, because it is used extensively as fragrance, e.g. in cleaning products and air fresheners (Nazaroff and Weschler, 2004). Limonene has two carbon\u2013carbon double bonds and reacts especially fast with ozone (Weschler, 2000). Identified limonene oxidation products (LOP) include aldehydes, e.g. formaldehyde and acrolein, formic and acetic acid, alcohols, terpene derivatives (Clausen et al., 2001), carbonyl compounds (Forester and Wells, 2009), radicals (Chen and Hopke, 2010; Weschler and Shields, 1997), and secondary organic aerosols (Glasius et al., 2000; Langer et al., 2008; Weschler, 2000; Wolkoff et al., 2008). As the secondary organic aerosol concentration increased significantly during cleaning in a school where a limonene-containing cleaning agent was used (Morawska et al., 2009), this shows that exposures to LOP can occur in typical indoor environments (Wainman et al., 2000). Studies in humans and animals indicate that indoor ozone chemistry is a health concern. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, commonly known as limonene, is discussed in relation to its oxidation products, which include various aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acrolein. The oxidation of limonene in the presence of ozone leads to the formation of these aldehydes, indicating a direct chemical relationship where limonene contributes to the generation of aldehydes as indoor air pollutants. This highlights the potential health implications of limonene exposure in indoor environments.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between limonene and aldehydes, as the context provides evidence of limonene's oxidation leading to the formation of aldehydes, which are relevant indoor air pollutants. This relationship is crucial for understanding indoor air quality and health risks.",
