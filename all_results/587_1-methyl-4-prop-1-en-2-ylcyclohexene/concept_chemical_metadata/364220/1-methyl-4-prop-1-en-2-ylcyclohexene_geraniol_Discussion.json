    "context": "Overall, no exposure-dependent increase was observed in inflammatory cells in the BAL fluids. Indoor air exposures are mixtures of numerous non-reactive VOCs (Brown, 1999) and reactive compounds, including formaldehyde, that may be formed by ozone-initiated reactions with chemically reactive indoor air VOCs (Weschler, 2000; Wolkoff et al., 2006). Ozone reacts rapidly with carbon\u2013carbon bond unsaturated VOCs (alkenes), e.g. fragrance compounds like limonene, \u03b1-terpineol and geraniol (Forester and Wells, 2009), producing a host of oxygenated compounds. Our objective was to investigate how repeated exposure to a mixture, mimicking indoor air, may affect the airways.Airway effects of repeated exposures to limonene In the current study, the only effect of the repeated limonene alone exposures (52ppm) was a decrease in TP. Elongation of TP, a marker of lung edema or a direct chemical stimulation of the lung vagal nerves, was not observed. Neither was rapid shallow breathing observed as TI did not decrease. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and geraniol are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be present in indoor air mixtures. However, the text primarily discusses the reactions of ozone with various unsaturated VOCs, including geraniol, without establishing a direct relationship or interaction between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and geraniol. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than any specific functional or chemical relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both compounds are categorized as VOCs relevant to indoor air quality, but there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other in the context provided.",
