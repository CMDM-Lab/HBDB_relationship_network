    "context": "Exposure levels of measured VOCs are generally low in most buildings (Brown, 1999) and typical indoor concentrations of chemically non-reactive VOCs cannot explain reported complaints in the office environment (Wolkoff et al., 2006) in accordance with a recent human exposure study to terpenes and aldehydes emitted from oriented-strand boards (Gminski et al., 2011). However, it still remains unclear how repeated daily exposures to complex low-level indoor air pollutant mixtures influence the eyes and the airways. Limonene is a common and abundant indoor air VOC in offices (Salonen et al., 2009; Schlechter et al., 2004), residences (H\u00e9roux et al., 2008; Hippelein, 2004; J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Takigawa et al., 2010) and beauty salons (Tsigonia et al., 2010); partly, because it is used extensively as fragrance, e.g. in cleaning products and air fresheners (Nazaroff and Weschler, 2004). Limonene has two carbon\u2013carbon double bonds and reacts especially fast with ozone (Weschler, 2000). Identified limonene oxidation products (LOP) include aldehydes, e.g. formaldehyde and acrolein, formic and acetic acid, alcohols, terpene derivatives (Clausen et al., 2001), carbonyl compounds (Forester and Wells, 2009), radicals (Chen and Hopke, 2010; Weschler and Shields, 1997), and secondary organic aerosols (Glasius et al., 2000; Langer et al., 2008; Weschler, 2000; Wolkoff et al., 2008). As the secondary organic aerosol concentration increased significantly during cleaning in a school where a limonene-containing cleaning agent was used (Morawska et al., 2009), this shows that exposures to LOP can occur in typical indoor environments (Wainman et al., 2000).

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) related to limonene, is indirectly associated with carbon as it is a carbon-containing compound. The discussion focuses on the behavior of VOCs in indoor environments, particularly their reactions and oxidation products, which include various carbon-based compounds. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relevance established between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and carbon beyond their chemical composition.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are related through the broader category of carbon-containing compounds, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific relationship or interactions.",
