    "context": "Exposures were conducted between 10% and 30% RH and between 22 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C (RH/Temp data logger: HOHO Pro, Onset, Burne, MA; monitor: model Testo 625, Hotek Technologies, Tacoma, WA). The mean residual ozone in the exposure chamber was 0.062\u00a0ppm (photometric ozone analyzer, model 1008-AH; Dasabi Environmental Corp, Glendale, CA). Residual d-limonene was not measured. Assuming the reaction of d-limonene and ozone is pseudo-first order (d-limonene levels were much higher than ozone levels), and using the reactor residence time and the rate constant for d-limonene oxidation by ozone (5.1\u00d710\u22126ppb\u22121s\u22121 at 23\u00a0\u00b0C) (Atkinson et al., 1990) the predicted ozone concentration at the exposure chamber entrance is 0.046\u00a0ppm. This is comparable to the measured concentration of 0.062\u00a0ppm. Applying a comparable loss rate for d-limonene, 5.2\u00a0ppm d-limonene is predicted at the entrance of the exposure chamber. Particle number concentrations in the exposure chamber increased immediately after the initiation of the reaction and reached steady state within 10\u201330\u00a0min (TSI 7610 condensation particle counter, CPC, >0.01\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter; Shoreview, MN).

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene (d-limonene) is discussed in relation to its reaction with ozone. The study assumes a pseudo-first order reaction between d-limonene and ozone, indicating that the presence of ozone influences the oxidation process of d-limonene. The measured and predicted ozone concentrations suggest a significant interaction, as the reaction leads to changes in particle number concentrations within the exposure chamber.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between d-limonene and ozone, as the context discusses their reactive relationship and provides quantitative data on their concentrations and reaction rates, indicating a clear interaction within the experimental setup.",
        "score": 4
