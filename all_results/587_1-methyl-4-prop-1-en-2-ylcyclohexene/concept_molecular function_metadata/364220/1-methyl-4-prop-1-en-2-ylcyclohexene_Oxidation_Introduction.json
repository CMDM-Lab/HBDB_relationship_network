    "context": "However, it still remains unclear how repeated daily exposures to complex low-level indoor air pollutant mixtures influence the eyes and the airways. Limonene is a common and abundant indoor air VOC in offices (Salonen et al., 2009; Schlechter et al., 2004), residences (H\u00e9roux et al., 2008; Hippelein, 2004; J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Takigawa et al., 2010) and beauty salons (Tsigonia et al., 2010); partly, because it is used extensively as fragrance, e.g. in cleaning products and air fresheners (Nazaroff and Weschler, 2004). Limonene has two carbon\u2013carbon double bonds and reacts especially fast with ozone (Weschler, 2000). Identified limonene oxidation products (LOP) include aldehydes, e.g. formaldehyde and acrolein, formic and acetic acid, alcohols, terpene derivatives (Clausen et al., 2001), carbonyl compounds (Forester and Wells, 2009), radicals (Chen and Hopke, 2010; Weschler and Shields, 1997), and secondary organic aerosols (Glasius et al., 2000; Langer et al., 2008; Weschler, 2000; Wolkoff et al., 2008). As the secondary organic aerosol concentration increased significantly during cleaning in a school where a limonene-containing cleaning agent was used (Morawska et al., 2009), this shows that exposures to LOP can occur in typical indoor environments (Wainman et al., 2000). Studies in humans and animals indicate that indoor ozone chemistry is a health concern. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, commonly known as limonene, is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes when exposed to ozone. The oxidation of limonene leads to the formation of various products, including aldehydes and secondary organic aerosols, which are significant indoor air pollutants. This highlights the chemical transformation of limonene through oxidation and its implications for indoor air quality and health.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between limonene and oxidation, as the context discusses the oxidation products of limonene and their potential health impacts, supported by evidence of their formation in indoor environments.",
