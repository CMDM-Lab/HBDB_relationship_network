    "context": "In a 140min chamber study, 130 young women were exposed to a VOC mixture with 23 VOCs (total sum=26mg/m3) that contained mainly limonene (0.15ppm) and \u03b1-pinene (0.15ppm) as the unsaturated VOCs. The mixture was used as such or admixed ozone to a steady-state concentration of 0.04ppm. The admixing of ozone did not increase symptom rating (Fiedler et al., 2005). Overall, both animal and human studies suggest a concentration-dependent sensory irritation effect of ozone-initiated limonene oxidation products with a NOEL.Airflow limitation due to repeated exposures to limonene/ozone reaction products In mice, a 1-h exposure to 51ppm limonene admixed 3.4ppm ozone caused airflow limitation that developed slowly over the exposure period (Rohr et al., 2002); the adjusted mid-expiratory flow rate decreased to 73\u201375% of the pre-exposure level after 46\u201360min of exposure. No carry-over effect was apparent 6h after end of the acute exposure. A similar time pattern was observed in this study at the high ozone admixing level, where VD decreased to 77% at 51\u201360min of the exposure. The similar results from the acute and this study support that repeated exposures did not change the sensitivity of the conducting airways at lower LOP levels. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is part of a volatile organic compound (VOC) mixture that undergoes oxidation when exposed to ozone. The study highlights the sensory irritation effects of ozone-initiated oxidation products of limonene, suggesting that similar reactions may occur with other unsaturated VOCs like 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene. However, the specific oxidation pathways or products related to this compound are not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the oxidation of VOCs, including potential reactions involving 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, but does not provide specific details on its oxidation process or products.",
