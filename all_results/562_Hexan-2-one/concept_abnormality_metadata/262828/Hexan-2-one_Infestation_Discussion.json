    "context": "The cosmopolitan brown dog tick, R. sanguinueus s. l., is one of the species making the global problem of ticks and tick-borne diseases more complex. Developing strategies that integrate diverse technologies is an approach that will help manage ticks, and the pathogens they transmit, in a sustainable manner. The use of anti-tick vaccines has been proposed as a way to protect dogs from infestation and tick-borne disease transmission. Our findings provide additional supportive information for the development of a formulation combining benzaldehyde and 2-hexanone to protect dogs susceptible to infestation with R. sanguinueus s. l.. Integrated treatment, in areas where there are tick infestations, that combines anti-tick vaccination with the use of a formulation based on repellents discovered in beagle dogs would protect not only dogs, but also humans from tick parasitism and tick-borne zoonotic pathogens. The increasing need for economic and sustainable technologies to abate odors and industrial gaseous pollutants has gradually shifted the attention to biological waste gas treatment technologies. Despite the wide range of bioreactor configurations, (e.g. biofilter, biotrickling filters, bioscrubbers, activated sludge diffusion, two-phase partitioning systems, etc.), conventional biofilters still constitute the most commonly implemented technology at full scale due to their relative simplicity, lower investment costs and the extensive experience gained in their design and operation over the last 20 years.

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one is mentioned as part of a formulation combined with benzaldehyde aimed at protecting dogs from infestation by the brown dog tick, R. sanguineus s. l. The study suggests that this formulation could enhance the effectiveness of anti-tick vaccines, thereby reducing tick infestations and the transmission of tick-borne diseases. The relationship is significant as it highlights the potential role of Hexan-2-one in pest management strategies.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between Hexan-2-one and infestation, as the formulation's purpose is to protect against tick infestations, supported by the context's focus on integrated pest management strategies.",
        "score": 4
