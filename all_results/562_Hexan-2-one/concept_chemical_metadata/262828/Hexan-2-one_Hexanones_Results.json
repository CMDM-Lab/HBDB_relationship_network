For the latter compound the intercept value was not statistically different from zero (p>0.05, F-test) and there was no evidence (p<0.05, F-test) of curvature for either compound 2-hexanone (p=0.822, F-test) of for benzaldehyde (p=0.207, F-test). The adequacy of the linear model was also assessed in terms of the very high proportion of variance explained (R2), being 98.27% for 2-hexanone and 99.48% for benzaldehyde.Estimation of the quantity of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde produced by the beagles The range in concentration of 2-hexanone in the odour from beagles was 0.633ngmL\u22121 in beagle 1 on the 7th day to 3.405ngmL\u22121 in beagle 3 on the 7th day (Table 1).

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one is specifically mentioned as a compound being analyzed, while Hexanones refers to a broader class of compounds that includes Hexan-2-one. The statistical analysis focuses on the behavior and production of 2-hexanone, indicating that it is a specific instance within the hexanone category. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship beyond this classification.",
