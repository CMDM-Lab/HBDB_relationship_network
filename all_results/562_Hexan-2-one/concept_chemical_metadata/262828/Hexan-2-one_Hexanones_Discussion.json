    "context": "Beagle 1 had a far greater ratio than the other two beagles (Table 2), due to much lower mean concentrations of 2-hexanone over time (Table 1). For 2-hexanone the LOD and the LOQ were found to be 0.092 and 0.278ngmL\u22121 respectively and for benzaldehyde the LOD and the LOQ were found to be 0.270 and 0.819ngmL\u22121 respectively. For benzaldehyde the LOQ was smaller than the first point of the calibration curve (\u22641.00ngmL\u22121) indicating that, assuming linearity, smaller quantities than the smallest calibrated could be estimated from corresponding chromatographic areas, although for robust estimates from the regression analysis it would still be advisable to remain within the limits of the calibration. Here, we report on validation of an analytical method to characterize VOCs that have a repellent effect, and quantify the relatively minor amounts of the tick repellents 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde in the odour of beagles in a consistent and reliable manner and hence also the natural ratio of benzaldehyde to 2-hexanone in the odour. Our results enhance previous findings by documenting the presence of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde in beagle odour samples covering a 7-day period. Previous studies showed that the beagle is resistant to tick infestation and that repellency is associated with host odour components. Although the 1:1 combination of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde was shown to be as repellent as DEET, the in vivo variation in their concentrations over time was not documented. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one (2-hexanone) is specifically mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) analyzed in the odour of beagles, alongside benzaldehyde. Hexanones, as a broader category, include Hexan-2-one, indicating that the study focuses on the repellent properties of these compounds. The relationship is established through the analysis of their concentrations and their role in host odour, which is linked to tick repellency. However, the context does not delve deeply into the chemical interactions or specific functional relationships between Hexan-2-one and other hexanones beyond their classification as VOCs.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as Hexan-2-one is a specific example of hexanones discussed in the context of tick repellency. While they are related through their classification, the context does not provide extensive details on their interactions or specific roles beyond their presence in the study.",
