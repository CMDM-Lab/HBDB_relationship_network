    "context": "Borges et al. found compounds in resistant beagles that could be used in such an approach. However, it has been observed in resistant and susceptible hosts that the naturally occurring association of chemical compounds can blind, mask, or expand the perception of other chemical compounds acting as signals to parasites [20\u201322]. Thus, the combination, or, in mathematical terms, the ratio of compounds in each host can act synergistically or antagonistically against parasites [20,21,23\u201325]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze and quantify the release rate, and the ratio of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde odour in beagles. Odour collection Odour components from one male and two female beagle dogs (all 8 years old) were collected by adapting techniques previously described. Briefly, odour components were adsorbed in a mix of activated charcoal (350mg, 40\u03bcm) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and octadecyl bonded silica (450mg, Bakerbond\u00ae, C18, particle size 40\u03bcm) (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Missouri, USA) that was packed in a piece of filter paper (9\u00d78cm piece of Whatman no. 1 qualitative) (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Little Chalfont, UK) stapled securely to produce an adsorbent sachet (4\u00d74cm). Each adsorbent sachet was encased in a folded piece of stainless steel mesh-wire sheet (100\u03bcm; 5\u00d710cm) that stapled securely together. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are analyzed as components of odour released by beagle dogs. The study aims to quantify the release rates and ratios of these compounds, suggesting that their combination may influence the perception of chemical signals to parasites. However, the specific interactions or effects of these compounds on each other are not detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both Hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are part of the same study focusing on their release rates and potential synergistic or antagonistic effects. However, their direct relationship or interaction is not explicitly discussed.",
        "score": 3
