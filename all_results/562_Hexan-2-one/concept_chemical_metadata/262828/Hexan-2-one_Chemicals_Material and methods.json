The oven temperature was maintained at 30\u00b0C for 0.1min, then programmed to increase at 10\u00b0Cmin\u22121 until 250\u00b0C, and then held for 30min.2-hexanone and benzaldehyde quantification Analytical curves were constructed for determination of the concentration of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde in the dog odour extracts. Primary stock standard solutions of 2-hexanone (Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd., Dorset, UK) and benzaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd., Steinheim, Germany) at a concentration of 1000ngmL\u22121 were prepared using DCM bi-distillate (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, Missouri, USA) as solvent. Stock solutions were diluted serially to reach a concentration of 10ngmL\u22121, which was used to produce five different concentrations of 2-hexanone (2.5, 1.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1ngmL\u22121) and benzaldehyde (6.0, 5.0, 4.0, 2.5 and 1.0ngmL\u22121). Each final concentration was tested in triplicate.One \u03bcL of each solution was injected and analysed by GC-FID using the method as shown in the previous section. This method was adopted to account for technical variation in the calibration procedure. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one (2-hexanone) is mentioned as a chemical being quantified alongside benzaldehyde in dog odour extracts. The focus is on the analytical methods used for determining the concentration of these specific chemicals, indicating that Hexan-2-one is part of a broader category of chemicals being analyzed. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific properties or interactions with other chemicals beyond its inclusion in the quantification process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as Hexan-2-one is categorized as a chemical being analyzed, but there is no detailed exploration of its relationship with other chemicals or its significance in the context.",
