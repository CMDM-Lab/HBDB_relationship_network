Beagle 1 had a far greater ratio than the other two beagles (Table 2), due to much lower mean concentrations of 2-hexanone over time (Table 1). For 2-hexanone the LOD and the LOQ were found to be 0.092 and 0.278ngmL\u22121 respectively and for benzaldehyde the LOD and the LOQ were found to be 0.270 and 0.819ngmL\u22121 respectively. For benzaldehyde the LOQ was smaller than the first point of the calibration curve (\u22641.00ngmL\u22121) indicating that, assuming linearity, smaller quantities than the smallest calibrated could be estimated from corresponding chromatographic areas, although for robust estimates from the regression analysis it would still be advisable to remain within the limits of the calibration. Here, we report on validation of an analytical method to characterize VOCs that have a repellent effect, and quantify the relatively minor amounts of the tick repellents 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde in the odour of beagles in a consistent and reliable manner and hence also the natural ratio of benzaldehyde to 2-hexanone in the odour. Our results enhance previous findings by documenting the presence of 2-hexanone and benzaldehyde in beagle odour samples covering a 7-day period. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their presence in the odour of beagles. The study focuses on validating an analytical method to quantify these compounds, highlighting their relative concentrations and the natural ratio of benzaldehyde to hexan-2-one in the beagle odour samples. However, the specific interactions or functional relationships between the two compounds are not discussed in detail.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde, as they are both VOCs measured in the same study. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship or interactions beyond their co-presence in the odour samples.",
