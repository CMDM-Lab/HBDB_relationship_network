    "context": "It was reported that dogs and hamsters infected by VL seen to be more attractive to diseases transmitter vectors. Some of the compounds identified in the present study were already recognized as attractive to hematophagous mosquitoes. Tetradecane is one of the main exhaled compounds from chicken and it is a potential attractive to Culex annulirostris, a vector of diseases such as Ross River fever, Barman forest virus, Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis. Nonanal elucidated the electrophysiologic and behavior responses of Culex quinquefasciatus, human philariosys vector, while 2-hexanone, benzaldehyde and hexanal were reported as important compounds in L. longipalpis orientation and tridecane to present repellent proprieties to Anoplolepis longipalpis, Sitotroga cerealella and C. quinquefasciatus  . The strategy of multivariate experimental design allowed the identification of the most significant parameters relating to the overall sensitivity and the optimization of experimental conditions for the proposed headspace SPME sampling method with a small number of experiments. The HS-SPME method, coupled with GC\u2013MS analysis, successfully separated more than 250 volatile organic compounds in canine hair, according to the following parameters: polydimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene fiber (PDMS-DVB 65\u03bcm, Supelco, Bellefonte); extraction time 18min; extraction temperature 90\u00b0C; hair mass 130mg; desorption temperature 240\u00b0C; and desorption time 1min. SIMCA and PCA provided visual differences of VOC profiles from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum and healthy dogs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and nonanal are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been studied for their attractiveness to disease-transmitting vectors, particularly mosquitoes. Nonanal is specifically noted for its electrophysiological and behavioral effects on Culex quinquefasciatus, while hexan-2-one is listed among other compounds relevant to vector orientation. However, their direct relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon, indicating a more general association within the study of VOCs and vector attraction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between hexan-2-one and nonanal, as both are identified as VOCs relevant to vector attraction, but there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the context.",
