    "context": "It was reported that dogs and hamsters infected by VL seen to be more attractive to diseases transmitter vectors. Some of the compounds identified in the present study were already recognized as attractive to hematophagous mosquitoes. Tetradecane is one of the main exhaled compounds from chicken and it is a potential attractive to Culex annulirostris, a vector of diseases such as Ross River fever, Barman forest virus, Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis. Nonanal elucidated the electrophysiologic and behavior responses of Culex quinquefasciatus, human philariosys vector, while 2-hexanone, benzaldehyde and hexanal were reported as important compounds in L. longipalpis orientation and tridecane to present repellent proprieties to Anoplolepis longipalpis, Sitotroga cerealella and C. quinquefasciatus  . The strategy of multivariate experimental design allowed the identification of the most significant parameters relating to the overall sensitivity and the optimization of experimental conditions for the proposed headspace SPME sampling method with a small number of experiments. The HS-SPME method, coupled with GC\u2013MS analysis, successfully separated more than 250 volatile organic compounds in canine hair, according to the following parameters: polydimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene fiber (PDMS-DVB 65\u03bcm, Supelco, Bellefonte); extraction time 18min; extraction temperature 90\u00b0C; hair mass 130mg; desorption temperature 240\u00b0C; and desorption time 1min. SIMCA and PCA provided visual differences of VOC profiles from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum and healthy dogs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and n-hexanal are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to the attraction of hematophagous mosquitoes, which are vectors for various diseases. While both compounds are recognized for their significance in the orientation of disease-transmitting vectors, the context does not provide a direct comparison or interaction between Hexan-2-one and n-hexanal, limiting the depth of their relationship.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both Hexan-2-one and n-hexanal are identified as important VOCs in the context of mosquito attraction, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon.",
