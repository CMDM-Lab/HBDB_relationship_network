    "context": "T \u00d7 t, where R means the response, T the extraction temperature, t the extraction time, m the canine hair mass, and T \u00d7 t is the interaction between desorption temperature and time. Fig. 3 illustrates a chromatogram obtained by HS-SPME/GC\u2013MS under optimized conditions for the evaluation of all VOC in canine hair samples. These conditions allowed the detection of 274 chromatographic peaks of VOC from canine hair samples. Of these, 24 were unequivocally identified, based on comparisons made with mass spectra from NIST electronic library and retention times of standards as follow: pentadecane, hexadecane, 2-hexanone, 2-decanone, dodecane, 2-octanone, 2-nonanone, eicosane, 2-octenal, benzaldeide, tridecane, 2-heptenal, heneicosane, nonadecane, heptanal, 2,4-nonadienal, pentadecane, nonanal, decanal, octadecane, heptadecane, tetradecane, hexanal and octanal.Leishmaniasis identification by multivariate analysis The PCA was performed in order to identify grouping tendencies of leishmaniasis infected and non-infected dogs. The results of PCA for the whole data set is depicted in the score graph of first and third principal components (Fig. 4 ) and this pair of PCs was chosen due to better visual grouping tendencies. Nine principal components explained 91, 34% of variance for this data set. The score graph (PC1\u00d7PC3) illustrated in Fig. 4 evidence group tendencies between leishmaniasis infected dogs and non-infected dogs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and caprylic aldehyde are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in canine hair samples through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interaction, or significance in the study, as they are simply listed among other identified VOCs without further elaboration on their roles or connections.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as hexan-2-one and caprylic aldehyde are merely listed as identified VOCs in the study without any specific interaction or relevance discussed between them.",
