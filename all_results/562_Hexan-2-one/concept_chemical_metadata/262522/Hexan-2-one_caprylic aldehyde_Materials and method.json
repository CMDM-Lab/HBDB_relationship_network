    "context": "The volume remaining was put into a tube containing EDTA for subsequent extraction of DNA and implementation of the PCR. Based on these tests, two groups could be separate: a first one with 18 healthy dogs and a second one with 23 dogs infected.Sample collection The hair sample\u2019s length ranged from 1 to 3cm. The samples were collected by cutting hair, close to the skin of dogs that had not been washed for at least 15 days before sampling. The hair samples were stored in sealed plastic bags under refrigeration.Reagents Standard solution of hydrocarbons, C9\u2013C24 (DRH-008S-R2-PAK, AccuStandard, New Haven) and carbonyl compounds (2-hexanone, 2-octanone, 2-nonanone, 2-decanone, benzaldehyde, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, trans-2-heptenal, trans-2-octenal and trans-trans-2,4-nonadienal) were acquired from Sigma\u2013Aldrich, USA.Solid phase microextraction A mass of hair samples, ranging from 30mg to 130mg, was put in sealed 20ml glass vials for VOC headspace microextraction. The vial was then inserted into an aluminum heating block (4cm in height by 14cm in diameter) placed onto a temperature controlled hot plate. The SPME extractions were carried out using polydimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene fiber (PDMS-DVB 65\u03bcm, Supelco, Bellefonte) with a manual holder. This fiber presents an intermediate polarity and when compared to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and the polyacrilate (PA), exhibited a higher efficiency to extract VOC from canine hair. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and caprylic aldehyde are both mentioned as part of a broader study involving the extraction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from canine hair samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interaction, or significance in the context of the study. They are simply listed among other carbonyl compounds and hydrocarbons used in the analysis, indicating they are part of the same experimental framework without further elaboration on their specific roles or connections.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between Hexan-2-one and caprylic aldehyde, as they are merely listed together in the context of a study without any discussion of their interactions or relevance to each other.",
