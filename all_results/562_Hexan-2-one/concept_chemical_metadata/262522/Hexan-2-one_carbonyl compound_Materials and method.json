    "context": "The volume remaining was put into a tube containing EDTA for subsequent extraction of DNA and implementation of the PCR. Based on these tests, two groups could be separate: a first one with 18 healthy dogs and a second one with 23 dogs infected.Sample collection The hair sample\u2019s length ranged from 1 to 3cm. The samples were collected by cutting hair, close to the skin of dogs that had not been washed for at least 15 days before sampling. The hair samples were stored in sealed plastic bags under refrigeration.Reagents Standard solution of hydrocarbons, C9\u2013C24 (DRH-008S-R2-PAK, AccuStandard, New Haven) and carbonyl compounds (2-hexanone, 2-octanone, 2-nonanone, 2-decanone, benzaldehyde, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, trans-2-heptenal, trans-2-octenal and trans-trans-2,4-nonadienal) were acquired from Sigma\u2013Aldrich, USA.Solid phase microextraction A mass of hair samples, ranging from 30mg to 130mg, was put in sealed 20ml glass vials for VOC headspace microextraction. The vial was then inserted into an aluminum heating block (4cm in height by 14cm in diameter) placed onto a temperature controlled hot plate. The SPME extractions were carried out using polydimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene fiber (PDMS-DVB 65\u03bcm, Supelco, Bellefonte) with a manual holder. This fiber presents an intermediate polarity and when compared to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and the polyacrilate (PA), exhibited a higher efficiency to extract VOC from canine hair. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one is mentioned as a specific example of a carbonyl compound among a list of other carbonyls used in the study. The context discusses the extraction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from hair samples, indicating that Hexan-2-one is part of a broader category of carbonyl compounds relevant to the analysis. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific properties or interactions beyond its classification as a carbonyl compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as Hexan-2-one is identified as a carbonyl compound, but the context does not elaborate on any significant interactions or specific roles of Hexan-2-one within the study, merely categorizing it among other carbonyls.",
