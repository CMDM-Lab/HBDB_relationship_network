    "context": "The volume remaining was put into a tube containing EDTA for subsequent extraction of DNA and implementation of the PCR. Based on these tests, two groups could be separate: a first one with 18 healthy dogs and a second one with 23 dogs infected.Sample collection The hair sample\u2019s length ranged from 1 to 3cm. The samples were collected by cutting hair, close to the skin of dogs that had not been washed for at least 15 days before sampling. The hair samples were stored in sealed plastic bags under refrigeration.Reagents Standard solution of hydrocarbons, C9\u2013C24 (DRH-008S-R2-PAK, AccuStandard, New Haven) and carbonyl compounds (2-hexanone, 2-octanone, 2-nonanone, 2-decanone, benzaldehyde, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, trans-2-heptenal, trans-2-octenal and trans-trans-2,4-nonadienal) were acquired from Sigma\u2013Aldrich, USA.Solid phase microextraction A mass of hair samples, ranging from 30mg to 130mg, was put in sealed 20ml glass vials for VOC headspace microextraction. The vial was then inserted into an aluminum heating block (4cm in height by 14cm in diameter) placed onto a temperature controlled hot plate. The SPME extractions were carried out using polydimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene fiber (PDMS-DVB 65\u03bcm, Supelco, Bellefonte) with a manual holder. This fiber presents an intermediate polarity and when compared to the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and the polyacrilate (PA), exhibited a higher efficiency to extract VOC from canine hair. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and decanaldehyde are both mentioned as part of a standard solution of carbonyl compounds used in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) extracted from canine hair samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction, as they are simply listed among other carbonyl compounds without any specific functional or chemical connection highlighted in the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as Hexan-2-one and decanaldehyde are merely listed together in the context of a standard solution without any further discussion of their interactions or relevance to each other.",
