    "context": "It was reported that dogs and hamsters infected by VL seen to be more attractive to diseases transmitter vectors. Some of the compounds identified in the present study were already recognized as attractive to hematophagous mosquitoes. Tetradecane is one of the main exhaled compounds from chicken and it is a potential attractive to Culex annulirostris, a vector of diseases such as Ross River fever, Barman forest virus, Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis. Nonanal elucidated the electrophysiologic and behavior responses of Culex quinquefasciatus, human philariosys vector, while 2-hexanone, benzaldehyde and hexanal were reported as important compounds in L. longipalpis orientation and tridecane to present repellent proprieties to Anoplolepis longipalpis, Sitotroga cerealella and C. quinquefasciatus  . The strategy of multivariate experimental design allowed the identification of the most significant parameters relating to the overall sensitivity and the optimization of experimental conditions for the proposed headspace SPME sampling method with a small number of experiments. The HS-SPME method, coupled with GC\u2013MS analysis, successfully separated more than 250 volatile organic compounds in canine hair, according to the following parameters: polydimethylsiloxane divinylbenzene fiber (PDMS-DVB 65\u03bcm, Supelco, Bellefonte); extraction time 18min; extraction temperature 90\u00b0C; hair mass 130mg; desorption temperature 240\u00b0C; and desorption time 1min. SIMCA and PCA provided visual differences of VOC profiles from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum and healthy dogs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that play a role in the attraction of hematophagous mosquitoes, which are vectors for various diseases. Both compounds are identified as significant in the orientation of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, indicating their potential importance in vector attraction. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or comparative significance between hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde beyond their shared role in attracting disease vectors.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are identified as important VOCs in the context of vector attraction, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon in detail.",
