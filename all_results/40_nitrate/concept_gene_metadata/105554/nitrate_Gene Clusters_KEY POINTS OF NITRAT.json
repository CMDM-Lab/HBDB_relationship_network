    "context": "[1] Nitrate assimilation in Chlamydomonas. [2] (A) Scheme of transporters, reductases, and the regulatory NIT2 protein for nitrate assimilation. [3] The main structural motifs in NIT2 are indicated: the GAF domain, nuclear export sequence (NES), poly-glutamine (Q), and the RWP-RK (RWP) motif. [4] (B) Nitrate gene clusters. [5] Two gene clusters in linkage group IX contain nitrate assimilation genes in Chlamydomonas. [6] The regulatory gene NIT2 is in linkage group III.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to gene clusters involved in its assimilation in Chlamydomonas. The text describes the presence of two gene clusters in linkage group IX that contain nitrate assimilation genes, highlighting the regulatory role of the NIT2 gene located in linkage group III. This indicates a direct relationship between nitrate and the genetic mechanisms governing its assimilation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and gene clusters, as the context provides specific information about the genetic organization and regulation of nitrate assimilation in Chlamydomonas, supported by the mention of specific gene clusters.",
        "score": 4
