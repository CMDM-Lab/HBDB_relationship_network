    "context": "An alternative reason for not observing an effect with sodium nitrate is that the pool of NO was sufficient to mediate hypoxic vascular responses in younger adults. The major source of NO in hypoxia is believed to be from nitrite reduction, or release from nitroso storage pools because global NOS inhibition does not reverse hypoxic induced vasodilation. Upon exposure to high altitude (3520\u00a0m), eNOS expression does in fact decrease over the first 4 days, while nitrites/nitrates concomitantly increase. The fact that the concentration of plasma NOx did not decrease with placebo, or that there were no differences in StO2 following brachial arterial occlusion between placebo and nitrate supplementation suggests that NO metabolism was not significantly altered and a longer hypoxic exposure time may be required to impact NO mediated vascular control. For instance, when a single dose of nitrate (5.0\u00a0mmol) was supplemented on days 7 or 8\u00a0at 3700\u00a0m during a 39\u00a0d mountain expedition, flow mediated dilation was similar to sea level values with nitrate supplementation, but significantly impaired with placebo. We, therefore, cannot exclude the possibility of vascular benefits with nitrate supplementation when the duration of exposure to high altitude is several days to weeks. Although nitrate supplementation has been reported to offer no benefit in reducing symptoms of acute mountain sickness or increasing SaO2 during a sojourn from 2835\u00a0m to 4250\u00a0m, benefits may still exist.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its potential effects on nitric oxide (NO) metabolism and vascular responses during hypoxia, particularly following brachial artery occlusion. The study indicates that nitrate supplementation did not significantly alter NO levels or vascular control as measured by StO2 after occlusion, suggesting that the existing NO pool was sufficient to mediate responses. However, there is a suggestion that prolonged exposure to high altitude may reveal vascular benefits from nitrate supplementation, indicating a complex relationship between nitrate and vascular function.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the interaction between nitrate and vascular responses, specifically in relation to brachial artery occlusion. While there is some evidence of interaction, the effects of nitrate supplementation on vascular control are not definitively established.",
