    "context": "While PENO and circulating plasma NOx were not significantly altered in hypobaric hypoxia with placebo during the current acute altitude exposure, others have reported gradual declines in PENO during the first 3\u00a0d\u00a0at 3800\u00a0m and a substantial decline in plasma NO reaction products following 24\u00a0h\u00a0at 3000\u00a0m. Given nitrate supplementation led to significant increases in plasma NOx, nitrites and PENO in the current investigation, there may be value in exploring this strategy to prevent, or reverse, the decline in PENO and circulating NOx that occurs with more prolonged altitude exposures to help mitigate hypoxic increases in pulmonary arterial pressure. We acknowledge that exhaled NO levels do not reflect pulmonary vascular function, yet an increase in upper airway NO production may increase axial back diffusion of NO into the alveoli and circulation that could offer protection from developing pulmonary hypertension. Although researchers have suggested that changes in pulmonary NO flux, as indicated from exhaled NO measurements, do not appear to significantly contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension during ascent to high altitude, the efficacy of nitrate supplementation in reducing pulmonary arterial pressure remains to be fully explored. In light of not measuring pulmonary arterial pressure, this remains a speculative, yet an attractive hypothesis for future research.Study limitations and strengths There were methodological limitations within the present study that deserve mention. Because two different exercise tests were performed within a very narrow window, we could not measure blood flow and StO2 with both CGrip and RGrip exercise protocols. The strain gauge, wrist and upper arm cuffs had to be fitted to a single arm so that measurements could be made immediately prior to and following CGrip exercise. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its potential effects on pulmonary hypertension, particularly during altitude exposure. Nitrate supplementation is suggested to increase plasma NOx levels, which may help mitigate hypoxic increases in pulmonary arterial pressure. While the study acknowledges that exhaled NO levels do not directly reflect pulmonary vascular function, the hypothesis is that increased NO production could offer protective effects against developing pulmonary hypertension. However, the relationship remains speculative and requires further investigation to confirm its efficacy in reducing pulmonary arterial pressure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and pulmonary hypertension, supported by the discussion of nitrate's role in increasing NOx levels and its potential protective effects against elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. However, the speculative nature of the findings prevents a higher score.",
