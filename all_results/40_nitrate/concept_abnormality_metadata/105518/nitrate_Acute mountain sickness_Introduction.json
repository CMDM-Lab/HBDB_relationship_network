    "context": "The only study describing the effects of oral nitrate supplementation on physiological responses to high altitude exposure found a single beetroot juice drink (5\u00a0mmol) restored endothelial function to pre-trek levels following 3 days of trekking from 1523 to 3700\u00a0m. These studies demonstrate that nitrate supplementation can effectively alter physiological responses to acute normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia. To the authors' knowledge, no literature exists describing the effects of sustained oral nitrate supplementation on the physiological responses to prolonged high altitude exposure, a situation experienced by millions of residents and tourists each year. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the effect of oral nitrate supplementation, in the form of beetroot juice, on basic physiological responses and acute mountain sickness symptoms, in a group of young teenaged males trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp (EBC). Study design The study consisted of a single-blind (participants) parallel group randomised controlled trial, wherein a nitrate supplemented group (n\u00a0=\u00a021), and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a019), ascended from Kathmandu (KTM) to EBC over eleven days. During this time period, daily physiological measurements were obtained, and acute mountain sickness symptoms recorded. The investigator was not blinded from the group allocation as during ascent he was required to monitor the prevalence of AMS in each group to ensure the intervention was not causing adverse effects on the participants' health, however, all measurements were taken by trained participants, rather than the investigator, reducing the chance of bias.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate, specifically from beetroot juice, is investigated for its potential effects on physiological responses and symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) during high-altitude trekking. The study aims to determine whether oral nitrate supplementation can alleviate AMS symptoms and improve physiological function in individuals ascending to high altitudes, suggesting a direct relationship between nitrate intake and AMS management.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate supplementation and acute mountain sickness, as the study specifically investigates how nitrate affects physiological responses and AMS symptoms during high-altitude exposure, supported by a controlled trial design.",
        "score": 4
