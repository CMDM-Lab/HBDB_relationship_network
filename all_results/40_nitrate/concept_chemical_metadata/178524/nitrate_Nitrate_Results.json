    "context": "[4] We measured NOS activity in the jejunum but not in other tissues, which may contribute more significantly to plasma NO2/NO3 in mast cell deficient mice. [5] This possibility, however, is not supported by previously published work which demonstrates that dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) inhibits iNOS activity to a comparable extent in different tissues of the rat after endotoxin treatment. [6] Hence, an alternative explanation for our findings of a sustained elevation in plasma NO2/NO3 and accompanying reduction in iNOS after dexamethasone or aminoguanidine treatment is that the increased plasma NO2/NO3 level in mast cell deficient mice is not related to the elevated jejunal iNOS activity.

[2] *p<0.01 relative to +/+. [1] There is a growing body of evidence that implicates nitric oxide as a modulator of the restrictive properties of the paracellular pathway between intestinal epithelial cells. [2] Using blood to lumen clearance of 51Cr-EDTA as a measure of intestinal mucosal permeability, Kubes and associates have demonstrated that intravascular administration of NO synthase inhibitors such as l-NAME elicit large (fivefold to sixfold) increases in mucosal permeability of both cat and rat intestine.

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically the anion derived from nitric acid. The discussion revolves around the measurement of plasma levels of nitrite and nitrate in various mouse models, indicating their relevance in the study of nitric oxide modulation and intestinal permeability. However, the context does not elaborate on any distinct differences or interactions between the two terms, as they are essentially the same entity in this scientific discussion.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship because 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are used interchangeably in the context without any additional discussion or differentiation, indicating they are merely two representations of the same chemical compound.",
