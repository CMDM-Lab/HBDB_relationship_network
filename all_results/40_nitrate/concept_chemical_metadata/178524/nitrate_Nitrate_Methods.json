    "context": "[3] MPO activity was determined using the method of Grisham et al in jejunal samples of untreated W/WV and +/+ mice. [1] Plasma nitrite and nitrate levels in W/WV and +/+ mice were measured using the method of Grisham et al. [2] Animals were fasted for 24 hours, and a blood sample was collected from the carotid artery. [3] Plasma nitrate and nitrite levels were also measured in dexamethasone or aminoguanidine pretreated W/WV mice under basal conditions. [1] The data were analysed using an analysis of variance with Scheff\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (post hoc) test. [2] When only two groups were compared, the paired or unpaired Student\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s t test was used where appropriate. [3] All values are reported as means (SEM). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically in the measurement of plasma levels in mice. The study involves assessing plasma nitrite and nitrate levels in different mouse models, indicating a focus on the role of these compounds in physiological processes. However, there is no distinct discussion of their relationship beyond the nomenclature.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are simply different representations of the same term without any additional context or functional relationship discussed in the study.",
