    "context": "NO facilitates hypoxic vasodilation to maintain oxygen delivery, and if the synthesis of NO via the l-arginine\u2013NOS pathway is reduced as can occur in hypoxia, consumption of dietary nitrates would provide an immediate source of NO. The dose selected (15\u00a0mmol of nitrate) was based on a previous investigation that examined dose-dependent changes in plasma nitrates, nitrites and cGMP following consumption of a single dose of potassium nitrate. In this investigation, the authors reported an increase in the concentration of plasma nitrates within 20\u00a0min, but a delayed rise in nitrites (1.5\u00a0h) that preceded the increase in cGMP. In the current experiment, the mean time that the participants completed CGrip and RGrip exercise testing at 4300\u00a0m following sodium nitrate consumption was 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0h and 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0h, respectively, times that did not differ following placebo ingestion. Plasma NOx and nitrite levels determined during the time course pilot study conducted at sea level, and during the experiment (hypobaric hypoxia and post-hypobaric hypoxia) suggest that the dosing protocol and timing of the physiological tests occurred when the bioavailability of nitrates and nitrites was enhanced from nitrate supplementation. However, it is of note that the coefficient of variation for the plasma nitrite response to sodium nitrate ingestion was 62% and nearly twice the coefficient of variation for plasma nitrate determined at the same time (27%). While plasma nitrates peaked in hypobaric hypoxia and were sustained following return to sea level, the large inter-individual variability in nitrite responses may have resulted in some subjects being tested at a time point when plasma nitrite levels were suboptimal during the sodium nitrate loading trials.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a dietary source of nitric oxide (NO) that facilitates hypoxic vasodilation, particularly when NO synthesis is compromised. However, Deuterium is not mentioned in relation to nitrate or its physiological effects. The context focuses on the effects of nitrate supplementation on plasma levels and exercise performance, with no direct connection to Deuterium.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between nitrate and Deuterium in the context provided. Deuterium is not discussed or linked to the effects of nitrate or nitric oxide, indicating that their mention is coincidental.",
