    "context": "Subsequent samples were obtained in hypobaric hypoxia and post-hypobaric hypoxia. From the lithium heparin sample, blood was immediately analyzed for hemoglobin (Hb) using an i-STAT Handheld blood analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, IL), whereas EDTA collection tubes were immediately centrifuged at 3800\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min\u00a0at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and the plasma was separated and frozen at\u00a0\u221280\u00a0\u00b0C for later analysis of NO reaction products (NOx) and nitrites. Since there was a significant delay in separating the blood collected in hypobaric hypoxia (\u223c40\u00a0min), plasma nitrite levels for this time point are not reported since nitrites are known to undergo rapid reaction with hemoglobin and likely do not reflect values at time of collection when there are significant delays in sample processing. All testing was conducted in the NSMRL Genesis Hyper/Hypobaric chamber with nitrate and placebo experimental sessions separated by a minimum of 1-week. The mean barometric pressure, temperature and relative humidity were 760\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mmHg, 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C and 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%, respectively, during baseline normobaric and post-hypobaric hypoxia conditions, and 466\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0mmHg (PO2\u00a0=\u00a098\u00a0mmHg), 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u00b0C and 58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% during hypobaric hypoxia. Decompression to 4300\u00a0m was carried out over 60\u00a0min, and recompression to sea level pressure occurred at a decent rate of 305\u00a0m/min.Heart rate, systemic blood pressure and arterial O2 saturation Heart rate and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) were measured by ear lobe pulse oximetry, and systemic blood pressure was determined with a finger plethysmograph (BIOPAC\u00ae NIBP100D noninvasive blood pressure system) from the non-exercising arm. Parameters were continuously monitored on a laptop computer using the MP150 Data Acquisition system and AcqKnowledge Acquisition and Analysis Software version 4.0 (BIOPAC\u00ae Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA).Forearm blood flow In a supine position, left forearm blood flow was determined by strain gauge (indium-gallium) plethysmography (Hokanson, Bellevue, WA).

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, with the latter likely being a typographical emphasis or variation in capitalization. The study discusses the analysis of nitrite and nitrate levels in blood samples during hypobaric hypoxia, indicating their relevance in physiological responses to oxygen levels. However, there is no distinct discussion of their functional relationship beyond their chemical identity.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of substantive relationship between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' as they are essentially the same term. They are mentioned in the context of blood analysis, but no specific interaction or functional relevance is provided.",
