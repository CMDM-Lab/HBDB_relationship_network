There were no differences between baseline CGrip (p\u00a0=\u00a00.122) and RGrip (p\u00a0=\u00a00.493) exercise performed on placebo and sodium nitrate testing days. Mean CGrip and RGrip exercise performance did not differ between placebo and nitrate trials (Fig.\u00a01 A and B), however, there was a mean decrease in CGrip exercise in hypobaric hypoxia (\u221210 \u00b1\u00a05%) and post-hypobaric hypoxia (\u221210 \u00b1\u00a04%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and a 9 \u00b1\u00a02% reduction in RGrip exercise performance in hypobaric hypoxia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There were no significant correlations between the relative changes in plasma NOx and nitrites following ingestion of the sodium nitrate drink and the relative changes in CGrip and RGrip exercise performance in hypobaric hypoxia or post-hypobaric hypoxia (data not shown).Physiological responses to CGrip exercise Physiological responses to the CGrip exercise are shown in Table\u00a04 . During CGrip exercise performed in hypobaric hypoxia, sodium nitrate resulted in a 7 \u00b1\u00a03% reduction in MAP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), whereas heart rate increased by 13 \u00b1\u00a04% with placebo (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Independent of treatment, CGrip exercise completed in hypobaric hypoxia led to reductions in SaO2 ( \u2212 17 \u00b1\u00a02%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and blood flow ( \u2212 33 \u00b1\u00a08%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and a decrease in oxygen delivery ( \u2212 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).Physiological responses to RGrip exercise The mean values for MAP, heart rate, SaO2 and StO2 recorded during RGrip exercise up to 60% of MVC are presented in Table\u00a05 .

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically sodium nitrate, which is being tested for its effects on exercise performance under hypobaric hypoxia conditions. The study examines physiological responses to nitrate ingestion, including changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate during exercise, indicating a direct relationship as they are essentially the same term used in different contexts.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate', as they are the same compound being investigated for its physiological effects in the study. The context clearly shows their relevance in the experimental setup.",
