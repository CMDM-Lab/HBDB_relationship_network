    "context": "Our hypothesis was that by increasing NO bioactive product availability through acute nitrate supplementation, forearm blood flow and tissue oxygenation will be enhanced and forearm exercise performance at high altitude will be improved. Subjects Ten healthy, recreationally active, adults (9 males, 1 female) with a mean (\u00b1SEM) age of 33.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1 years, weight of 85.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0kg, height of 179.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0cm, and a body mass index of 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122 volunteered to participate in this research. All subjects resided at sea level and were unacclimatized to high altitude. Twenty-four hours prior to the experiments, subjects were instructed to avoid high nitrite and nitrate containing foods (provided a list), alcohol, mouthwash, and refrain from exercise. All study participants provided written informed consent prior to completing the study that was approved by the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory's (NSMRL) Institutional Review Board (protocol NSMRL2013.0003) in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects.Study design In a double-blinded randomized-cross over manner, participants completed pre-intervention testing at sea level (baseline), followed by testing in hypobaric hypoxia (4300\u00a0m equivalent) and post-hypobaric hypoxia at sea level after consuming a single bolus of 500\u00a0mL of a placebo (sodium chloride, 14\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 body weight) or nitrate (sodium nitrate, 20\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 body weight, \u223c15\u00a0mmols of nitrate) drink. This dose was selected based on previous research, and a pilot study conducted in a subset of subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a03) that assessed the responses of nitric oxide reaction products (NOx), nitrites and exhaled nitric oxide (PENO) over 5\u00a0h following ingestion of 500\u00a0mL of sodium nitrate (20\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121). The experimental testing timeline and variables measured are described below and presented in Table\u00a01 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are related through their roles in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and vascular function. The study investigates the effects of acute nitrate supplementation on forearm blood flow and exercise performance, with nitrite being a key product of nitrate metabolism. The relationship is significant as nitrite can be converted to nitric oxide, which is crucial for enhancing blood flow and oxygenation during exercise, particularly at high altitudes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between nitrate and nitrite, as the study emphasizes their metabolic relationship and the physiological implications of nitrate supplementation on blood flow and exercise performance, supported by experimental design and context.",
        "score": 4
