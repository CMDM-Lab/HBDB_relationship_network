    "context": "The TSI\u00ae 400 series mass flow sensor meter (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN) used to monitor the expired flow was calibrated by passing a fixed volume of gas through the sensor using a 3 liter calibrated syringe. The Sievers NO analyzer and TSI\u00ae 400 series mass flow sensor were recalibrated at 4300\u00a0m for hypobaric hypoxic measurements, and then again upon return to normobaric normoxia. PENO values are reported as partial pressures in order to compare measurements obtained in normobaric and hypobaric conditions.Plasma NOx and nitrites Plasma was filtered through pre-rinsed (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0with ultrapure water) 10\u00a0kDa cutoff filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) and centrifuged at 14,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min. Total plasma nitrites, nitrates and nitrosothiols (NOx) were determined in 2.5\u00a0\u03bcL of diluted (1:10) plasma using vanadium (III) chloride reduction and chemiluminescence detection (Sievers Nitric Oxide Analyzer 280i, GE Analytical Instruments, Boulder, CO) as previously described. Plasma nitrites were determined by reducing nitrates to nitrites with nitrate reductase (10\u00a0\u03bcL of 1U/mL) and NADPH (10\u00a0\u03bcL of 120\u00a0\u03bcM) for 1\u00a0h\u00a0at room temperature, reacting with 2,3-diaminonapthalene (10\u00a0\u03bcL of 316\u00a0\u03bcM) for 10\u00a0min\u00a0at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, and measuring the fluorescence (excitation 375\u00a0nm, emission 450\u00a0nm) of 2,3-naphthotriazole (15\u00a0\u03bcL injection volume) using high-performance liquid chromatography (Waters Separation module e2695, Waters Corp, Milford, MA) with a fluorescence detector (Waters Multi \u03bb Fluorescence Detector, Waters Corp, Milford, MA).Calculations PENO values were converted from a fractional concentration in ppb to a partial pressure using the following calculation ((barometric pressure  \u2212 47\u00a0mm Hg)  \u00d7 PENO (ppb)  \u00f7 1000). Subjects were unable to complete all of the RGrip stages so an RGrip endurance index (%RGrip) was calculated as the final workload completed (% MVC)  + [(the duration of the final workload attempted (s) \u00f7 120)  \u00d7 10]. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was calculated as ((2  \u00d7 diastolic blood pressure)  + systolic blood pressure)  \u00f7 3. Vascular resistance was calculated as mean arterial blood pressure  \u00f7 forearm blood flow. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and chlorides are both mentioned as components analyzed in plasma samples, but their specific relationship is not detailed. Nitrate is measured as part of the total plasma nitrites and nitrates (NOx), while chlorides are not explicitly discussed in relation to nitrate. The context focuses on the methodology for measuring these substances rather than their interaction or significance together.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both nitrate and chlorides are part of the broader analysis of plasma components, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction in the context provided.",
