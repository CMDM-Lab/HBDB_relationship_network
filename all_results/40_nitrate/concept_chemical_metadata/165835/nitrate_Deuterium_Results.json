    "context": "Values of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered statistically significant. Plasma NOx, nitrites and PENO During pilot testing under normobaric normoxia in a subset of volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a03), the mean concentration of plasma NOx peaked \u223c13-fold over baseline levels within 60\u00a0min of ingestion of sodium nitrate, and remained elevated (>9-fold) over 5\u00a0h. Mean plasma nitrite levels more than doubled within 60\u00a0min of consuming the sodium nitrate drink, but showed great individual variation in both peak increase (40\u2013240%) and the time course of peak response (60\u2013180\u00a0min). Similarly, PENO levels approximately doubled within 60\u00a0min of consuming the sodium nitrate drink but returned to pre-drink PENO levels between 2.5\u00a0h and 3.5\u00a0h post-drink. During the experimental trials, sodium nitrate increased plasma NOx levels \u223c10-fold 102\u00a0min and 8-fold 206\u00a0min following ingestion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) (Table\u00a02 ). Plasma nitrites showed a similar response to that documented in the pilot study, increasing \u223c2-fold over baseline levels 206\u00a0min following consumption of the sodium nitrate solution (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In addition to the plasma responses, sodium nitrate increased PENO (24%) during hypobaric hypoxia testing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and remained significantly elevated during post-altitude testing. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its effects on plasma NOx and nitrite levels following ingestion, but there is no mention of Deuterium or its role in the study. The focus is primarily on the physiological responses to sodium nitrate consumption, with no direct connection or relevance to Deuterium established in the provided information.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between nitrate and Deuterium, as Deuterium is not mentioned in the context of the effects of nitrate on plasma levels, indicating no direct or indirect relevance.",
