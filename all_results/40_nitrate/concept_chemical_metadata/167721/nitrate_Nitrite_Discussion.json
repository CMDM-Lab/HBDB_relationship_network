    "context": "4.2.1 Salivary nitrate and nitrite The measurements of nitrate and nitrite in saliva were performed to further substantiate the role of oral bacteria on exhaled NO. The salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio in vivo was calculated to depict the nitrate reducing activity of the oral bacteria and in the in vitro experiments generation of NO from nitrate was measured to see if also NO generation from nitrate was affected by oxygen. Indeed, high oxygen tension reduced salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio in vivo and NO generation from nitrate in vitro. The reduction in the salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio by HBO2 was mainly due to an increase in salivary nitrate. The most likely explanation is accumulation of nitrate in saliva due to reduced bacterial consumption of nitrate and subsequent less generation of NO. Circulating nitrate is actively taken up by the salivary glands but since plasma levels of nitrate were unchanged by HBO2 this cannot explain the increased levels in saliva. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that a more efficient salivary gland uptake occurred during HBO2. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are closely related as they are both measured in saliva to assess the role of oral bacteria in the generation of nitric oxide (NO). The salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio indicates the activity of oral bacteria in reducing nitrate to nitrite. The study highlights how high oxygen tension affects this ratio, suggesting that increased salivary nitrate levels may result from reduced bacterial consumption of nitrate, thereby influencing NO generation. This relationship underscores the biochemical interplay between nitrate and nitrite in the context of oral microbiota and NO production.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrite, supported by evidence of their roles in the salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio and the generation of NO. The context provides insights into how oxygen levels influence their relationship, indicating a clear biochemical interaction.",
