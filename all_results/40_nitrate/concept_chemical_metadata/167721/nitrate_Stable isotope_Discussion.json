    "context": "In contrast to the levels of nitrate and nitrite these findings suggest a stimulated NOS-dependent NO generation by HBO2. However, the citrulline/arginine ratio increased also in controls in EXP 1 and with respect to cGMP there was no control group in EXP 2. In addition, other endogenous mediators such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can stimulate cGMP production. Earlier studies in experimental models have shown increased plasma levels of NOx (nitrate\u2009+\u2009nitrite) after acute and chronic HBO2 but based on our findings and the appreciation of the possible effect of HBO2 on the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, these findings have to be interpreted with some caution. The use of stable isotopes of L-arginine, nitrate and nitrite would perhaps better elucidate the effects of HBO2 on NO generation and metabolism. There are limitations to the present study. EXP 2 was not blinded to the volunteers and lacked a control group. These experiments were performed in order to investigate markers of NO generation in saliva and plasma also during HBO2 exposure and indeed these experiments revealed that plasma nitrite and cGMP were affected during HBO2 but returned to baseline levels immediately after exposure.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and stable isotopes are discussed in relation to the investigation of nitric oxide (NO) generation and metabolism during hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) exposure. The use of stable isotopes of nitrate, along with L-arginine and nitrite, is suggested as a method to better understand the effects of HBO2 on the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. This indicates a potential analytical relationship where stable isotopes could enhance the study of nitrate's role in NO production.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate and stable isotopes are connected through the proposed use of stable isotopes to elucidate the effects of HBO2 on nitrate metabolism. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond this suggestion.",
