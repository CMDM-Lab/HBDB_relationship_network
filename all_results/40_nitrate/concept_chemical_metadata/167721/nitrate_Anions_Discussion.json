    "context": "However, in these models NO generation from the oral cavity was not considered but still included in the calculation of the bronchial compartment during oral exhalation. We and others have previously shown that NO from the oral cavity can contribute up to 50% of the NO levels in orally exhaled air and this component can be markedly reduced by temporary inhibition of bacterial activity by the use of an antibacterial mouthwash. Facultative anaerobic bacteria, residing in the crypts of the tongue, have potent molybden-containing nitrate and nitrite reductases that are inhibited by molecular oxygen. In addition, they respire on salivary nitrate and nitrite during anaerobic conditions, thereby reducing these anions to NO. Upon high oxygen tension these two processes are disrupted and nitrate and nitrite reduction to NO is gravely inhibited. The present data suggest that the reduction in oral FENO after HBO2 can be explained by disruption of the anaerobic nitrate/nitrite reducing capacity of these oral bacteria. This conclusion is supported by the fact that salivary conversion of nitrate to nitrite was reduced both during and after HBO2 (decreased nitrite/nitrate ratio) and also by the findings in vitro in which both nitrite and NO generation from nitrate in suspensions of oral bacteria were markedly reduced during exposure to 100% oxygen. NO is oxidized to NO2 in the presence of O2 in second order dependence on [NO]. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a substrate for facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity, which can reduce nitrate and nitrite (both anions) to nitric oxide (NO) under anaerobic conditions. The study highlights how the presence of oxygen disrupts this reduction process, leading to decreased levels of these anions and subsequently affecting nitric oxide generation during oral exhalation. Thus, nitrate and anions are interconnected through their biochemical transformation by oral bacteria, particularly in varying oxygen conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and anions, as the context provides evidence of their biochemical relationship through bacterial activity and the impact of oxygen levels on their reduction processes. This relationship is crucial for understanding nitric oxide generation in the oral cavity.",
