    "context": "First suspensions of oral tongue bacteria with addition of nitrate were bubbled with nitrogen, air and oxygen and the generation of nitrite was measured. Bubbling with air led to a 35% reduction of the bacterial conversion of nitrate to nitrite compared to nitrogen-bubbling. With oxygen the effect was much greater, showing a 65% reduction compared to nitrogen (Fig.\u20096A ). Moreover, when nitrate was incubated with bacteria-containing saliva in nitrogen substantial amounts of NO gas were generated (Fig.\u20096B). This effect was almost abolished in the presence of 100% oxygen (Fig.\u20096B). The decrease in nitrite/nitrate ratio in saliva observed during HBO2 treatment could be due to rapid oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in vivo. However, when nitrite was exposed to 100% oxygen for 1\u2009h in vitro there was no loss of nitrite and no measurable generation of nitrate (not shown), indicating minimal oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (Fig.\u20096C).

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrogen are related through their roles in bacterial metabolism. The study investigates how different gas environments (nitrogen, air, and oxygen) affect the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by oral tongue bacteria. Nitrogen serves as an inert gas that enhances the bacterial conversion process, while oxygen significantly inhibits it. The generation of nitric oxide (NO) from nitrate in the presence of nitrogen further illustrates the biochemical interactions between these two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrogen, as the study provides evidence of their interaction in bacterial metabolism, showing how nitrogen influences the conversion of nitrate to nitrite. This relationship is supported by quantitative data on the effects of different gases.",
