    "context": "This conclusion has been based on the use of a two-compartment model of airway NO generation (bronchial and alveolar). However, in these models NO generation from the oral cavity was not considered but still included in the calculation of the bronchial compartment during oral exhalation. We and others have previously shown that NO from the oral cavity can contribute up to 50% of the NO levels in orally exhaled air and this component can be markedly reduced by temporary inhibition of bacterial activity by the use of an antibacterial mouthwash. Facultative anaerobic bacteria, residing in the crypts of the tongue, have potent molybden-containing nitrate and nitrite reductases that are inhibited by molecular oxygen. In addition, they respire on salivary nitrate and nitrite during anaerobic conditions, thereby reducing these anions to NO. Upon high oxygen tension these two processes are disrupted and nitrate and nitrite reduction to NO is gravely inhibited. The present data suggest that the reduction in oral FENO after HBO2 can be explained by disruption of the anaerobic nitrate/nitrite reducing capacity of these oral bacteria. This conclusion is supported by the fact that salivary conversion of nitrate to nitrite was reduced both during and after HBO2 (decreased nitrite/nitrate ratio) and also by the findings in vitro in which both nitrite and NO generation from nitrate in suspensions of oral bacteria were markedly reduced during exposure to 100% oxygen.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and molecular oxygen are related through the metabolic processes of facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity. These bacteria utilize salivary nitrate and nitrite to produce nitric oxide (NO) under anaerobic conditions. However, the presence of molecular oxygen inhibits this reduction process, leading to decreased NO generation. The study highlights how high oxygen tension disrupts the bacteria's ability to convert nitrate and nitrite to NO, thereby affecting the levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO).",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and molecular oxygen, as the context provides evidence of how oxygen inhibits the bacterial reduction of nitrate to NO, impacting physiological processes related to exhaled nitric oxide levels.",
