    "context": "Gas samples (5\u2009ml) were taken out at different time points during 5\u2009h and NO was analyzed with chemiluminescence (77 AM, Eco Physics, Switzerland). 2.4.3 Oxidation of nitrite 1.5\u2009ml Eppendorf tubes (n\u2009=\u20094) containing 500\u2009\u00b5M nitrite in PBS were bubbled with 100% oxygen for two minutes, sealed and incubated for 1\u2009h in 37\u2009\u00b0C. Nitrite and nitrate were measured before and after the incubation using HPLC/ENO-20 as described earlier. 2.4.4 NO stability in high oxygen tension NO gas was adjusted to a concentration of 100\u2009pbb in gas tight bags (Infubags, S.E Nundel Kunstoff-Technik GmbH, Germany) containing 100% oxygen. 20\u2009ml gas samples were taken out at different time points during 5\u2009h and directly analyzed with chemiluminescence.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are discussed in relation to their measurement and analysis during experiments involving gas samples and oxygen exposure. Both terms refer to nitrogen oxides, with nitrate being the oxidized form of nitrite. The study focuses on the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate, indicating a direct chemical relationship between the two compounds as they are part of the same biochemical process being analyzed.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrite, as the context discusses their interconversion and measurement in a biochemical experiment. This indicates a clear relationship within the context of nitrogen oxide chemistry.",
        "score": 4
