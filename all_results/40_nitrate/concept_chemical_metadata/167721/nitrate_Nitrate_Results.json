    "context": "Moreover, when nitrate was incubated with bacteria-containing saliva in nitrogen substantial amounts of NO gas were generated (Fig.\u20096B). This effect was almost abolished in the presence of 100% oxygen (Fig.\u20096B). The decrease in nitrite/nitrate ratio in saliva observed during HBO2 treatment could be due to rapid oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in vivo. However, when nitrite was exposed to 100% oxygen for 1\u2009h in vitro there was no loss of nitrite and no measurable generation of nitrate (not shown), indicating minimal oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (Fig.\u20096C). Finally, the reduction in exhaled NO found after HBO2 treatment in vivo could be due to oxidation of gaseous NO to NO2 during high oxygen tensions. However, when we incubated NO gas (100\u2009ppb) in pure oxygen for 5\u2009h we found only a slight reduction of NO (\u22127%, Fig.\u20096D). Together, these data indicate that HBO2-induced reduction in oral FENO depend to a high degree on inhibition of NO generation by oral bacteria. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, highlighting its role in the generation of nitric oxide (NO) gas when incubated with bacteria-containing saliva. The study discusses the dynamics of nitrate and nitrite in the presence of oxygen, indicating their interconversion and the impact of high oxygen levels on NO production. The relationship is primarily chemical, focusing on the behavior of nitrate in biological systems.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between nitrate and Nitrate, as they are the same compound discussed in the context of NO generation and its biochemical interactions. The context provides strong support for their relevance in physiological processes.",
