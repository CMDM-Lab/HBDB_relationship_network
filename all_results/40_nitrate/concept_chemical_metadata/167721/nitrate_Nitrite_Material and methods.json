    "context": "Sampling occurred after 20 minutes of supine rest before exposure, during exposure at the end of each breathing gas period (except for the second air period) and directly after hyperbaric exposure. A late sample was also collected during supine rest 60 minutes after exposure. Samples were kept on ice during lock-out and during a 5\u20137\u2009min delay before centrifugation. Saliva (3\u20134\u2009ml) was sampled before exposure, immediately after the second HBO2-period at 250\u2009kPa and directly after exposure.Laboratory methods 2.3.1 Nitrate and nitrite in plasma and saliva (EXP 1 and EXP 2) Blood and saliva samples were collected in prechilled vacuum tubes containing EDTA (250\u2009mM, 40\u2009\u00b5L per mL blood). The tubes were immediately centrifuged at 2000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10 minutes at +4\u2009\u00b0C, and aliquots of plasma and saliva were frozen (\u221220\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u20138\u2009hrs and then at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C) until analyzed. Nitrate and nitrite were determined by chemiluminescence after reductive cleavage and subsequent release of NO into the gas phase as described earlier in detail. In brief, plasma or saliva samples were introduced into a reaction vessel purged with nitrogen containing reducing solutions (iodine-iodide) and release of NO was analyzed by chemiluminescence (NO analyzer CLD 77AM, Ecophysics, D\u00fcrnten, Switzerland).

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are analyzed as part of a study involving blood and saliva samples collected during hyperbaric exposure. The laboratory methods detail the determination of both compounds through chemiluminescence after reductive cleavage, indicating a direct relationship where nitrate can be converted to nitrite in biological samples. This suggests their interconnected roles in physiological processes, particularly in the context of nitric oxide (NO) production.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrite, as the context describes their analysis in the same experimental setup, highlighting their biochemical relationship in the context of nitric oxide production. The methodology indicates a clear interaction between the two compounds.",
        "score": 4
