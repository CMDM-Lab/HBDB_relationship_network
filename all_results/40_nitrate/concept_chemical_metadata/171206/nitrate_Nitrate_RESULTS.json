    "context": "[3] Wyke8 bands were not detectable after 20 days at all ammonia concentrations and disappeared earlier at high ammonia (Fig. 4c). [1] DNA-DGGE and 12C-labeled DNA-SIP-DGGE profiles were again similar, with the exception of samples taken at days 10 and 20 at high ammonia. [2] At low ammonia, 13C-labeled DNA-SIP-DGGE profiles were dominated by Wyke2 and EnI299, which were first detected after incubation for 5 days, before detectable nitrite/nitrate production. [3] At intermediate and high ammonia, only Nitrosospira strain EnI299 was detected in 13C-labeled DNA-SIP-DGGE profiles, with initial detection at 10 days, again before detectable nitrite/nitrate production. [4] The data therefore indicate that the community was dominated by a single strain at intermediate and high ammonia, but two members of the community grew at low ammonia. [1] Inhibition by ammonia.Phylogenetic analysis of AOB sequences from laboratory isolates and enrichments and from environmental clones provides support for the existence of several Nitrosospira clusters linked to environmental origin and physiology . [2] Of particular relevance to this study is sensitivity to high ammonia concentrations of members of Nitrosospira cluster 3a and tolerance within cluster 3b . ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' appear to refer to the same chemical compound, with no distinction made between them. The text discusses the production of nitrite/nitrate in relation to ammonia concentrations and microbial community dynamics, but does not elaborate on any specific relationship or functional differences between the two terms. They are used interchangeably without further context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are simply mentioned in the context without any discussion of their relationship or differences. They are treated as synonymous terms without additional relevance.",
