    "context": "[7] The cluster 3a strain Nitrosospira sp. [8] En13 was the only noncluster 3b strain that grew at all ammonia concentrations; but growth at the high ammonia concentration was preceded by an extended lag phase of approximately 10 days, and there was little evidence of growth after 25 days (Fig. 1). [9] This strain is therefore considered, for the purposes of this study, to be ammonia sensitive. [1] Changes in nitrite/nitrate concentration during growth of eight Nitrosospira strains on inorganic medium with initial ammonium concentrations of 3.6 (\u00e2\u2013\u00aa), 14.3 (\u00e2\u2013\u00a1), or 71.4 (\u00e2\u2013\u00b4) mM NH4+. [2] Growth was assessed by production of nitrite/nitrate, and plotted data represent means of measurements from triplicate flasks. [3] Error bars represent standard errors. [1] Information on ammonia sensitivity of the eight Nitrosospira strains was used to construct three communities of two or three ammonia oxidizers with similar nitrite/nitrate production rates at low ammonia but with different responses to intermediate and high ammonia.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are related through their roles in the growth of Nitrosospira strains, particularly in ammonia oxidation processes. The study assesses how varying concentrations of ammonium affect the production of nitrite and nitrate during the growth of these strains. The relationship indicates that ammonium serves as a substrate for the nitrifying bacteria, which convert it into nitrite and subsequently nitrate, highlighting their interconnected roles in nitrogen cycling.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and ammonium, as the study discusses their roles in the growth and metabolic processes of Nitrosospira strains, supported by experimental data on nitrite/nitrate production in response to ammonium concentrations.",
        "score": 4
