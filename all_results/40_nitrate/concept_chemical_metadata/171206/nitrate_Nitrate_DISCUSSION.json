    "context": " [2] Detection of differences by DNA-DGGE requires sufficient growth for detectable changes in relative abundance, as indicated by relative band intensity.  [3] RNA-DGGE might be expected to increase sensitivity through earlier changes as increased ribosome synthesis will precede DNA replication, and changes may be accentuated through greater ribosome copy number.  [4] SIP, however, showed significant advantages over other methods for a number of reasons.  [5] First, it was capable of detecting ammonia-oxidizing activity through incorporation of [13C]CO2 into ammonia oxidizer 16S rRNA gene sequences before detection of significant changes in nitrite/nitrate concentrations.  [6] Second, the data demonstrate the relatively poor resolution of traditional DNA-DGGE approaches.  [7] Although changes were observed in the relative intensities of DNA-DGGE bands, corresponding to relative abundance of different community members, these occurred later than the appearance of bands in 13C-labeled DNA-SIP-DGGE profiles.  [8] More importantly, DNA-DGGE profiles do not distinguish between dormant and active strains or between increased band relative intensities due to growth of a particular strain or death of others.

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, with the latter being a capitalized form that may indicate a specific context or emphasis. The discussion revolves around the detection of changes in nitrate concentrations in relation to ammonia-oxidizing activity and the effectiveness of different detection methods. However, there is no distinct relationship or interaction between the two terms beyond their identity as the same compound.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are simply two forms of the same term without any additional context or discussion of their relationship. They appear coincidentally in the text without any functional or chemical relevance.",
