    "context": "This study found that twice daily supplementation of dietary nitrate (via beetroot juice ingestion) does not reduce or increase the prevalence of symptoms of AMS or alter key physiological variables, in a group of adolescent males during a high altitude trekking expedition when compared to a control group receiving no nitrate supplementation. The study demonstrated that dietary nitrate supplementation at altitude is both feasible and safe. The study was however limited by both its modest sample size and lack of measurement of circulating NO metabolite concentrations. In view of the important role of NO in the physiological response to hypoxia, and given the limitations of this study, these findings should be considered preliminary, and further, adequately powered studies into the efficacy of dietary nitrate supplementation for improving tolerance to high altitude hypoxia are feasible and may be justified.

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same compound, specifically dietary nitrate derived from beetroot juice. The study investigates the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation on symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and physiological variables in adolescent males at high altitude. However, the terms are used interchangeably without any distinct discussion of their relationship beyond this identification.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are simply different representations of the same term without any additional context or functional relationship discussed in the study.",
