    "context": "The only study describing the effects of oral nitrate supplementation on physiological responses to high altitude exposure found a single beetroot juice drink (5\u00a0mmol) restored endothelial function to pre-trek levels following 3 days of trekking from 1523 to 3700\u00a0m. These studies demonstrate that nitrate supplementation can effectively alter physiological responses to acute normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia. To the authors' knowledge, no literature exists describing the effects of sustained oral nitrate supplementation on the physiological responses to prolonged high altitude exposure, a situation experienced by millions of residents and tourists each year. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the effect of oral nitrate supplementation, in the form of beetroot juice, on basic physiological responses and acute mountain sickness symptoms, in a group of young teenaged males trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp (EBC). Study design The study consisted of a single-blind (participants) parallel group randomised controlled trial, wherein a nitrate supplemented group (n\u00a0=\u00a021), and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a019), ascended from Kathmandu (KTM) to EBC over eleven days. During this time period, daily physiological measurements were obtained, and acute mountain sickness symptoms recorded. The investigator was not blinded from the group allocation as during ascent he was required to monitor the prevalence of AMS in each group to ensure the intervention was not causing adverse effects on the participants' health, however, all measurements were taken by trained participants, rather than the investigator, reducing the chance of bias.

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same compound, specifically in the form of oral nitrate supplementation through beetroot juice. The study investigates the physiological effects of nitrate on responses to high altitude exposure, indicating that nitrate supplementation can enhance endothelial function and potentially alleviate symptoms of acute mountain sickness. The terms are used interchangeably, emphasizing the significance of nitrate in the study's focus on physiological adaptations to hypoxia.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate', as they denote the same substance being studied for its physiological effects in the context of high altitude exposure. The context provides strong support for their relevance.",
        "score": 5
