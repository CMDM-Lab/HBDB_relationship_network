    "context": "Participants recorded their measurements in pairs with an investigator available for advice.Intervention Participants in the intervention (dietary nitrate supplementation) arm of the study consumed 140\u00a0ml of concentrated beetroot juice (Beet it, James White Drinks, Ipswich, UK), containing approximately 10\u00a0mmol of nitrate daily. Those in the control arm consumed the same volume of a concentrated blackcurrant juice cordial (with negligible nitrate content) which was bottled and administered in the same way as the beetroot juice. For logistical reasons we only took sufficient amount of juice for the participants to have seven days of supplementation. As such, drinks were taken for the first seven days at high altitude (days 2\u20138), in two equal doses of 5\u00a0mmol nitrate each; one in the morning with breakfast, and one in the evening with dinner.Statistical analysis Descriptive characteristics are presented as frequencies (i.e., n (%)) for symptoms of AMS (i.e. headache, gastrointestinal symptoms and feelings of fatigue and dizziness, and sleep disorder), and as mean (SD) for physiological measurements (i.e. age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), SpO2, ventilatory and heart rate). Normality was tested using histograms and P-P plots. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same compound, specifically in the setting of dietary nitrate supplementation through beetroot juice. The study investigates the effects of nitrate on participants' physiological measurements and symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS). The use of both terms indicates a focus on the same substance, emphasizing its role in the intervention arm of the study.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate', as they are the same compound being studied for its physiological effects in the context of dietary supplementation. The context clearly indicates their relevance in the intervention.",
        "score": 5
