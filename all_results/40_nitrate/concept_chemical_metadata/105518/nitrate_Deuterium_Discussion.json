    "context": "This is supported somewhat by Casey et\u00a0al. who found no effect of nitrate supplementation on heart rate, blood pressure, and SPO2 during very acute (<10\u00a0min) normobaric hypoxic exposure.Limitations A significant limitation of this study was that, secondary to logistical constraints, we were not able to measure circulating NO metabolite concentrations. Accordingly, we are unable to confirm that the dietary nitrate supplementation regime was successful in enhancing NO availability. Previous studies using a similar protocol (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070\u00a0ml/day of concentrated beetroot juice produced by the same manufacturer), did find ingestion to increase plasma nitrate and nitrite levels, however in these,; however in these, the final dose of beetroot juice was consumed 2.5\u00a0h before blood was taken and physiological variables were measured, potentially ensuring the acute effects of the supplementation were present. In our study, the second beetroot juice of the day was consumed in the evening, with measurements undertaken the following morning approximately twelve hours later. A second limitation was that we did not measure the actual nitrate concentration of beetroot juice utilised in this study, but rather relied on data provided by the manufacturer. Although we have no reason to doubt these data provided by the manufacturer, determining the nitrate content ourselves would have been preferable. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation effects on physiological parameters during hypoxic exposure, while Deuterium is not directly mentioned or linked to nitrate. The study focuses on the impact of dietary nitrate on nitric oxide (NO) availability and its physiological effects, without any reference to Deuterium's role or relevance in this process. Thus, there is no established relationship between nitrate and Deuterium in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between nitrate and Deuterium, as Deuterium is not mentioned in a relevant context or linked to the effects of nitrate supplementation.",
