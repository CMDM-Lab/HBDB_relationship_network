    "context": "This explanation is not supported by results that found beetroot juice supplementation to improve endothelial function at 3700\u00a0m after 3 days of trekking from lower altitude. An alternative explanation is that dietary nitrate supplementation does not alter any of the specific variables we measured involved with hypoxic acclimatisation; heart rate, blood pressure, SpO2, and ventilation rate. This is supported somewhat by Casey et\u00a0al. who found no effect of nitrate supplementation on heart rate, blood pressure, and SPO2 during very acute (<10\u00a0min) normobaric hypoxic exposure.Limitations A significant limitation of this study was that, secondary to logistical constraints, we were not able to measure circulating NO metabolite concentrations. Accordingly, we are unable to confirm that the dietary nitrate supplementation regime was successful in enhancing NO availability. Previous studies using a similar protocol (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a070\u00a0ml/day of concentrated beetroot juice produced by the same manufacturer), did find ingestion to increase plasma nitrate and nitrite levels, however in these,; however in these, the final dose of beetroot juice was consumed 2.5\u00a0h before blood was taken and physiological variables were measured, potentially ensuring the acute effects of the supplementation were present. In our study, the second beetroot juice of the day was consumed in the evening, with measurements undertaken the following morning approximately twelve hours later. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation through beetroot juice and its potential effects on metabolites such as nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives (nitrate and nitrite). The study indicates that while previous research showed increased plasma levels of these metabolites following nitrate ingestion, the current study could not confirm this due to limitations in measuring circulating NO metabolites. Thus, the relationship between dietary nitrate and its metabolites is acknowledged but remains inconclusive in this specific study.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is directly linked to the production of metabolites like nitrite and nitric oxide. However, the study's limitations in measuring these metabolites prevent a stronger conclusion about their relationship.",
