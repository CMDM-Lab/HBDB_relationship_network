    "context": "[1] Cyanobacterial cells with functional NR reduce intracellular nitrate in the light and usually accumulate only low concentration of nitrate (20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 \u00ce\u00bcm) . [2] NC2 cells, however, accumulated nitrate under illumination to a concentration as high as 1 mm in the absence of ammonium (Fig. 6 C), although the intracellular nitrate was subsequently depleted presumably due to reduction by NR (Fig. 6 C). [3] Similar to NC4, NC2 accumulated nitrate in the presence of ammonium, showing no depletion of the intracellular nitrate (Fig. 6 C). [4] The maintenance of intracellular nitrate accumulation in NC2 cells in the presence of ammonium but not in its absence suggested inhibition by ammonium of NR activity, in accordance with the complete inhibition by ammonium of nitrate uptake in NC2 (Fig. 5 D). [1] In NC2, the uptake of nitrite from the medium proceeded in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the nitrate/nitrite transporter of NC2 is much less susceptible to ammonium than the wild-type transporter. [2] This, however, apparently contradicted with the complete inhibition by ammonium of nitrate uptake by the mutant (Fig. 5 D). [3] Direct measurements of intracellular nitrate concentration, performed by HPLC determination of nitrate in acid lysates of the cell , showed that NC2 and its NR-less derivative (NC4) accumulate high concentrations of nitrate intracellularly in the presence of ammonium (Figs. 6, B andC).

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically focusing on its accumulation and reduction within cyanobacterial cells. The study discusses how different strains of cyanobacteria manage intracellular nitrate levels under varying conditions, particularly in the presence or absence of ammonium, highlighting the biochemical processes involved in nitrate uptake and reduction. The terms are used interchangeably, emphasizing the significance of nitrate in cellular metabolism and its regulatory mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate', as they are the same compound discussed in detail regarding its biological functions and interactions within the context of cyanobacterial metabolism.",
