    "context": "[5] NrtC is unique among the ATP-binding subunits of the ABC transporters in that it consists of two distinct domains, one of which (amino acids 1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c254) is strongly similar to NrtD and the ATP-binding subunits of other ABC transporters, whereas the other (amino acids 279\u00e2\u20ac\u201c659) is 30% identical in amino acid sequence to NrtA . [6] In this work, we constructed and characterized deletion mutants of Synechococcus sp. [7] strain PCC 7942 lacking NrtC or with a truncated NrtC lacking the C-terminal domain. [8] Measurements of nitrate and nitrite uptake from medium and of intracellular nitrate accumulation and examination of the effects of ammonium thereon showed that NrtC is an essential component of the nitrate transporter and that the C-terminal domain of NrtC is involved in the ammonium-promoted inhibition of the transporter. [1] A derivative ofSynechococcus sp. [2] strain PCC 7942 that is cured of the resident small plasmid pUH24 (R2-SPc, Ref. ; hereafter designated simply as strain PCC 7942) and the mutant strains derived therefrom were grown photoautotrophically under CO2-sufficient conditions as described previously . [3] The growth temperature was 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C unless otherwise stated. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are related through the function of the NrtC protein, which is part of the nitrate transporter in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. The study indicates that ammonium promotes the inhibition of nitrate uptake, suggesting a regulatory relationship where ammonium levels can affect the transport and accumulation of nitrate within the cells. This interaction highlights the importance of ammonium in modulating nitrate transport processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and ammonium, as the context provides evidence of ammonium's role in inhibiting nitrate transport, indicating a clear functional relationship within the biological system studied.",
