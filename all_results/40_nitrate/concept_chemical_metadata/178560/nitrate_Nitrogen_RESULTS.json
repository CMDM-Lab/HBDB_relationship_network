    "context": "[1] Immunoblotting analysis of the products of the wild-type and the mutant nrtC genes.Ammonium-grown cells were transferred to nitrate-containing medium, and cytoplasmic membrane samples were extracted and purified from the cells before and 16 h after the transfer. [2] The membrane samples (10 \u00ce\u00bcg of protein/lane) from wild type (WT, lanes 1 and2) and NC2 (lanes 3 and 4) extracted before (lanes 1 and 3) and 16 h after (lanes 2 and 4) the transfer were electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. [3] After the electrophoresis, polypeptides in the gel were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunostaining using the antiserum against the NrtC polypeptide. [1] In a medium containing 2 mm nitrate as the nitrogen source, NC2 grew as rapidly as the wild-type strain, whereas NC3 grew only poorly (Fig. 4 A). [2] The cell suspensions of the wild-type strain and NC2 (5 \u00ce\u00bcg Chl/ml) used 120 \u00ce\u00bcm of nitrate until its exhaustion in 30 min, whereas the NC3 cells could not utilize the low concentration of nitrate (Fig.4 B). [3] These findings indicated that NC2 is capable of active transport of nitrate but NC3 is not. [4] A derivative of NC3 carrying plasmid-borne nrtC (designated NC31) utilized nitrate until its exhaustion (Fig. 4 B), indicating that NrtC itself is essential for nitrate transport. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a nitrogen source for the growth of certain bacterial strains. The study highlights the ability of the wild-type strain and NC2 to utilize nitrate effectively, indicating that nitrate serves as a critical form of nitrogen for cellular metabolism. The relationship emphasizes the role of nitrate in nitrogen assimilation processes in bacteria, linking it directly to nitrogen's biological significance.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrogen, as nitrate is explicitly identified as a nitrogen source essential for bacterial growth. The context provides evidence of nitrate's role in nitrogen transport and utilization, underscoring its importance in nitrogen metabolism.",
