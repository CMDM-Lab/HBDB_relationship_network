    "context": "[1] The molecular mechanism of the regulation of the nitrate/nitrite transporting activity by the C-terminal domain of NrtC remains to be elucidated. [2] In Synechococcus sp. [3] strain PCC 6301, a plasma membrane protein kinase activity has been shown to be rapidly inactivated, whereas a soluble phosphatase activity is activated, after exposure of the cells to ammonium . [4] Because the ammonium-sensitive protein kinase activity has been shown to phosphorylate several cytoplasmic membrane proteins including those comigrating with NrtA and NrtD , the regulation of nitrate transport may involve phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the transporter. [5] The C-terminal domain of NrtC may act as a sensor of the dephosphorylation cascade triggered by ammonium or may interact specifically with the other parts of the dephosphorylated transporter to inhibit the transport. [6] On the other hand, the similarity of the C-terminal domain of NrtC in amino acid sequence to NrtA , which has been shown to be a nitrate/nitrite-binding protein , suggests that the C-terminal domain of NrtC may be an effector-binding domain. [7] Because the maltose transporter of E. coli is inhibited by a proteinaceous effector binding to the C-terminal extension of its ATP-binding subunit , the regulation of the cyanobacterial nitrate transporter might also involve a proteinaceous effector.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are connected through their roles in the regulation of nitrate transport in Synechococcus sp. The presence of ammonium activates a soluble phosphatase and inactivates a protein kinase, which may influence the phosphorylation state of nitrate transporters like NrtC. This suggests that ammonium plays a regulatory role in nitrate transport mechanisms, potentially affecting how nitrate is taken up by the cells.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and ammonium, as the context discusses how ammonium influences the regulation of nitrate transport through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes, indicating a clear functional relationship.",
