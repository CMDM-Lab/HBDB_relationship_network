    "context": "[2] Nitrate transport activity was induced by transfer of the ammonium-grown cells to nitrite-containing medium followed by incubation under the growth conditions for 15 h. [3] Accumulation of intracellular nitrate was measured at 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C in the light in the presence of 20 \u00ce\u00bcm KNO3 and 10 mm NaHCO3, using the silicone oil filtering centrifugation technique and HPLC determination of nitrate as described previously . [1] NR and NiR activities were determined at 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C, using toluene-permeabilized cells with dithionite-reduced methylviologen as the electron donor . [2] Nitrate and nitrite were determined with a flow injection analyzer (NOX-1000W, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.). [3] Ammonium was determined as described by Anderson and Little . [4] Chlorophyll and protein were determined according to Mackinney  and Lowry et al. , respectively. [1] In Southern hybridization analysis of the BamHI-XbaI digest of genomic DNA from the wild-type strain, the nrtB-specific probe hybridized with a 3.0-kbp DNA fragment (Fig.1 B, lane 1), which was recognized also by the probes specific to the 5\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 portion (Fig.1 B, lane 4) and the 3\u00e2\u20ac\u00b2 portion (Fig.1 B, lane 7) of nrtC, as expected from the restriction map of the nirA operon (Fig. 1 A).

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, with the text discussing its transport activity and measurement in various experimental conditions. The context emphasizes the biochemical processes involving nitrate, including its accumulation and determination in biological samples. However, there is no distinction or additional information provided that differentiates the two terms, as they are used interchangeably.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship because 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are simply different representations of the same compound without any additional context or functional relationship discussed between them.",
