    "context": "[2] On the morning of each study visit, the patient did not use any medications or complete chest therapy, and he consumed an identical, low nitrate breakfast that was confirmed by a review with a dietitian (CPK). [3] On both days, in an identical manner and at the same time, FeNO (NiOx MINO; Aerocrine, Sweden) and pulmonary function were assessed before and 1.5 hours after the study beverage. [4] We added water and blackcurrant cordial (sugar- and nitrate-free) to the juice in an identical manner on both days to make it more palatable at the request of the patient. [5] The 1.5 hour delay between baseline and post-beverage testing was to facilitate in-vivo reduction of dietary nitrate to NO. [6] During this delay, the patient rested quietly in a clinic room and did not exercise, eat, drink, or take medication. [1] There was no effect on pulmonary function after either beverage. [2] However, 1.5 hours following BRJ, FeNO increased by 150% (30 ppb) but decreased by 17% after PL (\u00e2\u02c6\u20194 ppb) (Figure 1 and Table 3). ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically in relation to dietary intake and its effects on pulmonary function and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels. The study examines the impact of a low nitrate breakfast on the reduction of dietary nitrate to nitric oxide (NO) in vivo, highlighting the physiological relevance of nitrate in respiratory health. However, the terms are used interchangeably without distinct differentiation in their roles or effects.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as both terms refer to the same compound but do not provide detailed insights into their specific interactions or distinct roles within the context. They are mentioned in relation to dietary effects but lack a deeper exploration of their relationship.",
