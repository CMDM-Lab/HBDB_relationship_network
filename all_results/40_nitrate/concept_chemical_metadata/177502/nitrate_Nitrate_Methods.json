    "context": "Patients randomly assigned to PTCA were scheduled to undergo an intervention within three months, and this was achieved in 93%. The intended strategy was based on conventional balloon dilation, but stents were permissible if the initial angioplasty result was unsatisfactory. Patients assigned to medical treatment were prescribed antianginal medication for symptom relief, with a later myocardial revascularization procedure reserved for patients whose symptoms were not adequately controlled by optimal medical therapy. This usually included a beta-adrenergic blocker, a calcium antagonist or a long-acting nitrate in maximally tolerated doses, or a combination of these. All patients in both groups were treated with aspirin unless contraindicated. Patients were assessed at baseline and at three months, six months and yearly after randomization. Angina was assessed with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society\u2019s classification (2) and by documentation of antianginal drug use. ",

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' refers to a class of medications, specifically long-acting nitrates, used for symptom relief in patients undergoing treatment for angina. The mention of nitrates indicates their role in managing cardiovascular conditions, particularly in conjunction with other antianginal medications. However, there is no distinct discussion differentiating between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' as separate entities, suggesting they are used interchangeably in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' are mentioned in the context of antianginal treatment but lack a detailed discussion of their specific relationship or differences.",
