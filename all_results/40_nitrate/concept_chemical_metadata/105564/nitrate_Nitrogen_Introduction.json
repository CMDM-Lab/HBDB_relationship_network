    "context": "The PVA/peat composite bead containing phosphorus and available nitrogen nutrients would be an innovative filter material. Such filter materials have not previously been reported in the relevant literature. This article reports a process to prepare a spherical PVA/peat composite bead containing phosphorus and available nitrogen nutrients. Inorganic nitrogen as potassium nitrate (KNO3) is used as the available nitrogen nutrient. The mechanism of water-soluble nitrogen dissolving out of the composite beads and the variation of VOCs removal efficiency during the biofilter operation is also recorded. The VOCs is ethyl acetate. Materials Industrial grade peat was dried at 105\u00b0C before use. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned as a source of available nitrogen nutrients in the preparation of a PVA/peat composite bead. Potassium nitrate (KNO3) serves as the inorganic nitrogen source, indicating that nitrate is a form of nitrogen that can be utilized in the biofilter material. The relationship highlights the role of nitrate in providing essential nitrogen for biological processes, particularly in the context of enhancing VOC removal efficiency.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrogen, as nitrate is explicitly identified as a source of nitrogen in the composite bead. This relationship is supported by the context discussing its role in nutrient availability for biological processes.",
        "score": 4
