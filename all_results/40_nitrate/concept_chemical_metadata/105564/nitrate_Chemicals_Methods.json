    "context": "The mechanism of water-soluble nitrogen dissolving out of the composite beads and the variation of VOCs removal efficiency during the biofilter operation is also recorded. The VOCs is ethyl acetate. Materials Industrial grade peat was dried at 105\u00b0C before use. Boric acid, sodium monobasic phosphate, sodium dibasic phosphate, potassium nitrate and ethyl acetate (extra pure grade from Union Chemical Co., Hsinchu, Taiwan) were used as received. Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) powder (industrial grade from Chung Chun Petrochemical Co. Ltd., Hsinchu, Taiwan), pig manure compost (industrial grade from Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Chu-nan, Taiwan) and fern chips (industrial grade from Pao Shan Co., Hsinchu, Taiwan) were also obtained.Preparation procedures of composite bead Peat (l0g), sieved between 16 and 35 mesh (average diameter, 0.85mm), was added into an aqueous solution (40ml water mixed with the desired amount of KNO3) in a 100ml beaker, the mixture was sealed with parafilm and kept for approximately 24h for peat to adsorb KNO3 and water and reach equilibrium. PVA powder (l0g) in an aqueous solution (100ml water mixed with the desired amount of KNO3) was heated to 90\u00b0C for dissolution. Once the PVA powder was completely dissolved, the peat/KNO3 mixture was slowly added into the PVA/KNO3 mixture at 90\u00b0C. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned as one of the chemicals used in the preparation of composite beads for a biofilter system. It is included among other chemicals like boric acid and ethyl acetate, indicating its role as a component in the mixture. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific interactions or functions beyond being listed as a chemical used in the process.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as nitrate is simply listed among other chemicals without any detailed discussion of its specific role or interaction within the context. The relationship is more about its inclusion in a chemical mixture rather than a significant functional connection.",
