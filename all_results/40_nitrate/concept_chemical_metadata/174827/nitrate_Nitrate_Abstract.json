    "context": "[13] Although immobilization, plant uptake, and other losses may reduce nitrogen availability over time, these findings suggest that some effects may be long-lasting. [1] Cicada litterfall increases indices of soil nitrate and ammonium availability in forest soils. [2] (A) Soil ammonium availability under experimentally controlled cicada litterfall densities in the first 30 days and (B) in days 31 to 100. [3] (C) Soil nitrate availability under experimentally controlled cicada litterfall densities in the first 30 days and (D) in days 31 to 100. [4] Fitted lines represent least-squares polynomial regressions. [1] A third field experiment investigated the effects of belowground enrichment from cicada litterfall on growth and reproduction in a forest plant, the American bellflower (Campanulastrum americanum). [2] This herbaceous annual/biennial forest understory species is native throughout much of the geographic range of periodical cicadas, and previous studies with this species have suggested that the maternal nutrient environment can contribute to larger seed size , which influences germination  and seedling performance .

        "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, emphasizing its role in soil nutrient availability, particularly in relation to cicada litterfall. The study highlights how cicada litterfall affects soil nitrate levels over time, indicating its significance in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. The mention of both terms underscores their relevance in the context of soil chemistry and plant growth.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and critical relationship between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate', as they are the same compound discussed in the context of soil nutrient dynamics and plant growth, demonstrating their essential role in ecological processes.",
