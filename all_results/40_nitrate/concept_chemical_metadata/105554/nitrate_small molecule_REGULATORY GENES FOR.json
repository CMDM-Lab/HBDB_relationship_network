    "context": "[2] NIT2 has an RWP-RK motif within a leucine zipper and shows conservation with putative transcription coactivators from plants as nodule inception (NIN) proteins and the minus dominance (MID) protein of Chlamydomonas . [3] In addition, NIT2 shows a GAF domain at the N-terminal fragment of the protein, which is unable to bind specifically to DNA (Fig. 2A). [4] Glutamine-rich domains essential for NIT2 functionality are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions . [5] The GAF domain is known to bind small molecules such as oxoglutarate, nitric oxide, or cGMP ; however, nitrate was found not to bind to this domain . [6] A nuclear export sequence (Fig. 2A) was found in NIT2 that binds specifically to the NIA1 promoter regions previously identified as essential for a regulated expression of this gene .  [1] In an effort to identify regulatory genes for nitrate assimilation, a functional genomics approach was used with Chlamydomonas.  [2] To this purpose, an ordered mutant library of about 22,000 insertional mutant strains covering most of the genome was obtained . ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned in relation to the GAF domain of the NIT2 protein, which is known to bind small molecules like oxoglutarate and nitric oxide. However, it is specifically noted that nitrate does not bind to this domain, indicating a lack of interaction between nitrate and the small molecules typically associated with this protein. This suggests that while nitrate is a small molecule, it does not participate in the same binding interactions as others within this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as nitrate is categorized as a small molecule but is explicitly stated not to bind to the GAF domain, indicating a lack of direct relevance in terms of functional interaction.",
        "score": 2
