Although the numbers were small and there was little power to detect interactions, no clear pattern emerged suggesting an interaction effect between the beetroot juice intervention and altitude is unlikely. Main findings The principle finding of the present study is that nitrate supplementation does not increase or reduce symptoms of AMS, or alter key physiological variables, in a group of adolescent males during ascent to high altitude. Whilst it is apparent that NO plays an important role in the body's response to hypoxia, and numerous studies demonstrated the effects of nitrate supplementation on physiological function, both at SL and in acute normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia [11\u201313,15,22], our study questions that these effects persist following a more sustained exposure to hypoxia at altitude. We found beetroot juice supplementation, ingested twice daily at moderate to high altitude, had no significant effect on the prevalence of AMS, nor did it significantly affect resting and exercising SpO2, heart rate, and ventilation rate, and resting blood pressure. Although the sample size was relatively small and the confidence intervals were wide, the point estimates were all close to zero. However, it is possible that this result is a false negative (type 2 error). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation effects on physiological functions during high altitude exposure. The study found that nitrate supplementation, specifically through beetroot juice, did not significantly alter symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) or key physiological variables such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. This suggests that while nitrate is known to influence physiological functions, its effects may not be evident under sustained hypoxic conditions at altitude.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is linked to physiological function through its role in nitric oxide production and its known effects in various studies. However, the specific findings of this study indicate that these effects may not persist under certain conditions, limiting the strength of the relationship.",
