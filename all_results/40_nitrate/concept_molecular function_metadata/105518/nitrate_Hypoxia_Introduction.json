    "context": "Upon acute normobaric hypoxic exposure, nitrate supplementation has also been shown to: increase both peripheral and muscle oxygen saturations during rest and exercise, and improve exercise muscle energetics and performance [11\u201313]. Conversely, during more sustained hypoxic exposure (a six week normobaric hypoxic training regime), exercise performance was not altered by nitrate supplementation. The only study describing the effects of oral nitrate supplementation on physiological responses to high altitude exposure found a single beetroot juice drink (5\u00a0mmol) restored endothelial function to pre-trek levels following 3 days of trekking from 1523 to 3700\u00a0m. These studies demonstrate that nitrate supplementation can effectively alter physiological responses to acute normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia. To the authors' knowledge, no literature exists describing the effects of sustained oral nitrate supplementation on the physiological responses to prolonged high altitude exposure, a situation experienced by millions of residents and tourists each year. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the effect of oral nitrate supplementation, in the form of beetroot juice, on basic physiological responses and acute mountain sickness symptoms, in a group of young teenaged males trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp (EBC). Study design The study consisted of a single-blind (participants) parallel group randomised controlled trial, wherein a nitrate supplemented group (n\u00a0=\u00a021), and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a019), ascended from Kathmandu (KTM) to EBC over eleven days.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate supplementation is investigated for its effects on physiological responses to hypoxia, particularly during acute normobaric hypoxic exposure. The studies indicate that nitrate can enhance oxygen saturation and improve exercise performance under hypoxic conditions. However, its efficacy appears limited during prolonged hypoxic exposure, suggesting a nuanced relationship where nitrate may be beneficial in acute scenarios but not in sustained hypoxia.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and hypoxia, as the context provides evidence of nitrate's role in improving physiological responses to acute hypoxic conditions. However, the lack of effect during sustained hypoxia prevents a higher score.",
