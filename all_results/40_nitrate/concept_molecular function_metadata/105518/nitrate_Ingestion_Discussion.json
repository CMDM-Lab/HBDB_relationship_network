    "context": "There were also a number of missing data points due to individuals not completing parts of the assessment at various locations and not drinking the juice when required. Finally, given the wide confidence intervals that were noticed in all models tested we cannot exclude values that are consistent with a difference being present between the groups. As such, a larger sample size is required to obtain definitive results about the effect of beetroot juice supplementation on the variables measured.Conclusion This study found that twice daily supplementation of dietary nitrate (via beetroot juice ingestion) does not reduce or increase the prevalence of symptoms of AMS or alter key physiological variables, in a group of adolescent males during a high altitude trekking expedition when compared to a control group receiving no nitrate supplementation. The study demonstrated that dietary nitrate supplementation at altitude is both feasible and safe. The study was however limited by both its modest sample size and lack of measurement of circulating NO metabolite concentrations. In view of the important role of NO in the physiological response to hypoxia, and given the limitations of this study, these findings should be considered preliminary, and further, adequately powered studies into the efficacy of dietary nitrate supplementation for improving tolerance to high altitude hypoxia are feasible and may be justified.

        "summary": "In this context, dietary nitrate is linked to ingestion through the supplementation of beetroot juice, which is a source of nitrate. The study investigates the effects of this nitrate ingestion on symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and physiological variables during high altitude trekking. While the study concludes that nitrate supplementation does not significantly alter AMS symptoms or key physiological variables, it emphasizes the feasibility and safety of nitrate ingestion at altitude, suggesting a need for further research on its potential benefits.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and ingestion, as the study focuses on dietary nitrate obtained through beetroot juice ingestion. The context provides evidence of the relationship, although the effects observed were not statistically significant.",
