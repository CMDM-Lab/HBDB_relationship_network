    "context": "Additionally, reduced NO bioavailability is associated with increased pulmonary artery systolic pressures at high altitude, and inhalation of NO gas (15\u00a0ppm) was seen to reduce pulmonary artery pressures in patients suffering from high altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE). A large proportion of NO is produced by the oxygen (O2) dependent oxidation of L-arginine. This so called \u2018L-arginine-NO pathway\u2019, involves various isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. In recent years however, it has become apparent that a complementary L-arginine-independent system might also contribute to NO production through the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite to NO. Nitrate is particularly abundant in foods such as beetroot and spinach, and following oral consumption, plasma nitrate levels are seen to increase and profound effects have been demonstrated on a wide range of human physiological responses including; lowering arterial blood pressure, lowering resting metabolic rate, and improving exercise performance. Upon acute normobaric hypoxic exposure, nitrate supplementation has also been shown to: increase both peripheral and muscle oxygen saturations during rest and exercise, and improve exercise muscle energetics and performance [11\u201313]. Conversely, during more sustained hypoxic exposure (a six week normobaric hypoxic training regime), exercise performance was not altered by nitrate supplementation. The only study describing the effects of oral nitrate supplementation on physiological responses to high altitude exposure found a single beetroot juice drink (5\u00a0mmol) restored endothelial function to pre-trek levels following 3 days of trekking from 1523 to 3700\u00a0m.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to metabolic rates through its role in enhancing nitric oxide (NO) production, which has various physiological effects, including lowering resting metabolic rate and improving exercise performance. Nitrate supplementation has been shown to increase oxygen saturation and enhance muscle energetics during exercise, indicating a significant impact on metabolic responses. However, the effects on metabolic rates may vary with the duration of hypoxic exposure, suggesting a complex relationship between nitrate intake and metabolic function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and metabolic rates, supported by evidence of physiological responses to nitrate supplementation, including effects on resting metabolic rate and exercise performance. However, the variability in response during sustained hypoxic exposure prevents a higher score.",
