    "context": "[2] Activation of neutrophils is thought to contribute to the toxicity caused by these two cytokines. [3] We studied the effect of IL-1 in vivo on changes in neutrophil numbers and neutrophil degranulation as well as on the formation of neutrophil agonists, such as complement activation products, and on levels of TNF, IL-6, IL-8, and nitrite/nitrate (as a measure of nitric oxide production). [4] Six patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with 3 ng/kg recombinant human IL-1 beta daily. [5] One hour after the start of the 30-min IL-1 infusion, which caused mild cardiovascular toxicity, plasma levels of IL-6 reached a peak of 25 +/- 9 ng/L (mean +/- SEM), IL-8 reached a peak of 311 +/- 100 ng/L at 2 h, and nitrite/nitrate peaked after 10 h to 89 +/- 27 mumol/L. [6] IL-1 did not induce significant changes in plasma levels of TNF or of the complement activation products C3a and C4b/c. [7] Although IL-1 induced neutrophilia, levels of elastase and lactoferrin did not change. [8] The failure of IL-1 to degranulate neutrophils was confirmed in an ex vivo model with whole blood culture in which doses of up to 100 microgram/L IL-1 beta or IL-1 alpha failed to induce significant elastase or lactoferrin release, whereas TNF, tested as a positive control, was able to do so.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned as a measure of nitric oxide production, which is relevant to the inflammatory response mediated by interleukin-1 (IL-1). The study investigates the effects of IL-1 on neutrophil activation and cytokine levels, including interleukin-8 (IL-8). While nitrate levels are measured, there is no direct discussion of interleukin-8 receptor binding activity or its relationship with nitrate, indicating a more indirect connection through the inflammatory process rather than a direct interaction.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection between nitrate and interleukin-8 receptor binding activity, as both are involved in the inflammatory response but lack a detailed discussion of their direct relationship in the context provided.",
