    "context": "[2] DNA-DGGE was therefore not sufficiently sensitive to detect differences in the activities of N. briensis and En13. [3] Incorporation of [13C]CO2 was detected at all initial ammonia concentrations before detectable changes in nitrite/nitrate production. [4] At low and intermediate initial ammonia concentrations, [13C]CO2 incorporation was detected 5 days before detectable nitrite/nitrate production, while at high initial ammonia concentrations it was detected 10 days prior to detectable nitrite/nitrate increases. [5] In general, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-DGGE profiles obtained at later time points (10 or 20 days) were similar to the 13C-labeled DNA-SIP-DGGE profiles and also allowed detection of changes in relative activities before DNA-DGGE and before detectable nitrite/nitrate production. [1] Interactions between one ammonia-tolerant strain and two ammonia-sensitive strains (community B).Community B contained one ammonia-tolerant, fast-growing strain, Nitrosospira EnU4a, and two ammonia-sensitive Nitrosospira strains, 40KI and L115. [2] Growth in monoculture suggested that EnU4a would dominate, even at low and intermediate ammonia. [3] Growth of the mixed culture occurred at all initial ammonia concentrations but with a lag phase of at least 20 days at high ammonia (Fig. 3a). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and reverse transcription are mentioned in relation to the detection of changes in microbial activity and metabolic processes. While reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is utilized to analyze DNA profiles and track changes in relative activities, nitrate is indirectly involved as a product of microbial metabolism. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship established between nitrate and reverse transcription in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as both terms are part of the broader study of microbial activity and metabolic processes, but their relationship is not explicitly detailed or significant.",
