    "context": " [7] Further, the patient had no other medical history of note, including no asthma or allergy (which could influence FeNO measurement).  [8] He generally requires antibiotics every 8\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 weeks, but had no recent infection or antibiotic use and no evidence of concurrent bacterial colonization.  [9] Further, his medication regimen was stable and typical for a patient with CF (Table 2). [10] We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design to assess the acute impact of dietary nitrate as 140 ml beetroot juice (BRJ, 12.9 mmol nitrate) or 140 ml matched, nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (PL, < 0.5mmol) on exhaled NO. [11] This nitrate dose is obtainable with a diet rich in vegetables. [1] We conducted two clinic visits 14 days apart, where there were no relevant changes in factors known to influence NO (including diet, exercise, and medication habits). [2] On the morning of each study visit, the patient did not use any medications or complete chest therapy, and he consumed an identical, low nitrate breakfast that was confirmed by a review with a dietitian (CPK).

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is investigated for its acute impact on exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels in patients with cystic fibrosis. The study compares the effects of dietary nitrate from beetroot juice against a nitrate-depleted placebo on exhalation of NO. This suggests a direct relationship where dietary nitrate influences the exhalation of NO, a marker of airway inflammation and respiratory function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and exhalation, as the study provides evidence of dietary nitrate affecting exhaled NO levels, indicating its relevance in respiratory physiology. However, the relationship is primarily focused on NO rather than a broader context of exhalation.",
