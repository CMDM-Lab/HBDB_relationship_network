    "context": "[2] Mutants from the Chlamydomonas mutant collection were found to be defective at genomic regions bearing putative genes that could be related to nitrate assimilation regulation. [3] These are related to regulatory functions such as peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, DNA binding, guanylate cyclase, or protein kinase . [4] Generated data are consistent with a complex network mediating negative signaling of nitrate assimilation. [1] From the data discussed above, it can be concluded that Chlamydomonas is an attractive system for unraveling fundamental points of nitrate assimilation such as genes and functions for transporters at the plasma and plastid membranes and for positive and negative regulatory networks of the pathway in photosynthetic eukaryotes. [2] Though valuable new information has recently been generated from this pathway, much more data are needed to get a better understanding of the regulatory and metabolic circuits involved.
