    "context": "[6] Levels of TNF\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 in the brain were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and results are reported as picograms of cytokine per milligram of protein present in the brain homogenate. [7] The limit of detection for both TNF\u00ce\u00b1 and IL-1\u00ce\u00b2 cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was 5 pg ml-1. [1] Nitrite Measurement. [2] The total amount of NO in plasma was indirectly determined by measuring total nitrites and nitrates (end products of NO oxidation) using a NO assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [3] The kit involved converting nitrates into nitrites and then measuring the converted products using Griess reagent. [4] Nitrite accumulation was determined in a 96-well plate format with the absorbances read at 540 nm. [5] The limit of detection for this assay was 2.5 \u00ce\u00bcM. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a product of nitric oxide (NO) oxidation, where total nitrites and nitrates are measured as end products. The methodology involves converting nitrates into nitrites for quantification, indicating a direct relationship between nitrate levels and the oxidation process of NO. This highlights the role of nitrates in the biochemical pathway of NO metabolism and its implications in physiological processes.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and oxidation, as the context describes the measurement of nitrates as end products of NO oxidation, supported by specific assay methods. This indicates a clear biochemical relationship within the context of metabolism.",
        "score": 4
