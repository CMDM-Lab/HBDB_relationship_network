    "context": "There was also no correlation between the magnitude of the change in breath NO and the magnitude of the change in muscle speed and/or power. It is possible, however, that the magnitude of the changes in breath NO was not directly reflective of the magnitude of changes/lack-of-changes in NO (or more importantly/directly, cGMP) within muscle itself. Since the biological effects of NO are most prominent in fast-twitch, or type II, muscle fibers, another possibility is that these three subjects had a low percentage of this fiber type, and thus responded less/not at all to dietary NO3 \u2212 supplementation. Additional studies will be required to determine why NO3 \u2212 intake does not alter muscle contractile properties in all individuals, perhaps by examining genetic differences in endogenous NO production. As in previous studies (e.g.,), the subjects in the present investigation were studied after a short (i.e., 7\u2009d) period of controlled dietary NO3 \u2212 intake. This intervention was apparently successful in minimizing the potentially confounding effect of day-to-day variations in NO bioavailability, as indicated by a high correlation (i.e., R2\u2009=\u20090.87; P\u2009<\u20090.001) in individual baseline breath NO levels between the placebo and NO3 \u2212 trials. While in theory this diet may have led to a reduction in NO3 \u2212 to below-normal levels, Jungersten et\u00a0al. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3\u2212) supplementation is investigated for its potential effects on muscle properties, specifically muscle speed and power. However, the study found no correlation between changes in breath nitric oxide (NO) levels and muscle contractile properties. It suggests that individual differences, such as muscle fiber composition, may influence the response to dietary nitrate, indicating that not all individuals benefit from nitrate supplementation in terms of muscle performance.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is linked to muscle properties through its role in nitric oxide production, but the lack of observed effects on muscle speed and power indicates that the relationship is not straightforward and may vary among individuals.",
