    "context": "Specifically, percutaneous electrical stimulation of a motor nerve inverts the normal orderly recruitment of motor units, preferentially depolarizing larger alpha motor neurons innervating type II muscle fibers (cf. Ref. for review). As indicated above, at least in animals the effects of NO on muscle are greatest in such fibers; thus, electrical stimulation as used by Haider and Folland might favor finding a positive effect. In contrast, during a voluntary isometric contraction both slow-twitch, or type I, as well as type II fibers would be recruited, thus potentially \u201cdiluting\u201d the effects of NO produced via the NO3 \u2212 \u2192 NO2 \u2212 \u2192 NO pathway. A greater impact of NO3 \u2212-derived NO in type II vs. type I fibers would also explain why in the present study dietary NO3 \u2212 intake only improved muscle function at the highest angular velocity tested, since under these conditions the relative contribution of type II fibers to force/torque development would be greatest [38\u201340]. There are several limitations to the present study. We did not measure changes in plasma NO3 \u2212 or NO2 \u2212, and therefore cannot determine whether interindividual differences in NO3 \u2212 absorption and/or reduction to NO2 \u2212 accounted for the lack of improvement in muscle function in some subjects.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its conversion to nitric oxide (NO) and its effects on muscle fibers during isometric contraction. The study suggests that dietary nitrate intake may enhance muscle function, particularly in type II muscle fibers, during high angular velocity contractions. However, during voluntary isometric contractions, the recruitment of both type I and type II fibers may dilute the effects of NO, indicating that the benefits of nitrate may be more pronounced under specific conditions that favor type II fiber recruitment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and isometric contraction, as the context discusses how nitrate-derived NO influences muscle function, particularly in type II fibers during specific contraction conditions. The evidence suggests a clear relationship, although some limitations in measurement were noted.",
        "score": 4
