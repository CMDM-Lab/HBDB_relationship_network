    "context": "Additional breath NO measurements were made 60 and 120\u2009min after BRJ ingestion, after which the subject performed a 6\u00a0min walk test in a hallway of the CRU. This test (data to be reported separately) was included to assess the effects of acute dietary NO3 \u2212 intake on aerobic exercise performance and also to serve as a warm-up for the subsequent muscle function testing (see below). Approximately 10\u2009min after completion of the muscle function testing, breath NO was measured for a final time, after which the subject was fed lunch then released from the CRU. The timing of all measurements was based on previous studies demonstrating that plasma NO3 \u2212 levels and breath NO concentrations peak approximately 2\u00a0h after dietary NO3 \u2212 intake.Measurement of skeletal muscle contractile function A Biodex 4 isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) was used to measure each subject's maximal voluntary force (torque) production and hence power during knee extension exercise performed with their dominant leg at angular velocities of (in order) 0, 1.57, 3.14, 4.71, and 6.28\u2009rad/s (0, 90, 180, 270, and 360\u00b0/s). These velocities were specifically chosen to approximately span the ascending limb of the power\u2013velocity relationship, thus aiding accurate calculation of maximal speed and power (see below) while minimizing errors due to the influence of acceleration, impact torque, etc. The chair back\u2013chair seat angle was set to 85\u00b0 and the dynamometer adjusted to place the axis of rotation of the lever arm adjacent to the lateral femoral epicondyle. To minimize extraneous movement, straps were placed across the torso, hips, and thigh, and subjects were not allowed to use the handholds. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the assessment of muscle function, specifically through the measurement of torque production during knee extension exercises. The study investigates how dietary nitrate intake affects aerobic exercise performance and muscle contractile function, with torque being a key metric for evaluating muscle strength and power output. However, the direct relationship between nitrate and torque is not explicitly detailed, focusing instead on the broader context of exercise performance.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is involved in the context of muscle function testing where torque is measured. While they are related through the study's focus on exercise performance, the specific interaction between nitrate intake and torque production is not deeply explored.",
