    "context": "To minimize extraneous movement, straps were placed across the torso, hips, and thigh, and subjects were not allowed to use the handholds. After determining the range of motion, the subject performed 3\u20134 knee extensions at each velocity, with the isometric testing being conducted at a knee angle of 1.22\u2009rad (70\u00b0). Two minutes of rest was allowed after each group of contractions. Subsequently, the subject performed a 50 contraction fatigue test (at 3.14\u2009rad/s) to determine whether dietary NO3 \u2212 influences fatigue resistance during repetitive, maximal activation. Subjects were explicitly instructed to go \u201call out\u201d (i.e., to not pace themselves) during this test, and strong verbal encouragement was provided throughout all portions of the isokinetic testing.Data analyses To eliminate artifacts, the isokinetic dynamometer data were windowed to isolate the isokinetic phase, filtered using a nine point weighted moving average, then smoothed as previously described. The highest torque generated at each velocity was multiplied by the velocity to determine the peak power at that velocity. The resulting power\u2013velocity data were then fit with a 2nd order polynomial function (i.e., y\u2009=\u2009ax2\u2009+\u2009bx\u2009+\u2009c) that was solved to determine the subject's maximal knee extensor velocity (Vmax; =\u2212b/a) and power (Pmax; =(4ac\u2009\u2212\u2009b2)/4a) as described by Yamauchi et\u00a0al.. Data from a representative subject are shown in Fig.\u20091 . ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3\u2212) is investigated for its potential influence on muscle contraction and fatigue resistance during a series of knee extension exercises. The study aims to determine whether dietary nitrate affects the ability to sustain maximal contractions over time, suggesting a relationship between nitrate intake and muscle performance during repetitive contractions. However, the specific mechanisms by which nitrate may enhance contraction or fatigue resistance are not detailed in the provided context.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is linked to muscle contraction through its potential effects on fatigue resistance during exercise. However, the context does not provide detailed evidence or mechanisms of this relationship.",
