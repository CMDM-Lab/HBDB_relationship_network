    "context": "The subject then ingested 140\u2009mL of a commercial BRJ supplement (Beet It Sport\u00ae, James White Drinks, Ipswich, UK) either containing or essentially devoid of 11.2\u2009mmol of NO3 \u2212. The placebo, which is prepared by James White Drinks by extracting NO3 \u2212 from BRJ using an ion exchange resin, is indistinguishable in packaging, color, taste, texture, and smell from the standard product, and does not alter plasma NO3 \u2212/NO2 \u2212 concentrations or breath NO levels (see Results). Additional breath NO measurements were made 60 and 120\u2009min after BRJ ingestion, after which the subject performed a 6\u00a0min walk test in a hallway of the CRU. This test (data to be reported separately) was included to assess the effects of acute dietary NO3 \u2212 intake on aerobic exercise performance and also to serve as a warm-up for the subsequent muscle function testing (see below). Approximately 10\u2009min after completion of the muscle function testing, breath NO was measured for a final time, after which the subject was fed lunch then released from the CRU. The timing of all measurements was based on previous studies demonstrating that plasma NO3 \u2212 levels and breath NO concentrations peak approximately 2\u00a0h after dietary NO3 \u2212 intake.Measurement of skeletal muscle contractile function A Biodex 4 isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY) was used to measure each subject's maximal voluntary force (torque) production and hence power during knee extension exercise performed with their dominant leg at angular velocities of (in order) 0, 1.57, 3.14, 4.71, and 6.28\u2009rad/s (0, 90, 180, 270, and 360\u00b0/s). These velocities were specifically chosen to approximately span the ascending limb of the power\u2013velocity relationship, thus aiding accurate calculation of maximal speed and power (see below) while minimizing errors due to the influence of acceleration, impact torque, etc. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to muscle function through its role in enhancing aerobic exercise performance. The study investigates the effects of dietary nitrate intake from a beetroot juice supplement on muscle contractile function during a knee extension exercise test. Measurements of breath nitric oxide (NO) and muscle power output are taken to assess the impact of nitrate on muscle performance, indicating a potential beneficial effect of nitrate on muscle function during exercise.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and muscle function, supported by the study's design to measure the effects of dietary nitrate on muscle performance. The context provides evidence of nitrate's role in enhancing exercise capacity, although specific quantitative results are not detailed.",
