    "context": "increased NO bioavailability, as indicated by the amount of NO in breath (Fig.\u20092 ). There was no significant difference in maximal isometric torque (2.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\u2009Nm/kg NO3 \u2212 vs. 2.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13\u2009Nm/kg placebo; P\u2009=\u20090.61; ES\u2009=\u2009\u22120.15) or in peak isokinetic torque or power at 1.57\u20134.17 rad/s (Table\u20091 ; ES\u2009=\u2009\u22120.21 to 0.15). However, a significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) trial-by-velocity interaction effect existed for peak torque, as dietary NO3 \u2212 tended (P\u2009=\u20090.12; ES\u2009=\u20090.74) to increase peak torque at the highest angular velocity tested, i.e., at 6.28\u2009rad/s. This difference at 6.28\u2009rad/s was significant when data were expressed as a percentage of maximal isometric torque (P\u2009<\u20090.01; ES\u2009=\u20090.59), or as power instead of torque (P\u2009<\u20090.01; ES\u2009=\u20090.74). Vmax was therefore higher (P\u2009<\u20090.05; ES\u2009=\u20090.67) in the NO3 \u2212 trial (Fig.\u20093 , top panel), as was Pmax (P\u2009<\u20090.05; ES\u2009=\u20090.63) (Fig.\u20093, bottom panel). Nine of the subjects exhibited an increase in Vmax of, on average, 16\u2009\u00b1\u20095%, whereas in the other three subjects Vmax was essentially unaltered (i.e., \u22121\u2009\u00b1\u20091%). ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to torque through its role in enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, which may influence muscle performance. The study indicates that while there was no significant difference in maximal isometric torque between nitrate and placebo, a tendency for increased peak torque at higher angular velocities was observed with dietary nitrate supplementation. This suggests a potential positive effect of nitrate on muscle torque under specific conditions, particularly at higher velocities.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate's impact on torque is discussed with some evidence of interaction, particularly at higher velocities, but the overall relationship lacks strong quantitative support across all measures.",
