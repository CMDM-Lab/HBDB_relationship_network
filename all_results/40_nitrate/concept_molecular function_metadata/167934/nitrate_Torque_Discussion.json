    "context": "Ref. for review). As indicated above, at least in animals the effects of NO on muscle are greatest in such fibers; thus, electrical stimulation as used by Haider and Folland might favor finding a positive effect. In contrast, during a voluntary isometric contraction both slow-twitch, or type I, as well as type II fibers would be recruited, thus potentially \u201cdiluting\u201d the effects of NO produced via the NO3 \u2212 \u2192 NO2 \u2212 \u2192 NO pathway. A greater impact of NO3 \u2212-derived NO in type II vs. type I fibers would also explain why in the present study dietary NO3 \u2212 intake only improved muscle function at the highest angular velocity tested, since under these conditions the relative contribution of type II fibers to force/torque development would be greatest [38\u201340]. There are several limitations to the present study. We did not measure changes in plasma NO3 \u2212 or NO2 \u2212, and therefore cannot determine whether interindividual differences in NO3 \u2212 absorption and/or reduction to NO2 \u2212 accounted for the lack of improvement in muscle function in some subjects. We did, however, measure the ultimate effector molecule, i.e., NO, albeit only in breath. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3\u2212) is discussed in relation to its conversion to nitric oxide (NO) and its effects on muscle function, particularly in type II muscle fibers during isometric contractions. The study suggests that dietary nitrate intake may enhance torque development at higher angular velocities due to the greater recruitment of type II fibers, which are more responsive to NO. However, the relationship is not fully established as the study did not measure plasma nitrate or nitrite levels, leaving some uncertainty about individual responses to nitrate supplementation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and torque, as the context discusses how nitrate-derived NO influences muscle function and torque development, particularly in type II fibers. However, the lack of direct measurement of nitrate levels limits the strength of this relationship.",
