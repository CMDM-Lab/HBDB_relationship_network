    "context": "[5] Immunoblotting analysis of the cytoplasmic membrane samples prepared from Synechococcus cells was performed as described previously , using the antiserum against the NrtC polypeptide. [1] Synechococcus cells were grown at 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C with ammonium as the nitrogen source. [2] Nitrate transport activity was induced by transfer of the ammonium-grown cells to nitrite-containing medium followed by incubation under the growth conditions for 15 h. [3] Accumulation of intracellular nitrate was measured at 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C in the light in the presence of 20 \u00ce\u00bcm KNO3 and 10 mm NaHCO3, using the silicone oil filtering centrifugation technique and HPLC determination of nitrate as described previously . [1] NR and NiR activities were determined at 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2030\u00c2\u00b0C, using toluene-permeabilized cells with dithionite-reduced methylviologen as the electron donor . [2] Nitrate and nitrite were determined with a flow injection analyzer (NOX-1000W, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.). [3] Ammonium was determined as described by Anderson and Little . ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its transport and accumulation in Synechococcus cells, particularly under specific growth conditions. However, the term 'Adjudication' is not directly related to the biochemical processes involving nitrate. There is no clear connection or relevance between nitrate and adjudication in the provided context, as adjudication typically refers to a legal or decision-making process rather than a biochemical or physiological one.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of relationship between nitrate and adjudication, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct or indirect connection. Adjudication does not pertain to the biochemical processes involving nitrate.",
