    "context": "[1] As previously reported in other strains of cyanobacteria , nitrate utilization by the wild-type PCC 7942 strain was inhibited by ammonium and resumed after depletion of ammonium from the medium (Fig.5 C). [2] Unlike nitrite uptake, nitrate uptake by NC2 was completely and reversibly inhibited by ammonium (Fig. 5 D) as in the wild-type strain. [1] Uptake of nitrate, as measured by following the nitrate concentration in medium, includes jointly transport and reduction. [2] To determine specifically nitrate transport activity, intracellular nitrate accumulation in the light was measured in the NR-deficient mutants NR1  and NC4, which were constructed from the wild-type strain and NC2, respectively. [3] As observed previously in a mutant of strain PCC 7942 with no appreciable NR activity , NR1 accumulated about 1.5 mm of nitrate intracellularly at 20 \u00ce\u00bcm external nitrate concentration in the absence of ammonium but did not accumulate nitrate in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 6 A). [4] The targeted NR mutant with truncated nrtC, NC4, accumulated nitrate to a concentration similar to that observed in NR1 in the absence of ammonium and, unlike the NR1 mutant having wild-type nrtC, accumulated nitrate in the presence of ammonium as well, although the initial rate of nitrate accumulation and the final intracellular nitrate concentration were reduced by 60% by ammonium (Fig.6 B). [5] These findings showed that nitrate is actively transported into NC4 cells in the presence of ammonium. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate transport are closely related as the study investigates the mechanisms of nitrate uptake in cyanobacteria. The research highlights how nitrate transport is influenced by ammonium levels, demonstrating that nitrate is actively transported into cells, particularly in the presence of ammonium. The experiments with NR-deficient mutants further elucidate the specific transport activity of nitrate, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its transport mechanism within the cells.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and nitrate transport, as the context provides evidence of active transport mechanisms and the influence of ammonium on nitrate uptake, indicating a clear relationship supported by experimental data.",
