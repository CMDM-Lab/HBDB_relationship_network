    "context": "[4] The maintenance of intracellular nitrate accumulation in NC2 cells in the presence of ammonium but not in its absence suggested inhibition by ammonium of NR activity, in accordance with the complete inhibition by ammonium of nitrate uptake in NC2 (Fig. 5 D). [1] In NC2, the uptake of nitrite from the medium proceeded in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the nitrate/nitrite transporter of NC2 is much less susceptible to ammonium than the wild-type transporter. [2] This, however, apparently contradicted with the complete inhibition by ammonium of nitrate uptake by the mutant (Fig. 5 D). [3] Direct measurements of intracellular nitrate concentration, performed by HPLC determination of nitrate in acid lysates of the cell , showed that NC2 and its NR-less derivative (NC4) accumulate high concentrations of nitrate intracellularly in the presence of ammonium (Figs. 6, B andC). [4] These findings indicate the functioning of the nitrate/nitrite transporter with truncated NrtC in the presence of ammonium and hence the involvement of the C-terminal domain of NrtC in the ammonium-promoted inhibition of the transporter. [5] The inability of NC2 to assimilate nitrate in the presence of ammonium (Fig.5 D), despite its ability to accumulate nitrate intracellularly (Fig. 6 C), suggests that the reduction of intracellular nitrate by NR is also inhibited by ammonium. [6] Nitrite has been recently found to activate transcription of the nitrate assimilation operon in Synechococcus sp. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its uptake and accumulation in NC2 cells, particularly in the presence of ammonium, which inhibits nitrate reduction activity. However, the term 'Adjudication' does not appear to have a direct connection to the biochemical processes involving nitrate, as it is not mentioned in the context of nitrate metabolism or transport mechanisms. Therefore, the relationship between nitrate and adjudication is unclear and lacks direct relevance.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between nitrate and adjudication, as adjudication is not discussed in the context of nitrate metabolism or transport, indicating they are mentioned coincidentally without any direct relevance.",
