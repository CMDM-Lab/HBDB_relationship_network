    "context": "[2] The cell suspensions of the wild-type strain and NC2 (5 \u00ce\u00bcg Chl/ml) used 120 \u00ce\u00bcm of nitrate until its exhaustion in 30 min, whereas the NC3 cells could not utilize the low concentration of nitrate (Fig.4 B). [3] These findings indicated that NC2 is capable of active transport of nitrate but NC3 is not. [4] A derivative of NC3 carrying plasmid-borne nrtC (designated NC31) utilized nitrate until its exhaustion (Fig. 4 B), indicating that NrtC itself is essential for nitrate transport. [5] The ability of NC2, having the truncated NrtC, to transport nitrate therefore indicated that the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of NrtC but not the C-terminal domain is essential for the activity of the transporter.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its transport by the NrtC protein, specifically highlighting the importance of the N-terminal ATP-binding domain for its activity. The study indicates that the ability to transport nitrate is linked to the structural features of the NrtC protein, particularly its N-terminus, suggesting a direct relationship between nitrate utilization and protein N-terminus binding functionality.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and protein N-terminus binding, as the context provides evidence that the N-terminal domain of NrtC is essential for nitrate transport, indicating a clear functional relationship.",
