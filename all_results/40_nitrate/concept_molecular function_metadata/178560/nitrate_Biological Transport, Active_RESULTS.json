    "context": "[3] After the electrophoresis, polypeptides in the gel were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunostaining using the antiserum against the NrtC polypeptide. [1] In a medium containing 2 mm nitrate as the nitrogen source, NC2 grew as rapidly as the wild-type strain, whereas NC3 grew only poorly (Fig. 4 A). [2] The cell suspensions of the wild-type strain and NC2 (5 \u00ce\u00bcg Chl/ml) used 120 \u00ce\u00bcm of nitrate until its exhaustion in 30 min, whereas the NC3 cells could not utilize the low concentration of nitrate (Fig.4 B). [3] These findings indicated that NC2 is capable of active transport of nitrate but NC3 is not. [4] A derivative of NC3 carrying plasmid-borne nrtC (designated NC31) utilized nitrate until its exhaustion (Fig. 4 B), indicating that NrtC itself is essential for nitrate transport. [5] The ability of NC2, having the truncated NrtC, to transport nitrate therefore indicated that the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of NrtC but not the C-terminal domain is essential for the activity of the transporter. [1] Growth and nitrate uptake capability of the wild-type strain and the nrtC mutants. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is identified as a nitrogen source that is actively transported by certain strains of bacteria. The study highlights that the NC2 strain can utilize nitrate effectively through active transport, while the NC3 strain cannot. The NrtC polypeptide is essential for this active transport mechanism, indicating a direct relationship between nitrate and its biological transport process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and active biological transport, as the study provides evidence of active transport mechanisms involving nitrate and the specific role of the NrtC polypeptide in this process.",
