    "context": "Samples were kept on ice during lock-out and during a 5\u20137\u2009min delay before centrifugation. Saliva (3\u20134\u2009ml) was sampled before exposure, immediately after the second HBO2-period at 250\u2009kPa and directly after exposure.Laboratory methods 2.3.1 Nitrate and nitrite in plasma and saliva (EXP 1 and EXP 2) Blood and saliva samples were collected in prechilled vacuum tubes containing EDTA (250\u2009mM, 40\u2009\u00b5L per mL blood). The tubes were immediately centrifuged at 2000\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 10 minutes at +4\u2009\u00b0C, and aliquots of plasma and saliva were frozen (\u221220\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u20138\u2009hrs and then at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C) until analyzed. Nitrate and nitrite were determined by chemiluminescence after reductive cleavage and subsequent release of NO into the gas phase as described earlier in detail. In brief, plasma or saliva samples were introduced into a reaction vessel purged with nitrogen containing reducing solutions (iodine-iodide) and release of NO was analyzed by chemiluminescence (NO analyzer CLD 77AM, Ecophysics, D\u00fcrnten, Switzerland). NO peaks were further analyzed with the Windows Azur platform and the levels of nitrite and nitrate were calculated and reported in M (mol/L) by comparing the areas under the curve to known concentration of nitrite or nitrate. 2.3.2 ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned in relation to its measurement in plasma and saliva samples, but there is no direct discussion of its role in cytokinesis of the fertilized ovum. The focus is primarily on the analytical methods for determining nitrate and nitrite levels, without any exploration of how these compounds might influence or relate to the process of cytokinesis in fertilized ova. Therefore, the relationship between nitrate and cytokinesis is not established in this context.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any meaningful relationship between nitrate and cytokinesis of the fertilized ovum, as they are mentioned in the same context without any direct interaction or relevance discussed.",
