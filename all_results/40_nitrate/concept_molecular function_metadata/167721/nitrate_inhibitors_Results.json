    "context": "In EXP2 the nitrate levels were unchanged during and after HBO2 (Fig.\u20094).Plasma cGMP and citrulline/arginine ratio Plasma cGMP was used as surrogate markers of NO generation and was measured both in EXP1 and 2. In EXP1 plasma cGMP was unchanged compared to baseline after HBO2 and control treatment (Table\u20091). In EXP2 cGMP showed a significant increase during HBO2 (p\u2009=\u20090.0046) but values after treatment did not differ from baseline (Fig.\u20095 ). Citrulline and arginine were measured in EXP1 and the citrulline/arginine ratio was calculated as an indicator of NOS-activity. There was a slight but significant increase in citrulline/arginine ratio after both HBO2 and control (Table\u20091).In vitro effects of hyperoxia on oral bacteria The reduction in oral FENO and nitrite/nitrate ratio in saliva indicate an inhibitory effect of HBO2 on the serial reduction of nitrate and nitrite to NO in the oral cavity. Therefore, we wanted to investigate the effects of hyperoxia on nitrate and nitrite reduction by oral bacteria in vitro. First suspensions of oral tongue bacteria with addition of nitrate were bubbled with nitrogen, air and oxygen and the generation of nitrite was measured. Bubbling with air led to a 35% reduction of the bacterial conversion of nitrate to nitrite compared to nitrogen-bubbling. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate and inhibitors are related through the investigation of the effects of hyperoxia on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by oral bacteria. The study indicates that hyperoxia inhibits the bacterial conversion of nitrate to nitrite, suggesting that inhibitors may play a role in this process. However, the specific mechanisms or types of inhibitors involved are not detailed, leaving the relationship somewhat indirect.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as the context discusses the inhibitory effects of hyperoxia on nitrate reduction by oral bacteria, indicating a connection between nitrate and inhibitors. However, the lack of specific details about the inhibitors limits the strength of their relationship.",
