    "context": "Moreover, when nitrate was incubated with bacteria-containing saliva in nitrogen substantial amounts of NO gas were generated (Fig.\u20096B). This effect was almost abolished in the presence of 100% oxygen (Fig.\u20096B). The decrease in nitrite/nitrate ratio in saliva observed during HBO2 treatment could be due to rapid oxidation of nitrite to nitrate in vivo. However, when nitrite was exposed to 100% oxygen for 1\u2009h in vitro there was no loss of nitrite and no measurable generation of nitrate (not shown), indicating minimal oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (Fig.\u20096C). Finally, the reduction in exhaled NO found after HBO2 treatment in vivo could be due to oxidation of gaseous NO to NO2 during high oxygen tensions. However, when we incubated NO gas (100\u2009ppb) in pure oxygen for 5\u2009h we found only a slight reduction of NO (\u22127%, Fig.\u20096D). Together, these data indicate that HBO2-induced reduction in oral FENO depend to a high degree on inhibition of NO generation by oral bacteria. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its interaction with bacteria in saliva, leading to the generation of nitric oxide (NO) gas. The presence of 100% oxygen significantly inhibits this process, suggesting that oxidation plays a crucial role in the conversion of nitrite to nitrate. The findings indicate that oxidation affects the levels of NO and its precursors in the presence of high oxygen tensions, highlighting a significant relationship between nitrate and oxidation processes in vivo.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between nitrate and oxidation, as the context provides evidence of how oxidation influences the conversion of nitrite to nitrate and the generation of NO, indicating a clear biochemical interaction.",
