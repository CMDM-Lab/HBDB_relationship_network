    "context": "Exhaled NO Exhaled NO was measured in EXP1. Orally and nasally exhaled NO levels before exposure did not differ between control and HBO2. HBO2 induced a 30% decrease in oral FENO while there was no change after the control experiment (Table\u20091 , Fig.\u20092A and B ). HBO2 also led to a decrease by 16% in nasal FENO while control treatment had no effect (Table\u20091, Fig.\u20092C and D). When subtracting oral FENO from nasal FENO in order to get values more representative of the nasal airway NO production similar findings were observed; a 14% decrease in nasal FENO was seen after HBO2 while control had no effect (Table\u20091, Fig.\u20092E and F).Salivary nitrate and nitrite Oral nitrate and nitrite reducing bacteria contribute to NO levels in exhaled air and therefore salivary nitrite and nitrate levels were measured in EXP1 and EXP2. In EXP1 salivary nitrite and nitrate levels showed a substantial variation between subjects but there was no significant difference in any parameter between the groups before interventions. There were no changes in salivary nitrite and nitrate after HBO2 or control treatment (Table\u20091). As an indication of bacterial conversion of salivary nitrate to nitrite, the salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio was calculated, where a higher ratio indicates a higher conversion. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is indirectly related to exhalation through its role in the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the respiratory system. The study measures exhaled NO levels, which are influenced by salivary nitrate and nitrite levels, as these compounds are converted by bacteria to produce NO. However, the specific relationship between nitrate levels and exhalation is not quantitatively detailed, as the study primarily focuses on the effects of HBO2 on exhaled NO rather than a direct correlation with nitrate levels.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is involved in the biochemical pathway leading to NO production, which is measured in exhalation. However, the context does not provide a detailed analysis of how nitrate levels specifically affect exhalation, limiting the strength of their relationship.",
