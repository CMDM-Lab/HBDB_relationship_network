    "context": "While PENO and circulating plasma NOx were not significantly altered in hypobaric hypoxia with placebo during the current acute altitude exposure, others have reported gradual declines in PENO during the first 3\u00a0d\u00a0at 3800\u00a0m and a substantial decline in plasma NO reaction products following 24\u00a0h\u00a0at 3000\u00a0m. Given nitrate supplementation led to significant increases in plasma NOx, nitrites and PENO in the current investigation, there may be value in exploring this strategy to prevent, or reverse, the decline in PENO and circulating NOx that occurs with more prolonged altitude exposures to help mitigate hypoxic increases in pulmonary arterial pressure. We acknowledge that exhaled NO levels do not reflect pulmonary vascular function, yet an increase in upper airway NO production may increase axial back diffusion of NO into the alveoli and circulation that could offer protection from developing pulmonary hypertension. Although researchers have suggested that changes in pulmonary NO flux, as indicated from exhaled NO measurements, do not appear to significantly contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension during ascent to high altitude, the efficacy of nitrate supplementation in reducing pulmonary arterial pressure remains to be fully explored. In light of not measuring pulmonary arterial pressure, this remains a speculative, yet an attractive hypothesis for future research.Study limitations and strengths There were methodological limitations within the present study that deserve mention. Because two different exercise tests were performed within a very narrow window, we could not measure blood flow and StO2 with both CGrip and RGrip exercise protocols. The strain gauge, wrist and upper arm cuffs had to be fitted to a single arm so that measurements could be made immediately prior to and following CGrip exercise. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to exhalation through its role in increasing plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels, which may influence exhaled NO (PENO) production. The study suggests that nitrate supplementation could help mitigate declines in PENO during altitude exposure, potentially offering protective effects against pulmonary hypertension. However, the relationship is speculative, as exhaled NO levels do not directly reflect pulmonary vascular function.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 indicates a significant connection between nitrate and exhalation, supported by evidence of nitrate's effect on plasma NO levels and its potential implications for PENO. However, the speculative nature of the findings regarding pulmonary hypertension limits the score from reaching the highest level.",
