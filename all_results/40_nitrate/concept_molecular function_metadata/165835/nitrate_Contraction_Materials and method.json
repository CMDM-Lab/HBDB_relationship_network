    "context": "In a supine position, the subjects arm was fully extended by their side with the forearm raised slightly above the heart. The wrist cuff was inflated to 250\u00a0mmHg to exclude hand circulation and the upper arm cuff was inflated to 40\u00a0mmHg for 10\u00a0s (arterial inflow only), followed by 5\u00a0s of deflation (venous emptying). The mean of \u223c10 inflation/deflation cycles were used to determine resting blood flow which was measured after a minimum of 5\u00a0min of rest in the supine position. Blood flow cannot be assessed during exercise with plethysmography and rapidly drops upon cessation of exercise, thus the mean of the first 2-cuff deflation/pressurization measurements obtained immediately following CGrip exercise were used for analysis.Forearm exercise Prior to consuming the placebo or sodium nitrate drink, the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the left and right forearms were determined using an isometric hand dynamometer (TSD 121C, BIOPAC\u00ae Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA) interfaced with a transducer amplifier and the same acquisition system and software used for heart rate, systemic blood pressure and SaO2. The force output recordings were visible to the subjects on a laptop computer. The highest value obtained from three attempts for each hand was used to determine the initial work load for continuous (CGrip) and rhythmic (RGrip) isometric grip endurance tests. CGrip exercise consisted of left hand grip isometric contractions at 40% MVC until task failure, defined as the time (s) when subjects could no longer maintain grip force within 5% of the target. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned in relation to forearm exercise and muscle contraction. The study involves measuring maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the forearms before consuming a sodium nitrate drink, suggesting that nitrate may influence muscle performance during isometric contractions. However, the specific effects of nitrate on contraction dynamics are not detailed in the provided text.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as nitrate is linked to muscle contraction through its potential effects on exercise performance, but the context does not provide detailed evidence or direct interaction between nitrate and contraction.",
