    "context": "In addition to the plasma responses, sodium nitrate increased PENO (24%) during hypobaric hypoxia testing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and remained significantly elevated during post-altitude testing. In contrast, no changes in PENO occurred following consumption of the sodium chloride placebo solution.Resting physiological parameters The concentration of hemoglobin did not differ between experimental trials (Table\u00a03 ). Hypobaric hypoxia resulted in reduced SaO2 and estimated CaO2 (\u221223 \u00b1\u00a02%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and StO2 (\u221212 \u00b1\u00a01%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while heart rate increased by 18 \u00b1\u00a03% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), changes that were independent of treatment. There was a significant condition  \u00d7 treatment interaction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for MAP, however, post hoc testing only identified a trend for a reduction in MAP in hypobaric hypoxia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.074) with sodium nitrate compared to placebo. Trends for a reduction in MAP and increased forearm blood flow (p\u00a0=\u00a00.080) in hypobaric hypoxia did, however, result in a significant reduction in forearm vascular resistance (\u221224 \u00b1\u00a05%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and maintenance of oxygen delivery, independent of treatment.CGrip and RGrip forearm exercise A very high degree of reliability was found between MVC tests performed on the left and right hand. The ICC for the left hand was 0.973 (95% CI: 0.893\u20130.993) and 0.958 (95% CI: 0.831\u20130.990) ",

        "summary": "In this context, sodium nitrate is evaluated for its physiological effects during hypobaric hypoxia testing, particularly its impact on parameters like PENO and MAP. However, there is no direct discussion of drug interactions related to nitrate. The focus is primarily on nitrate's effects on blood flow and oxygen delivery rather than its interactions with other drugs or substances.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as sodium nitrate is studied for its physiological effects, but there is no detailed discussion or evidence of its interactions with drugs. The relationship is more about its standalone effects rather than any pharmacological interactions.",
