    "context": "Whether nitrate supplementation is ergogenic at high altitude currently remains unknown because most of the investigations exploring this question have been conducted in normobaric hypoxia with inconsistent results [11,13\u201315,17\u201321]. Presently, to our knowledge only one investigation has examined the ergogenic potential of nitrate supplementation in hypobaric hypoxia (3500\u00a0m) with the only significant observation being a reduction in blood lactate at submaximal VO2max (40 and 50%). Given the paucity of data exploring the benefits of nitrate supplement in hypobaric hypoxia, we sought out to determine the ergogenic potential of oral sodium nitrate supplementation to improve the physiological responses to exercise performed under hypobaric hypoxia conditions in healthy individuals. By employing a moderate to high intensity isometric hand grip exercise protocol and measuring determinants of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation, we examined the effects of acute nitrate supplementation on forearm exercise performance at 4300\u00a0m in a hypobaric chamber. Our hypothesis was that by increasing NO bioactive product availability through acute nitrate supplementation, forearm blood flow and tissue oxygenation will be enhanced and forearm exercise performance at high altitude will be improved. Subjects Ten healthy, recreationally active, adults (9 males, 1 female) with a mean (\u00b1SEM) age of 33.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1 years, weight of 85.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0kg, height of 179.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0cm, and a body mass index of 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122 volunteered to participate in this research. All subjects resided at sea level and were unacclimatized to high altitude. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is investigated for its potential ergogenic effects on oxygen transport during exercise in hypobaric hypoxia. The study hypothesizes that acute nitrate supplementation may enhance nitric oxide (NO) availability, thereby improving forearm blood flow and tissue oxygenation, which are critical for effective oxygen transport during high-altitude exercise. The relationship is explored through physiological measurements, indicating a direct connection between nitrate supplementation and improved oxygen transport mechanisms.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and oxygen transport, as the study directly examines how nitrate supplementation may enhance physiological responses related to oxygen delivery during exercise at high altitude, supported by the hypothesis and experimental design.",
        "score": 4
