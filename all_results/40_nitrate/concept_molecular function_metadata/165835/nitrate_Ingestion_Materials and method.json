    "context": "All subjects resided at sea level and were unacclimatized to high altitude. Twenty-four hours prior to the experiments, subjects were instructed to avoid high nitrite and nitrate containing foods (provided a list), alcohol, mouthwash, and refrain from exercise. All study participants provided written informed consent prior to completing the study that was approved by the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory's (NSMRL) Institutional Review Board (protocol NSMRL2013.0003) in compliance with all applicable federal regulations governing the protection of human subjects.Study design In a double-blinded randomized-cross over manner, participants completed pre-intervention testing at sea level (baseline), followed by testing in hypobaric hypoxia (4300\u00a0m equivalent) and post-hypobaric hypoxia at sea level after consuming a single bolus of 500\u00a0mL of a placebo (sodium chloride, 14\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 body weight) or nitrate (sodium nitrate, 20\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 body weight, \u223c15\u00a0mmols of nitrate) drink. This dose was selected based on previous research, and a pilot study conducted in a subset of subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a03) that assessed the responses of nitric oxide reaction products (NOx), nitrites and exhaled nitric oxide (PENO) over 5\u00a0h following ingestion of 500\u00a0mL of sodium nitrate (20\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121). The experimental testing timeline and variables measured are described below and presented in Table\u00a01 . On testing days, volunteers arrived at the laboratory between 7:30\u20138:30 a.m., and a baseline blood sample was obtained from the antecubital vein in lithium heparin and EDTA containing collection tubes. Subsequent samples were obtained in hypobaric hypoxia and post-hypobaric hypoxia. ",

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is directly related to ingestion as participants consumed a sodium nitrate drink (20 mg kg\u22121 body weight) as part of a study investigating its effects on nitric oxide reaction products. The study design emphasizes the importance of nitrate ingestion in assessing physiological responses during hypobaric hypoxia, highlighting its role in the experimental protocol.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as nitrate is a key component of the intervention (ingestion of sodium nitrate) being studied for its physiological effects. The context clearly establishes a direct relationship between nitrate and its ingestion, integral to the research design.",
        "score": 5
