    "context": "Since hypobaric hypoxia elicits greater physiological strain than normobaric hypoxia, the ergogenic potential of nitrates may be much greater when performing work in the former condition. Whether nitrate supplementation is ergogenic at high altitude currently remains unknown because most of the investigations exploring this question have been conducted in normobaric hypoxia with inconsistent results [11,13\u201315,17\u201321]. Presently, to our knowledge only one investigation has examined the ergogenic potential of nitrate supplementation in hypobaric hypoxia (3500\u00a0m) with the only significant observation being a reduction in blood lactate at submaximal VO2max (40 and 50%). Given the paucity of data exploring the benefits of nitrate supplement in hypobaric hypoxia, we sought out to determine the ergogenic potential of oral sodium nitrate supplementation to improve the physiological responses to exercise performed under hypobaric hypoxia conditions in healthy individuals. By employing a moderate to high intensity isometric hand grip exercise protocol and measuring determinants of oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation, we examined the effects of acute nitrate supplementation on forearm exercise performance at 4300\u00a0m in a hypobaric chamber. Our hypothesis was that by increasing NO bioactive product availability through acute nitrate supplementation, forearm blood flow and tissue oxygenation will be enhanced and forearm exercise performance at high altitude will be improved. Subjects Ten healthy, recreationally active, adults (9 males, 1 female) with a mean (\u00b1SEM) age of 33.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1 years, weight of 85.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0kg, height of 179.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0cm, and a body mass index of 26.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122 volunteered to participate in this research.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate is investigated for its potential ergogenic effects during exercise in hypobaric hypoxia, which presents greater physiological challenges than normobaric hypoxia. The study aims to determine if nitrate supplementation can enhance blood flow, tissue oxygenation, and exercise performance at high altitudes, suggesting a direct relationship between nitrate and hypoxia in optimizing physiological responses under low oxygen conditions.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between nitrate and hypoxia, as the study explores how nitrate supplementation may improve physiological responses during exercise in hypoxic conditions, supported by the hypothesis of enhanced blood flow and oxygen transport.",
        "score": 4
