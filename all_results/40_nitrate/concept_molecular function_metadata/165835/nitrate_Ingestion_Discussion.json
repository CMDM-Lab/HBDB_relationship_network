    "context": "In this investigation, the authors reported an increase in the concentration of plasma nitrates within 20\u00a0min, but a delayed rise in nitrites (1.5\u00a0h) that preceded the increase in cGMP. In the current experiment, the mean time that the participants completed CGrip and RGrip exercise testing at 4300\u00a0m following sodium nitrate consumption was 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0h and 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0h, respectively, times that did not differ following placebo ingestion. Plasma NOx and nitrite levels determined during the time course pilot study conducted at sea level, and during the experiment (hypobaric hypoxia and post-hypobaric hypoxia) suggest that the dosing protocol and timing of the physiological tests occurred when the bioavailability of nitrates and nitrites was enhanced from nitrate supplementation. However, it is of note that the coefficient of variation for the plasma nitrite response to sodium nitrate ingestion was 62% and nearly twice the coefficient of variation for plasma nitrate determined at the same time (27%). While plasma nitrates peaked in hypobaric hypoxia and were sustained following return to sea level, the large inter-individual variability in nitrite responses may have resulted in some subjects being tested at a time point when plasma nitrite levels were suboptimal during the sodium nitrate loading trials. Since the primary pathway for dietary nitrate uptake and conversion to nitrite occurs in the oral cavity via the action of commensal bacteria, between subject differences in oral microbiome may have contributed to variable nitrite uptake following oral consumption of nitrate. If NOx or nitrite bioavailability are primary mediators of the ergogenic potential of nitrate supplementation, then a significant relationship between the relative increase in plasma NOx or nitrites and the relative changes in CGrip and RGrip exercise tests post-nitrate consumption should have been evident.

        "summary": "In this context, nitrate ingestion is directly linked to the physiological response observed in plasma nitrate and nitrite levels. Following sodium nitrate consumption, there is a rapid increase in plasma nitrates, which is crucial for subsequent physiological effects, such as the rise in cGMP. The study highlights the importance of dietary nitrate uptake and its conversion to nitrite in the oral cavity, indicating that ingestion of nitrates plays a significant role in enhancing their bioavailability and subsequent physiological responses during exercise testing.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between nitrate and ingestion, as the context discusses the effects of nitrate ingestion on plasma levels and physiological responses, supported by experimental data. However, the variability in individual responses prevents a perfect score.",
