    "context": "Then, we evaluated the ability of tested Bcc strains to grow on a modified TYP solid media buffered at different pHs (in the range 7.0\u20139.0). Data obtained are shown in Table 2 whose analysis revealed that with the exception of B. multivorans LMG 13010, all the other Bcc strains used in this work were able to grow up to 8.5, and six of them grew at pH9.0. Combining the information reported in Table 2, it is clear that the methylamine sensitivity spectrum of tested Bcc strains do not correspond with their respective ability to grow at alkaline pHs. Therefore, although in case of B. multivorans LMG 13010 we cannot exclude the possibility that the methylamine mode of action consists in a not permissive pH increase of growth medium, the other tested Bcc strains seem to be inhibited by methylamine regardless of pH variation. Discussion Over the last years, we have reported the ability of many marine Antarctic strains, including the model organism P. haloplanktis TAC125, to produce VOCs able to inhibit the growth of B. cepacia complex strains. This inhibition ability was demonstrated using the classical cross-streaking experimental conditions, which implies the growth of the Antarctic strains on solid medium. In the present work, we demonstrated that P. haloplanktis TAC125 is able to synthesize anti-Bcc VOCs even when grown in liquid medium, and that when P. haloplanktis TAC125 is grown on GG solid medium, it is unable to inhibit the growth of the Bcc target strains.

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is mentioned in relation to its effects on the growth of Bcc strains in alkaline pH conditions. While the study evaluates the growth of these strains at various pH levels, including alkaline conditions, there is no direct discussion of alkalemia, which refers to an excess of base in the body fluids. The relationship between methanamine and alkalemia is not explicitly established, as the focus is on microbial growth rather than physiological pH imbalances.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as methanamine's effects on microbial growth at alkaline pH levels are noted, but there is no detailed discussion of its relevance to alkalemia or any physiological implications.",
