    "context": "These findings suggest that L-methionine catabolism of P. haloplanktis TAC125 offers several aspects of novelty thus supporting the idea that P. haloplanktis TAC125 evolved unknown metabolic routes for the use of this amino acid, some of which may end up with the production of methylamine. It is interesting to note that almost 11% of the protein encoding genes identified in P. haloplanktis TAC125 genome have still no homologous in any other organism. Even though methylamine was never identified amongst the VOCs released by P. haloplanktis TAC125 when grown in complex media, we focused our attention on it, since the antimicrobial activity of this amine was never reported. Methylamine is able to inhibit the growth of several Bcc strains at different concentrations by a still unknown mode of action, not related to a nonspecific pH increase. For all tested Bcc strains methylamine MVIC resulted to be in a mM concentration range, making unrealistic its use as single antibiotic agent, and supporting the idea that methylamine is not the only antibacterial VOC produced by P. haloplanktis TAC125 in GGM medium. However, data reported in this paper demonstrated that methylamine contributes to the anti-Bcc activity of P. haloplanktis TAC125 VOCs. Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are potential sources of offensive odors causing annoyance in neighboring urban areas. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its potential antimicrobial activity and metabolic pathways in the bacterium P. haloplanktis TAC125. However, there is no direct mention or exploration of alkalemia, which refers to a condition of increased blood pH. The relationship between methanamine and alkalemia is not established, as the focus is primarily on the metabolic processes and antimicrobial properties of methanamine without linking it to pH changes or alkalemia.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a lack of any direct or indirect relationship between methanamine and alkalemia in the context provided. They are mentioned separately without any discussion of how one may influence or relate to the other.",
