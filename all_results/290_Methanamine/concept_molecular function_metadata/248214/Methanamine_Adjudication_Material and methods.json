    "context": "A preliminary identification of the molecules synthesized was performed by SPME-GC\u2013MS. In detail, the tentative identification of the volatile components was based on comparison of their mass spectra with those of NIST 2.0 as well as by comparison of their retention indexes with the literature data. As for methylamine, each condensed molecule was identified by its fragmentation mass spectrum and comparison between its retention time (1.58) and the retention time of a standard. Definition of Bcc strains sensitivity to methylamine and determination of Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) is defined as the lowest methylamine concentration that showed no visible growth of the streaked tester strain after 96h at 20\u00b0C. The gaseous methylamine was obtained through in situ acid-base reaction between sodium hydroxide and methylamine hydrochloride salt (SIGMA code: M0505): CH3NH2 HCl+NaO excess \u2192CH3NH2 \u2191+NaCl+H2O The number of moles of methylamine hydrochloride (CH3NH2 HCl), which are placed to react with the base solution, corresponds to the number of gaseous methylamine (CH3NH2\u2191) moles released. To define the final gaseous methylamine concentration, we consider the volume of the hermetically sealed incubation box (2L). For instance, to test on Bcc strains a final concentration of 10mM gaseous methylamine in a 2L sealed box, 1.35g (corresponding to 20mM) of methylamine hydrochloride salt were dissolved in a 1mL of distilled water; then 200\u03bcL of sodium hydroxide 10M were added, developing 20mM of gaseous methylamine.

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its synthesis and identification through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, particularly focusing on its role in determining the Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) for certain bacterial strains. However, there is no mention or connection to 'adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making, indicating a lack of relevance between the two terms.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects that methanamine and adjudication are mentioned in the same context but have no direct or indirect relationship. Methanamine is discussed in a chemical analysis context, while adjudication is unrelated to the chemical processes described.",
