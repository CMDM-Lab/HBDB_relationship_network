    "context": "Then, we evaluated the ability of tested Bcc strains to grow on a modified TYP solid media buffered at different pHs (in the range 7.0\u20139.0). Data obtained are shown in Table 2 whose analysis revealed that with the exception of B. multivorans LMG 13010, all the other Bcc strains used in this work were able to grow up to 8.5, and six of them grew at pH9.0. Combining the information reported in Table 2, it is clear that the methylamine sensitivity spectrum of tested Bcc strains do not correspond with their respective ability to grow at alkaline pHs. Therefore, although in case of B. multivorans LMG 13010 we cannot exclude the possibility that the methylamine mode of action consists in a not permissive pH increase of growth medium, the other tested Bcc strains seem to be inhibited by methylamine regardless of pH variation. Discussion Over the last years, we have reported the ability of many marine Antarctic strains, including the model organism P. haloplanktis TAC125, to produce VOCs able to inhibit the growth of B. cepacia complex strains. This inhibition ability was demonstrated using the classical cross-streaking experimental conditions, which implies the growth of the Antarctic strains on solid medium. In the present work, we demonstrated that P. haloplanktis TAC125 is able to synthesize anti-Bcc VOCs even when grown in liquid medium, and that when P. haloplanktis TAC125 is grown on GG solid medium, it is unable to inhibit the growth of the Bcc target strains.

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its inhibitory effects on the growth of Bcc strains, suggesting a potential biological function related to growth permissiveness. The study indicates that while some strains can grow at alkaline pH levels, their growth is inhibited by methanamine, implying that the compound may affect the permissiveness of the growth environment for these bacteria. However, the exact biological function of methanamine in this context remains unclear, as it does not directly correlate with pH tolerance.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as methanamine's inhibitory effects on Bcc strains suggest a connection to biological function and growth permissiveness, but the relationship lacks detailed exploration and direct evidence of how methanamine specifically influences these functions.",
