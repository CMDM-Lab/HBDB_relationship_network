    "context": "Aerial exposure to 10mM methylamine enhances TYP medium pH to 8.2\u00b10.2, while 20mM methylamine treatment increases medium final pH to 8.8\u00b10.2. Then, we evaluated the ability of tested Bcc strains to grow on a modified TYP solid media buffered at different pHs (in the range 7.0\u20139.0). Data obtained are shown in Table 2 whose analysis revealed that with the exception of B. multivorans LMG 13010, all the other Bcc strains used in this work were able to grow up to 8.5, and six of them grew at pH9.0. Combining the information reported in Table 2, it is clear that the methylamine sensitivity spectrum of tested Bcc strains do not correspond with their respective ability to grow at alkaline pHs. Therefore, although in case of B. multivorans LMG 13010 we cannot exclude the possibility that the methylamine mode of action consists in a not permissive pH increase of growth medium, the other tested Bcc strains seem to be inhibited by methylamine regardless of pH variation. Discussion Over the last years, we have reported the ability of many marine Antarctic strains, including the model organism P. haloplanktis TAC125, to produce VOCs able to inhibit the growth of B. cepacia complex strains. This inhibition ability was demonstrated using the classical cross-streaking experimental conditions, which implies the growth of the Antarctic strains on solid medium. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its effect on the pH of the growth medium, which is relevant to the concept of alkalies. The treatment with methylamine raises the pH of the medium, indicating a shift towards more alkaline conditions. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, as the study primarily focuses on the growth of Bcc strains at various pH levels rather than a direct interaction between methanamine and alkalies. The inhibition of bacterial growth by methylamine appears to be independent of the pH changes induced.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as methanamine's effect on pH suggests a connection to alkalies, but the context does not provide a detailed exploration of their interaction or significance beyond pH changes.",
