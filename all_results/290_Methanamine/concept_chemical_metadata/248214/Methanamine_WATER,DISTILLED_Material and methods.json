    "context": "Definition of Bcc strains sensitivity to methylamine and determination of Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) is defined as the lowest methylamine concentration that showed no visible growth of the streaked tester strain after 96h at 20\u00b0C. The gaseous methylamine was obtained through in situ acid-base reaction between sodium hydroxide and methylamine hydrochloride salt (SIGMA code: M0505): CH3NH2 HCl+NaO excess \u2192CH3NH2 \u2191+NaCl+H2O The number of moles of methylamine hydrochloride (CH3NH2 HCl), which are placed to react with the base solution, corresponds to the number of gaseous methylamine (CH3NH2\u2191) moles released. To define the final gaseous methylamine concentration, we consider the volume of the hermetically sealed incubation box (2L). For instance, to test on Bcc strains a final concentration of 10mM gaseous methylamine in a 2L sealed box, 1.35g (corresponding to 20mM) of methylamine hydrochloride salt were dissolved in a 1mL of distilled water; then 200\u03bcL of sodium hydroxide 10M were added, developing 20mM of gaseous methylamine. The boxes containing the target strains were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 4 days. Then the plates were recovered and placed at 37\u00b0C for further 2 days, to allow cells to grow on solid medium. Measurement of pH The pH of TYP liquid medium (1mL volume) exposed to methylamine in the hermetically sealed incubation (Fig. 2(a)) was determined using Instruments XS, pHmeter Orto lab S.n.c. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is produced through a chemical reaction involving methylamine hydrochloride and sodium hydroxide, with distilled water serving as a solvent for the methylamine hydrochloride. The distilled water is essential for dissolving the salt to facilitate the generation of gaseous methylamine, indicating a functional relationship where water is a necessary component in the preparation of methanamine for the experiment.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between methanamine and distilled water, as distilled water is used as a solvent in the reaction to produce methanamine. This relationship is crucial for the experimental setup, demonstrating a clear functional dependency.",
