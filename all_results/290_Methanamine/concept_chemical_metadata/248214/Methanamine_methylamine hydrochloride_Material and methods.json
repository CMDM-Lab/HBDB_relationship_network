    "context": "In detail, the tentative identification of the volatile components was based on comparison of their mass spectra with those of NIST 2.0 as well as by comparison of their retention indexes with the literature data. As for methylamine, each condensed molecule was identified by its fragmentation mass spectrum and comparison between its retention time (1.58) and the retention time of a standard. Definition of Bcc strains sensitivity to methylamine and determination of Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) is defined as the lowest methylamine concentration that showed no visible growth of the streaked tester strain after 96h at 20\u00b0C. The gaseous methylamine was obtained through in situ acid-base reaction between sodium hydroxide and methylamine hydrochloride salt (SIGMA code: M0505): CH3NH2 HCl+NaO excess \u2192CH3NH2 \u2191+NaCl+H2O The number of moles of methylamine hydrochloride (CH3NH2 HCl), which are placed to react with the base solution, corresponds to the number of gaseous methylamine (CH3NH2\u2191) moles released. To define the final gaseous methylamine concentration, we consider the volume of the hermetically sealed incubation box (2L). For instance, to test on Bcc strains a final concentration of 10mM gaseous methylamine in a 2L sealed box, 1.35g (corresponding to 20mM) of methylamine hydrochloride salt were dissolved in a 1mL of distilled water; then 200\u03bcL of sodium hydroxide 10M were added, developing 20mM of gaseous methylamine. The boxes containing the target strains were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 4 days. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine hydrochloride are directly related through a chemical reaction process. Methylamine hydrochloride serves as a precursor to generate gaseous methylamine via an acid-base reaction with sodium hydroxide. The amount of methylamine produced is quantitatively linked to the amount of methylamine hydrochloride used, indicating a clear functional relationship between the two compounds in the experimental setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a strong relevance, as methanamine is produced directly from the reaction of methylamine hydrochloride, establishing a critical and well-defined relationship in the context of the study.",
