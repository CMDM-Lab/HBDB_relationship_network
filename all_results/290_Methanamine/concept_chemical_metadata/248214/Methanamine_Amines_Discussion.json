    "context": "The genome of P. haloplanktis TAC125 was in silico analysed looking for the intracellular L-methionine destiny (data not shown), and this analysis revealed the absence of the genes encoding some key enzymes involved in previously reported L-methionine degradation pathways. These findings suggest that L-methionine catabolism of P. haloplanktis TAC125 offers several aspects of novelty thus supporting the idea that P. haloplanktis TAC125 evolved unknown metabolic routes for the use of this amino acid, some of which may end up with the production of methylamine. It is interesting to note that almost 11% of the protein encoding genes identified in P. haloplanktis TAC125 genome have still no homologous in any other organism. Even though methylamine was never identified amongst the VOCs released by P. haloplanktis TAC125 when grown in complex media, we focused our attention on it, since the antimicrobial activity of this amine was never reported. Methylamine is able to inhibit the growth of several Bcc strains at different concentrations by a still unknown mode of action, not related to a nonspecific pH increase. For all tested Bcc strains methylamine MVIC resulted to be in a mM concentration range, making unrealistic its use as single antibiotic agent, and supporting the idea that methylamine is not the only antibacterial VOC produced by P. haloplanktis TAC125 in GGM medium. However, data reported in this paper demonstrated that methylamine contributes to the anti-Bcc activity of P. haloplanktis TAC125 VOCs. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine is identified as a specific type of amine that may be produced during the catabolism of L-methionine in P. haloplanktis TAC125. The study highlights the potential antimicrobial properties of methylamine, a derivative of methanamine, suggesting a functional relationship where methanamine contributes to the broader category of amines with biological activity. However, the focus is primarily on methylamine rather than a detailed exploration of its relationship with other amines.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as methanamine is a specific example of an amine discussed in the context of its potential antimicrobial activity. While there is a connection, the relationship is not extensively detailed beyond the mention of methanamine's role in producing methylamine.",
