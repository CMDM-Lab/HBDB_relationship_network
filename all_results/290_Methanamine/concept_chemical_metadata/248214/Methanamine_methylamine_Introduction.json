    "context": "Since it was demonstrated that the ability of P. haloplanktis TAC125 to inhibit the growth of Bcc was influenced by the specific growth medium composition, the aim of this work was to explore the ability of this bacterium to synthesize anti-Bcc VOCs when grown in different cultivation conditions. When P. haloplanktis TAC125 was grown in a specific defined medium it was unable to inhibit the Bcc growth, while when grown in the same medium enriched by single selected amino acids, such as L-methionine, the bacterium was able to inhibit the growth of tested Bcc strains by VOC production. Then, we set up an apparatus, based on the use of an automatic fermenter, to capture and accumulate VOCs, which allowed the identification of methylamine as one of VOCs produced when L-methionine was added to the defined medium. Finally antimicrobial activity of methylamine against several Bcc strains was evaluated. Material and methods Bacterial strains and growth conditions Bcc strains (Table 1S), Escherichia coli K12 and P. haloplanktis TAC125 were grown at 20\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C (depending on the specific assay to be carried out) on TYP medium (16g/L yeast extract, 16g/L bacto peptone, 10g/L NaCl) containing agar (15g/L). Each of the ten Bcc strain used in this work (Table 1S) was grown on TYP solid medium or on buffered TYP at different pH values. Buffering of TYP medium was obtained by adding 20mM Tris buffer at different pH; in this way buffered TYP media with a different pH (7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, and 9.0) were obtained. ",

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine are related as methylamine is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) produced by the bacterium P. haloplanktis TAC125 when grown in a medium enriched with L-methionine. While methanamine is not explicitly mentioned as a product, it is structurally related to methylamine, suggesting a potential connection in the metabolic pathways involved in VOC production. However, the focus is primarily on methylamine's antimicrobial activity against Bcc strains, with methanamine's role remaining unclear.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both methanamine and methylamine are related through their structural similarity and potential metabolic pathways, but the context primarily emphasizes methylamine's production and activity without a detailed discussion of methanamine's role.",
        "score": 3
