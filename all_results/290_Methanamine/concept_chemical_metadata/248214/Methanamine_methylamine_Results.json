    "context": "Then, we evaluated the ability of tested Bcc strains to grow on a modified TYP solid media buffered at different pHs (in the range 7.0\u20139.0). Data obtained are shown in Table 2 whose analysis revealed that with the exception of B. multivorans LMG 13010, all the other Bcc strains used in this work were able to grow up to 8.5, and six of them grew at pH9.0. Combining the information reported in Table 2, it is clear that the methylamine sensitivity spectrum of tested Bcc strains do not correspond with their respective ability to grow at alkaline pHs. Therefore, although in case of B. multivorans LMG 13010 we cannot exclude the possibility that the methylamine mode of action consists in a not permissive pH increase of growth medium, the other tested Bcc strains seem to be inhibited by methylamine regardless of pH variation. Discussion Over the last years, we have reported the ability of many marine Antarctic strains, including the model organism P. haloplanktis TAC125, to produce VOCs able to inhibit the growth of B. cepacia complex strains. This inhibition ability was demonstrated using the classical cross-streaking experimental conditions, which implies the growth of the Antarctic strains on solid medium. In the present work, we demonstrated that P. haloplanktis TAC125 is able to synthesize anti-Bcc VOCs even when grown in liquid medium, and that when P. haloplanktis TAC125 is grown on GG solid medium, it is unable to inhibit the growth of the Bcc target strains.

        "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine are related as both are amines that can influence the growth of Bcc strains. The study discusses the sensitivity of Bcc strains to methylamine, indicating that while some strains can grow at alkaline pH levels, they are inhibited by methylamine regardless of pH. This suggests a potential interaction between these two compounds in terms of microbial growth inhibition, although methanamine is not explicitly mentioned as being tested in the same capacity.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as both methanamine and methylamine are discussed in relation to their effects on Bcc strains, indicating a connection in their roles as growth inhibitors, but the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored.",
