    "context": "The main scope of this work was to determine the most active group VIII metal catalysts for the removal of this VOC mixture. Among them Pt and Pd supported on alumina and titania were the most active metals for benzene and butanol oxidation. V2O5\u2013WO3/TiO2 catalyst, recognized as combining high activity and selectivity together with a strong stability in Cl2\u2013HCl environments, has been studied in the oxidation of various compounds by Everaert and Baeyens. This work is mainly focused on chlorinated VOC but butanol oxidation experiment has also been performed and the activation energy for the butanol is done in comparison with other VOC in the presence of V2O5\u2013WO3/TiO2 catalyst The present work describes different Zr\u2013Ce\u2013Mn\u2013O catalytic systems synthesized using a sol\u2013gel method. Generally the sol\u2013gel method has been recognized as an interesting way to prepare catalysts with the control of their texture, composition, homogeneity and structural properties. The focus is to optimize the performances of the Zr\u2013Ce\u2013Mn oxides for complete oxidation of n-butanol by examining the effect of Mn amount.
