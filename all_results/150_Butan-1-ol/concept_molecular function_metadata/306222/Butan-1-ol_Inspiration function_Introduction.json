    "context": "But the interactions between MnO x and CeO2 vary with the composition and the optimum Mn/Ce ratio depends on (i) the catalyst synthesis method and (ii) the nature of the pollutant to be destroyed. Besides it is well known that formation of mixed oxides of ceria with Zr4+ enhanced oxygen storage properties of ceria and the so-formed mixed oxides exhibited good thermal stability. Butanol enters the environment from either natural sources or during its production, transport, storage and use as a chemical intermediate and a solvent. The primary route for entering the environment is the release to the atmosphere when used as a solvent for paints, coatings, varnishes, resins, gums, vegetable oils, etc. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butanol is produced or used. n-Butanol is not classifiable as to human and animal carcinogenicity. However a 10 year study, conducted of men exposed to this compound (>200ppm of n-butanol) in an industrial setting, revealed ocular symptoms included a burning sensation, blurring of vision, lachrymation, and photophobia. Animal exposed to n-butanol in air may manifest ataxia, central nervous system depression, prostration. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is discussed primarily in relation to its environmental exposure and potential health effects, particularly through inhalation in occupational settings. While the text mentions symptoms such as central nervous system depression and ocular issues, it does not explicitly connect these effects to the inspiration function or respiratory health. Therefore, the relationship between butan-1-ol and inspiration function is implied but not directly addressed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects an indirect connection, as butan-1-ol exposure may affect respiratory function through inhalation, but the context does not provide detailed evidence or discussion linking it specifically to inspiration function.",
