    "context": "Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 solid solutions were successfully synthesized by a sol\u2013gel method, characterized and tested for the total oxidation of butanol. The catalytic results were mainly explained by the textural (SSA and crystallite size), and bulk/surface properties (oxygen mobility and Mn4+ concentration). The presence of both Ce4+/Ce3+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples led to excellent catalytic activity for n-butanol complete oxidation with an activity maximum for x =0.36. The flavors and fragrances industry recorded total sales of over US$ 18 billion in 2006. Given the financial investments involved, it is not surprising that these industries are using chemical analytical methods for tasks ranging from quality control to product development/characterization. The most popular method for characterization of the flavor/fragrance profiles of complex samples is gas chromatography [2\u201323], often coupled with solid-phase micro extraction (SPME) [4\u201314] and/or mass spectrometric detection (GC\u2013MS) [5\u201322] or olfactory detection (GCO) [21\u201324].
