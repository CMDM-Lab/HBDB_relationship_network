    "context": "The bitmap is fed into the ANN and received as a large matrix that is then synthesized by the ANN as a vapor response while simultaneously reducing the number of training sets and number of sensor in an array. Complex mixture characterization is possible by using the 2D bitmapping approach in concert with the ANN. The ability permits characterization of base flavors and quantitation of adulterants found in base flavors. Materials The following solvents were used for vapor generation: benzene, toluene, chlorobenzene, 2-butanone, 1-butanol, methanol, toluene, and water. The organic solvents are commercially available with a purity of 99% or greater. Polymers used for sensor coating were obtained from Aldrich and are outlined in Table 1 . Flavor contamination studies used the following materials: artificial strawberry base oil 140-D (Flavors of North America), thiogeraniol (Penta), ethyl formate (Aldrich), and 4-methyl-2-pentanone also known as MIBK (Aldrich).SAW sensors, feedback oscillatory circuits, data collection SAW devices used for these studies were obtained from Microsensor Systems Inc. (Bowling Green, KY). ",

        "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol and toluene are both mentioned as solvents used for vapor generation in a study involving artificial flavor contamination and sensor technology. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance within the study. They are simply listed among other solvents without any indication of a direct relationship or functional connection.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as butan-1-ol and toluene are included in the same context as solvents but lack any direct interaction or detailed relationship. Their mention is coincidental rather than indicative of a significant connection.",
