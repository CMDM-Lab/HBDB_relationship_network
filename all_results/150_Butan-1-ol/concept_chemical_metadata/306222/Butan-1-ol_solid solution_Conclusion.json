    "context": "This comparison with commercial catalysts illustrates the excellent behaviour of the Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 catalytic system for oxygenated VOC removal since n-butanol conversion of 90% is obtained at 175\u00b0C for x =0.36 value. Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 solid solutions were successfully synthesized by a sol\u2013gel method, characterized and tested for the total oxidation of butanol. The catalytic results were mainly explained by the textural (SSA and crystallite size), and bulk/surface properties (oxygen mobility and Mn4+ concentration). The presence of both Ce4+/Ce3+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples led to excellent catalytic activity for n-butanol complete oxidation with an activity maximum for x =0.36. The flavors and fragrances industry recorded total sales of over US$ 18 billion in 2006. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is evaluated in relation to the Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 solid solutions, which serve as catalysts for the total oxidation of butanol. The study highlights the catalytic performance of these solid solutions, particularly at a specific composition (x = 0.36), achieving a high conversion rate of 90% for butan-1-ol at 175\u00b0C. The relationship is significant as the solid solution's properties directly influence the catalytic activity for butanol oxidation.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a strong connection between butan-1-ol and the solid solution, as the catalytic activity for butanol oxidation is directly linked to the properties of the solid solution. The context provides evidence of their interaction through quantitative catalytic performance data.",
        "score": 4
