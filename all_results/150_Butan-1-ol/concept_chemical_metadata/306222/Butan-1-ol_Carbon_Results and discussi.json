    "context": "But with further Mn content increase, the concentration of Ce4+ decreases (Table 2). This result can be explained by an electrons transfer from Mn to Ce, since in parallel, Mn4+ concentration increases. In Mn\u2013Ce\u2013O composites, Chen et al. suggested an electron transfer but from Ce to Mn since addition of manganese to cerium increased the abundance of surface Ce4+ species. The single carbon-containing product of butanol oxidation is CO2 at high conversion levels. Butanal is the major intermediate product in the course of butanol oxidation towards CO2, other aldehydes such as propanal and ethanal are detected but in negligible concentrations. Fig. 5A presents the conversion of butanol to butanal over Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 catalysts. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is discussed in relation to its oxidation process, where it is converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) as the primary product. The oxidation of butan-1-ol involves the formation of butanal as a significant intermediate, indicating a direct chemical transformation that ultimately leads to the release of carbon in the form of CO2. This highlights the relationship between butan-1-ol and carbon, as the oxidation process results in carbon being released as a product.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butan-1-ol and carbon, as the oxidation of butan-1-ol directly produces carbon dioxide. The context provides evidence of this transformation, indicating a clear relationship within the biochemical process of oxidation.",
