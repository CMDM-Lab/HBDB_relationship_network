    "context": "It is well known that alcohol catalytic oxidation provides reaction intermediates such as aldehydes, ketons and acetic acids. The major path appears to be the direct oxidation of butanal to CO2; its oxidation via the acid is expected to be a minor path, because (1) no butanoic acid is detected and (2) CO2 starts to be produced when the butanal concentration decreases. The same reaction scheme \u201cbutanol\u2192butanal\u2192CO2\u201d has already been observed during the homogeneous oxidation of 150ppm of butanol in air. The homogeneous conversion of butanol to butanal is maximized at around 260\u00b0C whereas the maximum is lowered to 125\u00b0C in the presence of Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 solid solutions. Fig. 5B shows the butanol conversion over Zr0.4Ce0.6\u2212x Mn x O2 catalysts as a function of reaction temperature. ",

        "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol and butyraldehyde are related through the catalytic oxidation process where butan-1-ol is oxidized to form butyraldehyde (butanal) as an intermediate. The reaction scheme indicates that butan-1-ol undergoes conversion to butanal, which is then further oxidized to CO2. This highlights a direct chemical transformation between the two compounds during the oxidation process.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between butan-1-ol and butyraldehyde, as the context describes a clear reaction pathway where butan-1-ol is converted to butyraldehyde during oxidation, supported by experimental observations.",
        "score": 4
