    "context": "But the interactions between MnO x and CeO2 vary with the composition and the optimum Mn/Ce ratio depends on (i) the catalyst synthesis method and (ii) the nature of the pollutant to be destroyed. Besides it is well known that formation of mixed oxides of ceria with Zr4+ enhanced oxygen storage properties of ceria and the so-formed mixed oxides exhibited good thermal stability. Butanol enters the environment from either natural sources or during its production, transport, storage and use as a chemical intermediate and a solvent. The primary route for entering the environment is the release to the atmosphere when used as a solvent for paints, coatings, varnishes, resins, gums, vegetable oils, etc. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-butanol is produced or used. n-Butanol is not classifiable as to human and animal carcinogenicity. However a 10 year study, conducted of men exposed to this compound (>200ppm of n-butanol) in an industrial setting, revealed ocular symptoms included a burning sensation, blurring of vision, lachrymation, and photophobia. Animal exposed to n-butanol in air may manifest ataxia, central nervous system depression, prostration. ",

        "summary": "In this context, Butan-1-ol is discussed in relation to occupational exposure, particularly through dermal contact in workplaces where it is produced or used. The mention of 'dermo-' implies a focus on skin exposure and its potential effects, such as ocular symptoms and central nervous system depression, indicating a direct relevance to health risks associated with Butan-1-ol exposure.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between Butan-1-ol and dermal exposure, as the context discusses the health implications of skin contact with this compound in occupational settings, supported by evidence of symptoms resulting from such exposure.",
        "score": 4
