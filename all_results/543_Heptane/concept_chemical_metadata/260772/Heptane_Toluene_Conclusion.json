    "context": "Motor vehicle fuels contain hundreds of VOCs and can differ widely in composition. This study characterized VOCs in four current and commercially available fuels. Conventional gasoline showed liquid and vapor compositions that were comparable to earlier reports. The dominant VOCs in gasoline and E85 included aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, p-m-xylene) and alkanes (n-heptane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane). Headspace vapors were \u201cenriched\u201d in the fuel\u2019s more volatile components (e.g., benzene, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and n-heptane). In ULSD and B20, for which little VOC information is available, the dominant VOCs included alkanes and several aromatics (e.g., 1,2,3-trimethyl benzene and naphthalene). Vapors of these fuels contained toluene, p-,m-xylene and benzene at concentrations much lower than gasoline\u2019s. ",

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in various motor vehicle fuels. Heptane is categorized as an alkane, while toluene is an aromatic compound. They are mentioned together in the analysis of fuel compositions, indicating their coexistence in gasoline and other fuel types, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as heptane and toluene are both part of the VOCs in fuel compositions, sharing a general category but lacking detailed discussion of their interactions or specific roles within the context.",
        "score": 2
