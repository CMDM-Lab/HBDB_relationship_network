    "context": "In comparison to the literature just described, we found toluene, ethylbenzene, and p-m-xylene at levels 3 to 6 times lower; cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane and n-heptane levels were similar to the Californian reformulated gasoline (which was relatively high); and a higher naphthalene concentration. The comparison fuels were relatively old (1989\u20132003), and compositional differences likely reflect the lower levels of aromatic compounds found in the newer reformulated gasoline. While this analysis shows that VOC compositions can vary widely, the target compounds in this study are commonly found in fuels, and concentrations of at least some VOCs appear to be representative of current US fuels. For example, the benzene concentration in the test gasoline, 6140mgL\u22121 (Table 1) or 0.96% by volume, reflects the current national average for gasoline production from US refineries, which is expected to fall from 1.05vol.% in 2007 to 0.62vol.% in 2015 (US EPA, 2010).Composition of E85 In E85, 27 target VOCs were detected, and p-, m-xylene, toluene, n-heptane, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and o-xylene were the top compounds, accounting for 59% of the TTVOCs (Table 1). TTVOC comprised 4.5% of the weight of E85, or 29.6% of the VOCs excluding ethanol. Given that E85 is an 85% bioethanol/15% gasoline blend, the VOC composition was expected to resemble that of gasoline, but with VOC concentrations (other than ethanol) approximately 85% lower. While both E85 and gasoline contained the same compounds, VOC abundances differed considerably (Table 1): In E85, the TTVOC concentration was 31% of gasoline\u2019s (rather than the expected 15%); ethylbenzene, p-,m-xylene, o-xylene, n-octane and n-nonane had higher fractions (>50%), while n-tetradecane, cyclohexane, and methyl cyclohexane had lower fractions (<10%).

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in fuel compositions, specifically in the analysis of E85 and gasoline. However, their relationship is not explicitly detailed beyond their presence in the same category of compounds. The study focuses on the overall VOC composition rather than specific interactions or comparisons between heptane and 3-xylene.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as heptane and 3-xylene are both identified as VOCs in fuel but lack a direct or significant relationship in the context provided. They are mentioned together without further exploration of their interactions.",
