    "context": "This study characterized VOCs in four current and commercially available fuels. Conventional gasoline showed liquid and vapor compositions that were comparable to earlier reports. The dominant VOCs in gasoline and E85 included aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, p-m-xylene) and alkanes (n-heptane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane). Headspace vapors were \u201cenriched\u201d in the fuel\u2019s more volatile components (e.g., benzene, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and n-heptane). In ULSD and B20, for which little VOC information is available, the dominant VOCs included alkanes and several aromatics (e.g., 1,2,3-trimethyl benzene and naphthalene). Vapors of these fuels contained toluene, p-,m-xylene and benzene at concentrations much lower than gasoline\u2019s. Depending on temperature, E85 vapor had higher concentrations of several or many VOCs than gasoline, and vapor pressures of the 17 measured VOCs in E85 increased considerably faster with temperature than those in gasoline.

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and cyclohexane are both identified as dominant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in conventional gasoline and E85 fuels. They are categorized as alkanes, indicating they share a similar chemical structure and classification. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between heptane and cyclohexane beyond their presence in the same fuel compositions.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as heptane and cyclohexane are mentioned together as components of fuel but lack detailed discussion of their interactions or specific roles within the context.",
