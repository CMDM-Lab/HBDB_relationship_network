    "context": "1996 Vancouver, Canada gasoline, toluene, 2-methylbutane, p-,m-xylene, n-pentane and 2-methyl pentane were the top five compounds, accounting for 34% of NMHC (McLaren et al., 1996). In Washington State, US gasoline from the same period, toluene, 2-methylbutane, p-,m-xylene, n-pentane and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane were the top five compounds, accounting for 33% of NMHC (McLaren et al., 1996). In a 2003 study, the top five compounds in South Korea gasoline were 2-methylbutane, toluene, 2-methylpentane, n-pentane and p-,m-xylene, accounting for 42% (wt) (Na et al., 2004). In comparison to the literature just described, we found toluene, ethylbenzene, and p-m-xylene at levels 3 to 6 times lower; cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane and n-heptane levels were similar to the Californian reformulated gasoline (which was relatively high); and a higher naphthalene concentration. The comparison fuels were relatively old (1989\u20132003), and compositional differences likely reflect the lower levels of aromatic compounds found in the newer reformulated gasoline. While this analysis shows that VOC compositions can vary widely, the target compounds in this study are commonly found in fuels, and concentrations of at least some VOCs appear to be representative of current US fuels. For example, the benzene concentration in the test gasoline, 6140mgL\u22121 (Table 1) or 0.96% by volume, reflects the current national average for gasoline production from US refineries, which is expected to fall from 1.05vol.% in 2007 to 0.62vol.% in 2015 (US EPA, 2010).Composition of E85 In E85, 27 target VOCs were detected, and p-, m-xylene, toluene, n-heptane, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and o-xylene were the top compounds, accounting for 59% of the TTVOCs (Table 1).

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and naphthalene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in gasoline and E85 fuel compositions. While heptane is noted for its similar levels to Californian reformulated gasoline, naphthalene is highlighted for having a higher concentration compared to older fuel samples. However, there is no direct interaction or specific functional relationship discussed between heptane and naphthalene beyond their presence in fuel mixtures.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as heptane and naphthalene are both identified as VOCs in fuel compositions, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating only a general connection without detailed interaction.",
