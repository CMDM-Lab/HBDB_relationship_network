    "context": "Headspace concentrations of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and toluene were also higher than the 15% expected (18\u201333% at 5\u00b0C, 28\u201340% at 40\u00b0C). Only the benzene concentration was close to 15% (15% at 5\u00b0C, 20% at 40\u00b0C). As seen for gasoline, several of the most prevalent VOCs in liquid E85 had low relatively vapor concentrations, e.g., 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-ethyl toluene.Vapor composition of ULSD and B20 B20 and ULSD had similar VOC headspace compositions (Table 2). The top five target VOCs were cycloalkanes (methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane) and alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-heptane), which together accounted for 63\u201376% of TTVOC (depending on temperature). The most abundant aromatics were toluene (7% of TTVOC), p-,m-xylene (3\u20136%), and benzene (2\u20134%). ULSD had slightly higher TTVOC headspace concentrations (0.99\u20136.16gm\u22123 at temperatures of 5 and 40\u00b0C, respectively) than ULSD (0.81\u20135.80gm\u22123). Concentrations of most VOCs in the two fuels were similar (within 20%) at each temperature, although B20 showed higher concentrations of n-octane, ethyl benzene, n-nonane, 4-ethyl toluene at 5\u00b0C and n-tridecane and n-tetradecane at 40\u00b0C, but lower concentrations of cyclohexane.

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and cycloparaffins are both mentioned as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in fuel compositions, specifically in the headspace of liquid E85 and ULSD. Heptane is categorized as an alkane, while cycloparaffins include compounds like cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. They are grouped together in the analysis of VOCs, indicating a shared relevance in the study of fuel emissions, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between heptane and cycloparaffins is detailed.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as heptane and cycloparaffins are both identified as components of VOCs in fuel but lack a direct functional or chemical relationship in the context provided.",
        "score": 2
