    "context": "Headspace concentrations of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and toluene were also higher than the 15% expected (18\u201333% at 5\u00b0C, 28\u201340% at 40\u00b0C). Only the benzene concentration was close to 15% (15% at 5\u00b0C, 20% at 40\u00b0C). As seen for gasoline, several of the most prevalent VOCs in liquid E85 had low relatively vapor concentrations, e.g., 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-ethyl toluene.Vapor composition of ULSD and B20 B20 and ULSD had similar VOC headspace compositions (Table 2). The top five target VOCs were cycloalkanes (methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane) and alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-heptane), which together accounted for 63\u201376% of TTVOC (depending on temperature). The most abundant aromatics were toluene (7% of TTVOC), p-,m-xylene (3\u20136%), and benzene (2\u20134%). ULSD had slightly higher TTVOC headspace concentrations (0.99\u20136.16gm\u22123 at temperatures of 5 and 40\u00b0C, respectively) than ULSD (0.81\u20135.80gm\u22123). Concentrations of most VOCs in the two fuels were similar (within 20%) at each temperature, although B20 showed higher concentrations of n-octane, ethyl benzene, n-nonane, 4-ethyl toluene at 5\u00b0C and n-tridecane and n-tetradecane at 40\u00b0C, but lower concentrations of cyclohexane.

        "summary": "In this context, Heptane and n-heptane refer to the same chemical compound, as 'n-heptane' is the systematic name for the straight-chain isomer of heptane. The discussion focuses on the vapor composition of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in fuels, where n-heptane is included among other alkanes. Their relationship is direct, as they are essentially synonymous in this chemical context.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a very strong relevance, as Heptane and n-heptane are the same compound, with n-heptane being the IUPAC name for the straight-chain form of heptane. This direct relationship is clearly established in the context of VOCs in fuel compositions.",
        "score": 5
