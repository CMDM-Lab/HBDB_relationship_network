    "context": "Headspace concentrations of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and toluene were also higher than the 15% expected (18\u201333% at 5\u00b0C, 28\u201340% at 40\u00b0C). Only the benzene concentration was close to 15% (15% at 5\u00b0C, 20% at 40\u00b0C). As seen for gasoline, several of the most prevalent VOCs in liquid E85 had low relatively vapor concentrations, e.g., 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-ethyl toluene.Vapor composition of ULSD and B20 B20 and ULSD had similar VOC headspace compositions (Table 2). The top five target VOCs were cycloalkanes (methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane) and alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-heptane), which together accounted for 63\u201376% of TTVOC (depending on temperature). The most abundant aromatics were toluene (7% of TTVOC), p-,m-xylene (3\u20136%), and benzene (2\u20134%). ULSD had slightly higher TTVOC headspace concentrations (0.99\u20136.16gm\u22123 at temperatures of 5 and 40\u00b0C, respectively) than ULSD (0.81\u20135.80gm\u22123). Concentrations of most VOCs in the two fuels were similar (within 20%) at each temperature, although B20 showed higher concentrations of n-octane, ethyl benzene, n-nonane, 4-ethyl toluene at 5\u00b0C and n-tridecane and n-tetradecane at 40\u00b0C, but lower concentrations of cyclohexane.

        "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the alkanes present in the vapor composition of fuels, specifically in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in liquid E85 and ULSD. Alkanes, including heptane, are categorized as saturated hydrocarbons, and their concentrations contribute significantly to the total volatile organic compounds (TTVOC) measured in the study. The relationship is clear as heptane is a specific example of an alkane, highlighting its role within this broader chemical category.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between heptane and alkanes, as heptane is explicitly mentioned as a member of the alkane family in the context of VOC analysis. The context provides quantitative data on its presence, indicating a clear relationship.",
