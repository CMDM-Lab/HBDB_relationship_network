    "context": "Gasoline vapor contains very volatile organic compounds (VVOCs) that were not measured in the present study, e.g., n-butane, isobutane, n-pentane and 2-methylbutane, which collectively accounted for 60\u201377% (wt) as measured in Chicago (Doskey et al., 1992), Atlanta (at 24 and 32\u00b0C) (Conner, 1995) and South Korea (0\u00b0C) (Na et al., 2004). In California reformulated gasoline (with ethanol), 2-methylbutane, 2-methylpentane, ethanol, n-pentane and 2,2-dimethylbutane together accounted for 62% (wt) of the headspace vapor (at 38\u00b0C) (Harley et al., 2000). These studies also show significant variation in vapor concentrations.Vapor composition of E85 The vapor composition of E85 was similar to that of gasoline, although concentrations of the more prevalent VOCs (e.g., cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane toluene) were several times lower (Table 2). For E85, the top five VOCs in headspace vapor were n-heptane (34\u201336%), cyclohexane (13\u201318%), toluene (13\u201314%), methylcyclohexane (8\u201310%) and benzene (8\u20139%), which collectively accounted for 77\u201385% of TTVOC in the headspace, depending on temperature. The TTVOC concentration in E85 vapor was 5.7gm\u22123 at 5\u00b0C or 35% of that of gasoline vapor, and 33gm\u22123 at 40\u00b0C or 52% of gasoline vapor, both well above the 15% expected if the gasoline composition was unchanged. Several VOCs, including n-octane, ethyl benzene, p-, m-,o-xylene and n-nonane, accounted for most of this increase (their concentrations exceeded levels gasoline by a factor of 1.3 to 1.9 at 5\u00b0C, and by 2.4 to 2.9 at 40\u00b0C). Headspace concentrations of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and toluene were also higher than the 15% expected (18\u201333% at 5\u00b0C, 28\u201340% at 40\u00b0C). ",

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the vapor composition of gasoline and E85 fuel. While they are part of the same category of compounds and are analyzed in relation to their concentrations in fuel vapors, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between heptane and toluene beyond their co-occurrence in the vapor samples.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as heptane and toluene are both identified as VOCs in the context of fuel vapor composition, but their relationship is not elaborated upon, indicating only a general connection without detailed interaction.",
        "score": 2
