    "context": "Headspace concentrations of cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and toluene were also higher than the 15% expected (18\u201333% at 5\u00b0C, 28\u201340% at 40\u00b0C). Only the benzene concentration was close to 15% (15% at 5\u00b0C, 20% at 40\u00b0C). As seen for gasoline, several of the most prevalent VOCs in liquid E85 had low relatively vapor concentrations, e.g., 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 4-ethyl toluene.Vapor composition of ULSD and B20 B20 and ULSD had similar VOC headspace compositions (Table 2). The top five target VOCs were cycloalkanes (methylcyclohexane, cyclohexane) and alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-heptane), which together accounted for 63\u201376% of TTVOC (depending on temperature). The most abundant aromatics were toluene (7% of TTVOC), p-,m-xylene (3\u20136%), and benzene (2\u20134%). ULSD had slightly higher TTVOC headspace concentrations (0.99\u20136.16gm\u22123 at temperatures of 5 and 40\u00b0C, respectively) than ULSD (0.81\u20135.80gm\u22123). Concentrations of most VOCs in the two fuels were similar (within 20%) at each temperature, although B20 showed higher concentrations of n-octane, ethyl benzene, n-nonane, 4-ethyl toluene at 5\u00b0C and n-tridecane and n-tetradecane at 40\u00b0C, but lower concentrations of cyclohexane.

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and cyclohexane are both identified as significant components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in fuel mixtures, specifically in the headspace of liquid E85 and ULSD. They are categorized together as cycloalkanes and alkanes, contributing to the total volatile organic compound (TTVOC) composition. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between heptane and cyclohexane beyond their classification as components of VOCs in fuel.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low to moderate relevance, as heptane and cyclohexane are mentioned together in the context of VOCs in fuel mixtures, indicating they share a general category but lack detailed discussion of their specific interactions or significance.",
