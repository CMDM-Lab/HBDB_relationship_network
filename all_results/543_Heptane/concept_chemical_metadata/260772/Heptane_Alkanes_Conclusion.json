    "context": "Motor vehicle fuels contain hundreds of VOCs and can differ widely in composition. This study characterized VOCs in four current and commercially available fuels. Conventional gasoline showed liquid and vapor compositions that were comparable to earlier reports. The dominant VOCs in gasoline and E85 included aromatic compounds (e.g., toluene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, p-m-xylene) and alkanes (n-heptane, cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane). Headspace vapors were \u201cenriched\u201d in the fuel\u2019s more volatile components (e.g., benzene, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and n-heptane). In ULSD and B20, for which little VOC information is available, the dominant VOCs included alkanes and several aromatics (e.g., 1,2,3-trimethyl benzene and naphthalene). Vapors of these fuels contained toluene, p-,m-xylene and benzene at concentrations much lower than gasoline\u2019s. ",

        "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as a specific type of alkane present in motor vehicle fuels, particularly in gasoline and other fuel compositions. The study highlights that alkanes, including n-heptane, are dominant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in these fuels. This establishes a clear categorization of heptane as a member of the broader alkane family, emphasizing its relevance in the analysis of fuel compositions.",
        "reason": "The score of 5 reflects a direct and strong relationship between heptane and alkanes, as heptane is explicitly mentioned as an alkane in the context of fuel composition analysis, indicating a critical connection.",
        "score": 5
