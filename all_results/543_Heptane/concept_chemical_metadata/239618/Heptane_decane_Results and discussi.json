    "context": "Figs. 5 and 6 show the comparison of the results obtained for breath sample analysis by OF sensor and GC\u2013MS method. The analysis of the results reported in these figures suggests that: (a) a linear correlation can be established between the two analytical methodologies for the eight volatile compounds analyzed, with correlation coefficients (R 2) of 0.9997 (p <3.11\u00d710\u221233) for ethane, 0.9998 (p <7.13\u00d710\u221235) for pentane, 0.9925 (p <1.40\u00d710\u221220) for heptane, 0.9988 (p <8.26\u00d710\u221228) for octane, 0.9999 (p <5.91\u00d710\u221236) for decane, 0.9995 (p <6.74\u00d710\u221231) for benzene, 0.9991 (p <1.05\u00d710\u221228) for toluene, and 0.9981 (p <5.50\u00d710\u221226) for styrene; (b) for all evaluated analytes in the exhaled air, the regression line has not significantly different intercept of zero and a not significantly different slope of 1, supporting the hypothesis that the results obtained with the two analytical method cannot be statistically differentiated; (c) narrow intervals at 95% confidence level were observed, which suggest a low dispersion levels of the results obtained by the two applied analytical methodologies on breath analysis. The comparison of the results obtained for volatile compounds analysis in breath samples, by the OF device and GC\u2013MS, showed that the difference in the mean values between the two analytical methodologies is not great enough to exclude the possibility that the difference is due to random sampling variability; there is not a statistically significant difference (p =0.903, 0.984, 0.914, 0.797, 0.977, 0.715, 0.797 and 0.756 for ethane, pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene, respectively) between the two analytical systems implemented for breath analysis. This particular statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.0, applying a t-test on ethane, pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene results. In order to ascertain the applicability of the developed OF device for breath analysis and its usefulness in clinical context, the potential interference of 2-propanol in the breath analysis was evaluated. This compound is widely use as a disinfectant, i.e., for disinfection of large skin areas of patients. No interference could be found since the 2-propanol produces a peak in a different time window of the target analytes; as a consequence, it is also possible to infer that the OF sensor could be also applied to breath analysis under clinical conditions.

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and decane are both mentioned as volatile compounds analyzed in breath samples using two different analytical methodologies: OF sensor and GC\u2013MS. The results indicate a strong linear correlation between the two methods for various volatile compounds, including heptane and decane, suggesting that both compounds can be reliably measured and compared in breath analysis. However, there is no specific discussion of their individual biological or chemical interactions beyond their inclusion in the same analytical study.",
        "reason": "The score of 3 reflects a moderate relevance, as heptane and decane are both part of the same analytical study, showing a correlation in measurement methods. However, their relationship is not deeply explored beyond their presence in the analysis.",
