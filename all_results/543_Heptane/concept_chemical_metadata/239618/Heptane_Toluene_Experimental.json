    "context": "Additionally, the operational conditions of links, o-rings, seals and septa were also verified and appropriately replaced when necessary. The sampling bulb was previously purged with pure N2 (99.999%, Praxair, Portugal) in order to reduce ambient air contamination, guaranteeing an airtight collecting system, free from chemicals and microorganisms from the ambient air.Chemicals and standard mixtures preparation The standards used for calibration experiments were prepared in carbon disulfide, from Sigma and Fluka chemicals, with a purity of at least 98%. Stock solutions of pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene, respectively, were prepared in 50.0mL volumetric flasks. Five standards were then prepared by taking appropriate aliquots of the stock solutions and serially diluting them with carbon disulfide in 25.0mL volumetric flasks. The solutions were mixed in an ultrasonic bath for 15min and refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. For analysis, 5\u03bcL aliquots of the solutions were injected into the sampling bulb, using a microsyringe (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). ",

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and toluene are both mentioned as components of standard mixtures prepared for calibration experiments in a chemical analysis setup. They are included in a list of stock solutions alongside other hydrocarbons, indicating their use in analytical procedures. However, there is no discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships within the context provided.",
        "reason": "The score of 2 reflects a low relevance, as heptane and toluene are simply listed together as part of standard mixtures for calibration, without any detailed discussion of their chemical interactions or significance in the analysis.",
