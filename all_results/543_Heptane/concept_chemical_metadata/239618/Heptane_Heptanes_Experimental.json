    "context": "Additionally, the operational conditions of links, o-rings, seals and septa were also verified and appropriately replaced when necessary. The sampling bulb was previously purged with pure N2 (99.999%, Praxair, Portugal) in order to reduce ambient air contamination, guaranteeing an airtight collecting system, free from chemicals and microorganisms from the ambient air.Chemicals and standard mixtures preparation The standards used for calibration experiments were prepared in carbon disulfide, from Sigma and Fluka chemicals, with a purity of at least 98%. Stock solutions of pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene, respectively, were prepared in 50.0mL volumetric flasks. Five standards were then prepared by taking appropriate aliquots of the stock solutions and serially diluting them with carbon disulfide in 25.0mL volumetric flasks. The solutions were mixed in an ultrasonic bath for 15min and refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. For analysis, 5\u03bcL aliquots of the solutions were injected into the sampling bulb, using a microsyringe (Hamilton, Bonaduz, Switzerland). ",

        "summary": "In this context, heptane and heptanes are mentioned as part of a list of chemicals used to prepare standard mixtures for calibration experiments. They are both aliphatic hydrocarbons, but the text does not provide any specific interaction or functional relationship between them. Their mention is purely coincidental as part of a broader chemical analysis setup.",
        "reason": "The score of 1 reflects a very low relationship, as heptane and heptanes are simply listed among other chemicals without any discussion of their interaction or relevance to each other in the context provided.",
