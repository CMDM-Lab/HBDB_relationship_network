    "context": "In the breath samples analyzed, the levels of the exhaled target compounds correlate to those already reported for these compounds in healthy subject's breath, from a comparison to the range of concentration shown in Table 2 . Table 2 also shows a list of the biomarkers analyzed, their related diseases, and metabolic disorders. Figs. 5 and 6 show the comparison of the results obtained for breath sample analysis by OF sensor and GC\u2013MS method. The analysis of the results reported in these figures suggests that: (a) a linear correlation can be established between the two analytical methodologies for the eight volatile compounds analyzed, with correlation coefficients (R 2) of 0.9997 (p <3.11\u00d710\u221233) for ethane, 0.9998 (p <7.13\u00d710\u221235) for pentane, 0.9925 (p <1.40\u00d710\u221220) for heptane, 0.9988 (p <8.26\u00d710\u221228) for octane, 0.9999 (p <5.91\u00d710\u221236) for decane, 0.9995 (p <6.74\u00d710\u221231) for benzene, 0.9991 (p <1.05\u00d710\u221228) for toluene, and 0.9981 (p <5.50\u00d710\u221226) for styrene; (b) for all evaluated analytes in the exhaled air, the regression line has not significantly different intercept of zero and a not significantly different slope of 1, supporting the hypothesis that the results obtained with the two analytical method cannot be statistically differentiated; (c) narrow intervals at 95% confidence level were observed, which suggest a low dispersion levels of the results obtained by the two applied analytical methodologies on breath analysis. The comparison of the results obtained for volatile compounds analysis in breath samples, by the OF device and GC\u2013MS, showed that the difference in the mean values between the two analytical methodologies is not great enough to exclude the possibility that the difference is due to random sampling variability; there is not a statistically significant difference (p =0.903, 0.984, 0.914, 0.797, 0.977, 0.715, 0.797 and 0.756 for ethane, pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene, respectively) between the two analytical systems implemented for breath analysis. This particular statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.0, applying a t-test on ethane, pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene results. In order to ascertain the applicability of the developed OF device for breath analysis and its usefulness in clinical context, the potential interference of 2-propanol in the breath analysis was evaluated.

        "summary": "In this context, heptane is analyzed as one of the volatile compounds present in breath samples. The study establishes a strong correlation between the levels of heptane in exhaled air and those reported in healthy subjects, indicating that breath analysis can effectively measure heptane concentrations. The statistical analysis supports the reliability of the results obtained through different analytical methodologies for breath analysis, highlighting the relevance of heptane in the context of exhalation and potential biomarkers for metabolic disorders.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between heptane and exhalation, as the study provides quantitative data showing a strong correlation in breath analysis. Heptane is part of the volatile compounds being measured, indicating its relevance in the context of exhaled biomarkers.",
