    "context": "Breath analysis has also been conducted by using electrical sensors of small scale instrumentation; however, they have intrinsic low detection selectivity and require frequent calibrations [22\u201324]. Optical-chemical sensors have notability experienced high analytical interest and successful applications [25\u201334]; this type of device displays several analytical advantages over other sensing methods, such as unmatched sensitivity, remote measuring capabilities via optical fibers, non-invasiveness and multi-analyte detection of chemical, biological and clinical relevance. The use of optical fiber in sensor systems seems to be a highly competitive technique for a wide range of application, including breath analysis, as highlighted by Wolfbeis et al. in the development of an OF-based fluorescence sensor for narcotic halothane determination in the presence of oxygen; Mills et al. for breath-by-breath carbon dioxide analysis using an OF sensor; DuBois et al. in a study regarding the development of an OF sensor for ammonia detection in the breath of non-healthy subjects and the evaluation of the correlation of breath and arterial ammonia levels; and Mitsubayashi et al. in an optical bio-sniffer for methyl mercaptan in halitosis. This work aimed to develop an optical fiber (OF) sensor for real-time analysis of exhaled volatile organic compounds, such as ethane, pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene, which are breath biomarkers for a number of metabolic disorders, i.e., vitamin E deficiency, lipid peroxidation, lung cancer, oxidative stress, airway inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis. To meet this goal, the analytical potential of the OF device for fast, accurate, reliable and simple non-invasive breath monitoring, and its application for clinical diagnosis were assessed. Analysis design and subjects The design of the reported study included the measurement of eight selected VOCs (ethane, pentane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and styrene) in air exhaled by 20 healthy subjects (10 females and 10 males). Before breath collection, the healthy volunteer subjects had filled in a questionnaire regarding professional activity and personal habits, among other topics. ",

        "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can serve as a breath biomarker for various metabolic disorders, including vitamin E deficiency. The study emphasizes the potential of optical fiber sensors for real-time analysis of these VOCs, suggesting a link between heptane levels in breath and the metabolic state associated with vitamin E deficiency, which is related to lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.",
        "reason": "The score of 4 reflects a significant connection between heptane and vitamin E deficiency, as heptane is mentioned as a biomarker for this condition. The context provides evidence of heptane's relevance in the analysis of metabolic disorders, indicating a clear relationship.",
