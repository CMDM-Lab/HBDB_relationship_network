The mention of 'orthologous gene' refers to the absence of the 2B enzyme in monkey microsomes, indicating a comparative analysis of metabolic functions across species. However, the relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and orthologous genes is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on enzyme activity rather than a direct connection to gene orthology.",
