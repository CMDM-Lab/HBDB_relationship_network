The increase in isoprene is associated with hypercholesterolemia and proteinuria in CKD models, suggesting a metabolic connection between isoprene production and renal dysfunction. The findings indicate that isoprene levels may serve as a biomarker for renal health status, particularly in ESRF patients undergoing hemodialysis.",
