The study suggests that the increase in 8-isoprostane levels may be linked to episodes of oxygen desaturation caused by airway obstruction during sleep. The findings indicate that the oxidative stress associated with OSA is potentially driven by the mechanical obstruction and subsequent hypoxic events, highlighting a significant relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and obstruction.",
