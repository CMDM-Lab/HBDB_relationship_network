The study highlights the potential of using breath analysis to distinguish between asthmatic and control populations, suggesting that decane, along with other compounds, may be linked to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma. This indicates a significant relationship between decane and asthma, as it contributes to the identification of asthmatic conditions through breath analysis.",

The evolution of the child's condition is tracked through changes in the levels of these compounds, suggesting that the decrease in decane levels may reflect a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress associated with asthma. This indicates a potential relationship between the metabolic changes of decane and the evolution of the child's health status over the treatment period.",
