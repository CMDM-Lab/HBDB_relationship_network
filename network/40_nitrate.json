Approximately 75% of ingested nitrate is excreted via the kidneys, while the remainder is converted to nitrite by oral bacteria. This nitrite can then be further reduced to nitric oxide (NO) in various body systems. The study highlights the rapid increase in salivary and plasma nitrate levels following ingestion, peaking at 90-120 minutes, indicating a direct relationship between nitrate ingestion and its physiological effects.",
