    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is evaluated within a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSPR) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling framework to predict its inhalation pharmacokinetics. The model utilizes molecular fragment information and exposure parameters to simulate the drug kinetics of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, indicating a direct relationship between the compound's structure and its pharmacokinetic behavior in biological systems."
