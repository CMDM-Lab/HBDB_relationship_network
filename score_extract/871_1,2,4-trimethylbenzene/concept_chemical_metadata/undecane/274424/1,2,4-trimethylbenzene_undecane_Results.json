    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit significant associations with asthma. The study reports non-linear significant associations for both compounds, indicating that higher concentrations of these VOCs are linked to increased asthma risk. The statistical significance of their associations suggests a potential relationship in the context of respiratory health, particularly concerning asthma prevalence."
