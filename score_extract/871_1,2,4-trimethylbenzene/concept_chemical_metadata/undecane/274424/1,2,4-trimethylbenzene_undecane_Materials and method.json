    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and undecane are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are included in the analysis of air pollutants within dwellings. They are part of distinct groups of VOCs, with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene classified as an aromatic hydrocarbon and undecane as an aliphatic hydrocarbon. However, the context does not provide any specific interaction or relationship between the two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs and their inclusion in the overall VOC score analysis."
