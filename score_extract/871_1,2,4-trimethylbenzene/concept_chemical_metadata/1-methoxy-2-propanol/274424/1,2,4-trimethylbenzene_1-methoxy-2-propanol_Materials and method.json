    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 1-methoxy-2-propanol are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to the global VOC score, which quantifies air pollutants in dwellings. They are included in separate classifications of VOCs: 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene as an aromatic hydrocarbon and 1-methoxy-2-propanol as a glycol ether. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between these two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs."
