    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is categorized as an aromatic hydrocarbon among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), while aldehydes are listed as a separate category of VOCs. Both are included in a broader analysis of air pollutants and their associations with health indices. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and aldehydes, indicating they are simply part of a larger classification of VOCs without further elaboration on their interrelation."
