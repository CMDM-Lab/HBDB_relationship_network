    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their degradation kinetics. However, the text primarily focuses on the kinetic parameters of other compounds, with no direct comparison or interaction between the two compounds discussed. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than any specific relationship or functional interaction."
