    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and n-dodecane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose concentrations decreased after injection into sterile sand. The decrease in their concentrations was noted to occur in an erratic manner, suggesting processes like condensation and sorption. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the study."
