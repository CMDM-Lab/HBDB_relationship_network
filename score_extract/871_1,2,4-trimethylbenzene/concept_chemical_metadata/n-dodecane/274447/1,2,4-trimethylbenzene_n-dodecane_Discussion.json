    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and n-dodecane are both mentioned as compounds with high boiling points that posed analytical challenges during experiments involving vapor concentrations. The study highlights issues related to the condensation of these vapors in sampling equipment, indicating that their physical properties may affect experimental outcomes. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their shared analytical difficulties."
