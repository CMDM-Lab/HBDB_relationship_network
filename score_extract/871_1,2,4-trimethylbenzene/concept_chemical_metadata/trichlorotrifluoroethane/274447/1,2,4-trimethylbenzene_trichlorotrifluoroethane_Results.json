    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and trichlorotrifluoroethane are mentioned among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their degradation activity. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between these two compounds. The focus is primarily on the kinetic parameters of other VOCs, with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene noted for first-order kinetics, while trichlorotrifluoroethane is included in a list of compounds without specific degradation data."
