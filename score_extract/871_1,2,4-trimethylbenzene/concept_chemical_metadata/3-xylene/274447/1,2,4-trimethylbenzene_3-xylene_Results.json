    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in a study of vapor profiles and their transport behavior. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between these two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs. Their presence in the study is more about their individual profiles rather than a comparative or functional relationship."
