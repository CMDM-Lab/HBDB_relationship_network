    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and n-butoxyethanol are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to the global VOC score, which quantifies air pollutants in dwellings. They are included in separate classifications of VOCs—1,2,4-trimethylbenzene as an aromatic hydrocarbon and n-butoxyethanol as a glycol ether—indicating they share a commonality as air pollutants but lack a direct interaction or specific relationship within the study."
