    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and dimethyl disulfide are both identified as urinary metabolites whose excretion levels were compared between breast cancer patients and control groups. The study found statistically significant differences in the levels of these metabolites, suggesting they may have relevance as potential biomarkers in cancer diagnosis or monitoring. However, the specific biochemical relationship or interaction between these two compounds is not detailed in the context provided."
