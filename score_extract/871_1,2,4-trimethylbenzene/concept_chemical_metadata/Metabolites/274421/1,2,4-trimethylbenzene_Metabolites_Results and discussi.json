    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as one of the urinary metabolites analyzed in a study comparing cancer patients to healthy controls. The study highlights significant differences in the excretion levels of certain metabolites, including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker in distinguishing between these two groups. The analysis indicates that this metabolite, among others, may be relevant in the context of cancer diagnosis or monitoring."
