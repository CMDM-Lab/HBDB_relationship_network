    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and octane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose vapor profiles were analyzed in a study involving reactive transport modeling and biodegradation. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs and their presence in the same experimental setup. Their fluxes were measured, but no comparative analysis or functional relationship is provided."
