    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and decane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high boiling points that posed analytical challenges during experiments. The study highlights issues related to vapor condensation in sampling equipment for these compounds, indicating that their physical properties may affect experimental outcomes. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their shared characteristics as VOCs with high boiling points."
