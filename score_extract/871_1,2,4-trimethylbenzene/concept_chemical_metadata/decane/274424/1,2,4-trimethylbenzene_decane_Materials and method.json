    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and decane are both categorized as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are included in the analysis of air pollutants within dwellings. They are part of distinct groups of VOCs, with 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene classified as an aromatic hydrocarbon and decane as an aliphatic hydrocarbon. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or relationships between these two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs contributing to overall air quality assessments."
