    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is categorized as an aromatic hydrocarbon, while aliphatic hydrocarbons refer to a different class of organic compounds. The mention of both terms occurs within the framework of a global VOC score, which aggregates various types of volatile organic compounds, including both aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and aliphatic hydrocarbons beyond their classification as different types of VOCs."
