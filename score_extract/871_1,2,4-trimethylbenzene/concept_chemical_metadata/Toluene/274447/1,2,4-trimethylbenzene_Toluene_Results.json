    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose vapor profiles were analyzed in a study involving reactive transport modeling and biodegradation. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between these two compounds are not discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of VOC behavior without a direct relationship established between them."
