    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and toluene are both categorized as aromatic hydrocarbons and included in the assessment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in dwellings. They contribute to the global VOC score, which quantifies air pollutants based on their elevated concentrations. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or health implications directly linking these two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs."
