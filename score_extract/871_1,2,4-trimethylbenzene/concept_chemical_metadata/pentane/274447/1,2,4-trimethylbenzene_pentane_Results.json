    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and pentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their degradation activity. However, the text indicates that while 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene exhibited first-order kinetics, pentane showed no degradation activity, suggesting a lack of interaction or significant relationship between the two compounds in terms of metabolic or degradation processes."
