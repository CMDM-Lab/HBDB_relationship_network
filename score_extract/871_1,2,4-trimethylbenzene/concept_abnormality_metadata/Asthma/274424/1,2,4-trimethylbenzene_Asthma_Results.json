    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) significantly associated with asthma. The study reports an odds ratio of 2.10, indicating that exposure to this compound is linked to an increased risk of developing asthma. This suggests a potential role of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene as a contributing factor in asthma pathogenesis, highlighting its relevance in respiratory health assessments."
