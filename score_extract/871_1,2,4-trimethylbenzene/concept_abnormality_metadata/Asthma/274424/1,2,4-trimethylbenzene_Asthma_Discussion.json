    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with an increased risk of asthma in dwellings with high concentrations of VOCs. The study indicates a significant correlation between the presence of this aromatic hydrocarbon and reported cases of asthma, suggesting that exposure to 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene may contribute to respiratory issues in affected populations."
