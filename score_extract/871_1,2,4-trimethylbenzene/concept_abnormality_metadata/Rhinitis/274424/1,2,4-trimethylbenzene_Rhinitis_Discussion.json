    "summary": "In this context, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with an increased risk of rhinitis. The study indicates that higher concentrations of this compound in dwellings correlate with a significant rise in reported cases of rhinitis, suggesting a direct link between exposure to 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and respiratory health issues, particularly rhinitis. This relationship is supported by statistical data showing odds ratios for rhinitis associated with VOC exposure."
