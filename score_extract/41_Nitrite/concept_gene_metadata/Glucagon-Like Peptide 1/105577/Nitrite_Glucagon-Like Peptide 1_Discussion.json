    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) are discussed as significantly correlated changes that predict loss of fat-free mass (FFM) during prolonged hypoxia. Both are suggested to represent compensatory responses aimed at enhancing blood flow and nutrient delivery, indicating a potential integrated role in metabolic adaptations related to muscle health and sarcopenia. Future research is encouraged to explore these mechanisms further, particularly in populations at risk for muscle loss."
