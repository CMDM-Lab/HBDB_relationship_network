    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its release from mechanically ventilated lungs and its correlation with tidal volume. While spastic syndrome is not directly mentioned, the implications of increased nitrite levels may relate to lung function and potential respiratory complications. However, there is no explicit connection made between nitrite and spastic syndrome, limiting the relevance of their relationship."
