    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2−) is discussed in relation to exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and its potential increase due to pulmonary inflammation, particularly in conditions like acute asthma. The study suggests that while EBC NO2− may rise due to airway inflammation, it is not solely determined by inflammatory markers, indicating a complex relationship where mechanical factors may also play a role in nitrite production during acute asthma episodes."
