    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is investigated as a potential biomarker for lung hyperdistention in mechanically ventilated patients. The study suggests that increased levels of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) nitrite correlate with higher tidal volumes, indicating that nitrite may reflect mechanical stress in the lungs during hyperinflation, particularly in conditions like COPD. The findings support the hypothesis that nitrite levels rise with lung distension, linking it to hyperdistention and its physiological implications."
