    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed as a potential biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for assessing pulmonary hyperinflation in COPD patients. The relationship between nitrite levels and hyperdistention is highlighted, suggesting that elevated nitrite may correlate with airway hyperinflation and associated stress in the lungs, which can lead to cellular apoptosis and emphysema. This indicates a significant role for nitrite in monitoring lung conditions related to hyperdistention."
