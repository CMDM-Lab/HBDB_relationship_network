    "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are correlated with static hyperinflation metrics in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study indicates that as hyperdistention increases, so do EBC nitrite levels, particularly in advanced stages of COPD. This suggests a potential link between nitrite levels and the degree of hyperdistention, highlighting the role of nitrite as a biomarker in assessing lung function and inflammation in COPD patients."
