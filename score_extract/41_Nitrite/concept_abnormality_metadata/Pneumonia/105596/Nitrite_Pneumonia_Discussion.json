    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2−) is discussed in relation to its potential increase in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) during conditions like pneumonia, particularly in acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study suggests that elevated EBC NO2− may be linked to pulmonary distension rather than solely to inflammation, indicating a complex relationship where nitrite levels could reflect lung mechanics and injury severity rather than direct inflammatory processes typically associated with pneumonia."
