    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is mentioned as a measurable component in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of a person diagnosed with mild Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study indicates that changes in nitrite levels can be observed during acute inflammation of the upper airways and in COPD, suggesting a potential link between nitrite levels and the inflammatory processes associated with this disease. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its presence in EBC samples."
