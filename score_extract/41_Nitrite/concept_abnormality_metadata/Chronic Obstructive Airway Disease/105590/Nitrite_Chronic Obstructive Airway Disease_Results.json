    "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are analyzed in relation to Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). The study indicates that EBC nitrite levels increase with the severity of static hyperinflation in COPD patients, suggesting a potential biomarker role for nitrite in assessing disease progression. Additionally, inflammatory cytokine levels in EBC differ among patient groups, with COPD patients showing distinct profiles compared to healthy individuals, highlighting the inflammatory aspect of the disease."
