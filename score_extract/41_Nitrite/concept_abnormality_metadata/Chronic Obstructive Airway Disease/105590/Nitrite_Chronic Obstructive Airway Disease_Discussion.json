    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed as a potential diagnostic tool for assessing hyperinflation in patients with Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). The measurement of nitrite in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may aid in monitoring pulmonary function and detecting early signs of lung stress associated with COPD. The relationship suggests that nitrite levels could reflect mechanical stress in the lungs, which is relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of COPD and guiding therapeutic interventions."
