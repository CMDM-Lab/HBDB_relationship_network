    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is investigated as a potential biomarker for mechanical stress in the lungs, particularly in relation to Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). The study hypothesizes that increased levels of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) nitrite correlate with lung distension and hyperinflation, which are characteristic of COPD. The research aims to compare nitrite levels in stable COPD patients with those in healthy volunteers and smokers, linking nitrite accumulation to the pathophysiology of COPD."
