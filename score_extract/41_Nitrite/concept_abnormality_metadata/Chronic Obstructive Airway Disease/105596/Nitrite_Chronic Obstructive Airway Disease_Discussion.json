    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2âˆ’) is discussed as a potential marker of inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD). The study found a significant correlation between nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, suggesting that elevated nitrite may reflect inflammatory processes associated with lung injury in COPD patients. However, the relationship is complex, as other factors influencing nitrite levels were also considered, indicating that while there is a connection, it may not be straightforward."
