    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed as a potential diagnostic tool for assessing hyperinflation in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The measurement of nitrite in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may aid in early diagnosis and monitoring of lung function, particularly in relation to mechanical stress and its implications for lung diseases like emphysema. The relationship highlights nitrite's role in understanding and managing lung conditions."
