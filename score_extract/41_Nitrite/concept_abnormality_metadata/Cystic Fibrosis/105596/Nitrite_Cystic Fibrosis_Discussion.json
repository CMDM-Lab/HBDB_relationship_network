    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2âˆ’) is analyzed as a potential biomarker for nitric oxide production in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The study indicates a strong correlation between nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), suggesting that EBC nitrite measurements may effectively reflect lung inflammation and nitric oxide production in CF patients. This relationship highlights the relevance of nitrite as a noninvasive indicator of pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis."
