    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is identified as a biomarker that may indicate respiratory tract inflammation, with elevated levels found in individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis, among other severe lung conditions. The study suggests that measuring nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) could serve as a potential screening method for monitoring cystic fibrosis and related respiratory diseases, highlighting a significant relationship between nitrite and cystic fibrosis in the context of lung health."
