    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is presented as a marker of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, particularly in relation to hypoxia and its effects on skeletal muscle. The study indicates that during high-altitude acclimatization, levels of nitrite and nitrate increase, reflecting enhanced NO production. This relationship is crucial for understanding how NO metabolism is influenced by oxygen availability and its implications for muscle health and metabolism under stress conditions."
