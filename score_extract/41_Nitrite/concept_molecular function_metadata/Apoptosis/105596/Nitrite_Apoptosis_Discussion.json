    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is linked to apoptosis through its relationship with nitric oxide (NO), which is generated in the lungs and has protective effects against apoptosis in alveolar type II epithelial cells during mechanical overdistension. The study suggests that while nitric oxide can protect cells from apoptosis, it may also contribute to lung damage through nitrosative stress, indicating a complex role of nitrite in cellular processes related to apoptosis."
