    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2−) is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential marker for pulmonary function and inflammation. The study explores the correlation between EBC NO2− and various parameters related to lung injury, including tidal volume (Vt). While significant correlations were found between EBC NO2− normalized to Vt and lung injury severity, the direct relationship between nitrite and inspiration function is not explicitly established, indicating a more complex interaction rather than a straightforward correlation."
