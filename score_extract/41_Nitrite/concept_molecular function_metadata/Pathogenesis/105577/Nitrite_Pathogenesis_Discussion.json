    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is associated with the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, particularly in the setting of hypoxic stress during high-altitude exposure. The study indicates that circulating nitrite concentrations correlate significantly with fat-free mass (FFM) loss, suggesting a potential role of nitrite in the metabolic adaptations and inflammatory responses that may contribute to the development of sarcopenia. However, the exact mechanisms linking nitrite to pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated."
