    "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are analyzed in relation to pulmonary function tests in COPD patients. While EBC nitrite shows significant correlations with residual volume (RV), total lung capacity (TLC), and intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV), it does not correlate with forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). This indicates that nitrite may be more relevant to certain aspects of lung function, particularly those associated with hyperinflation, rather than overall vital capacity."
