    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is mentioned in relation to low airway pH, which favors its protonation. The discussion highlights how low pH conditions, such as those occurring during infections, can enhance the protonation of nitrite and related compounds, potentially influencing their biological activity and protective roles against infections. However, the specific implications of nitrite protonation in this context are not deeply explored."
