    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is identified as a biomarker associated with the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, which is influenced by hypoxic conditions. The study suggests that exposure to hypobaric hypoxia leads to increased nitrite levels, alongside other biomarkers related to oxidative stress and inflammation. This indicates that nitrite may play a mediating role in the physiological responses to hypoxia, particularly concerning skeletal muscle loss and metabolic efficiency, highlighting its potential as a target for nutritional and pharmacological interventions in susceptible populations."
