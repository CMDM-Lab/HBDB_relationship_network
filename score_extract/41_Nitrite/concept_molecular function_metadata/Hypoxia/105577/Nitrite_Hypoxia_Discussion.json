    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and hypoxia are linked through their roles in physiological responses to prolonged low oxygen conditions. The study indicates that changes in nitrite concentrations are significantly correlated with hypoxia and are predictors of fat-free mass (FFM) loss. This suggests that nitrite may play a role in compensatory mechanisms aimed at enhancing blood flow and nutrient delivery during hypoxic conditions, which could impact muscle structure and performance."
