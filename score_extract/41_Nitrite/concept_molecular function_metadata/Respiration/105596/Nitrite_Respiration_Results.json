    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 −) is analyzed in relation to respiratory parameters in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). The study finds a significant correlation between EBC NO2 − levels and ventilatory parameters such as tidal volume (Vt) and expiratory minute volume (EMV), suggesting that nitrite levels may reflect pulmonary function and respiratory status. This indicates a direct relationship between nitrite and respiration, particularly in the context of lung injury."
