    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its permissible levels in commercially sterile and vacuum-packaged Yao-meat. The study indicates that the nitrite concentration in the meat remained below the maximum limit set by Chinese standards, which is crucial for ensuring sterility and safety in food products. While nitrite is a preservative that can inhibit bacterial growth, the relationship to sterility is implied through regulatory limits rather than a direct discussion of their interaction."
