    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is associated with muscle metabolism through its role in the physiological response to hypoxic stress. The study indicates that nitrite concentrations increase during high-altitude exposure, which may enhance muscular efficiency and adapt to increased energetic demands. Additionally, the significant association between circulating nitrite levels and fat-free mass (FFM) loss suggests a potential link between nitrite and muscle metabolism, particularly in the context of hypoxia-induced adaptations."
