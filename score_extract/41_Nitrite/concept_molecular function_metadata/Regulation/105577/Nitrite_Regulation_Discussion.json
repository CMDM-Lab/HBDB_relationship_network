    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is linked to the regulation of metabolic responses under low oxygen conditions. The study highlights how dietary nitrate supplementation leads to increased plasma nitrite concentrations, which correlate with enhanced exercise performance and mitochondrial efficiency. This suggests that nitrite plays a regulatory role in optimizing energy utilization and oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle during hypoxia."
