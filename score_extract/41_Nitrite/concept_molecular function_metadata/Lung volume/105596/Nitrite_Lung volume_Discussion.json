    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 −) is discussed in relation to lung volume (Vt) in patients with varying degrees of lung injury. The study indicates a strong correlation between EBC NO2 − and Vt, suggesting that increased nitrite levels may be associated with mechanical distension of the lungs. This relationship implies that as lung volume decreases due to injury, the EBC NO2 −/Vt ratio increases, reflecting changes in alveolar distension rather than direct inflammation. Thus, nitrite levels may serve as an indirect marker of lung volume and injury severity."
