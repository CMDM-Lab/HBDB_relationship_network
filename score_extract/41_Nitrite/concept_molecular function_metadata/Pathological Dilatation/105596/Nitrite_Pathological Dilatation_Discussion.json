    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is linked to pathological dilatation through its production as a byproduct of nitric oxide in the lungs, particularly in response to alveolar distension. The study suggests that elevated levels of nitrite in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may indicate inappropriate lung distension, which correlates with clinical scores of lung injury. This relationship highlights the potential of nitrite as a marker for monitoring lung conditions associated with mechanical ventilation and lung injury."
