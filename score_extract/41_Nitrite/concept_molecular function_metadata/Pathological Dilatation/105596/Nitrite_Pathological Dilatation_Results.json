    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 −) is investigated for its potential correlation with pulmonary distension and lung injury. The study suggests that while EBC NO2 − may reflect aspects of lung injury, no significant correlation was found between EBC NO2 − and markers of inflammation. The relationship between nitrite and pathological dilatation is implied through the exploration of lung injury severity, but direct evidence linking nitrite levels to pathological dilatation is not established."
