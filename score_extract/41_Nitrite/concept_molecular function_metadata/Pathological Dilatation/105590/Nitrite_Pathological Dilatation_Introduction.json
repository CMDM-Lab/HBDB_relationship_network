    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is investigated as a potential biomarker for lung distension and mechanical stress, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study suggests that increased levels of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) nitrite correlate with lung distension, which may be indicative of pathological dilatation. The findings imply that nitrite could serve as a noninvasive indicator of lung mechanical stress, particularly in conditions characterized by hyperinflation."
