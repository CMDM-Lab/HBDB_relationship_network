    "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels are discussed in relation to mechanical stress on lung cells, particularly in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema. Increased nitrite in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is associated with mechanical overdistension of alveolar cells, which may contribute to pathological dilatation and apoptosis of lung structural cells. This suggests a potential link between elevated nitrite levels and the pathological changes observed in lung conditions characterized by dilatation."
