    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to investigate its potential role as an indicator of pulmonary inflammation or hyperinflation processes. However, the study found no significant correlation between EBC nitrite levels and pulmonary function tests or inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that nitrite may not effectively represent the underlying inflammatory processes in the lungs."
