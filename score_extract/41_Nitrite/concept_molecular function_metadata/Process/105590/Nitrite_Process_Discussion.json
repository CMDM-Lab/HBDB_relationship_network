    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to investigate its relationship with pulmonary function tests and inflammatory cytokines. The study aims to understand the process of nitrite generation in EBC and its potential correlation with airway inflammation in COPD. The choice of measuring nitrite alongside cytokines suggests a shared process in their generation, although no significant correlations were found with pulmonary function tests."
