    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its role in enhancing exercise performance and metabolic responses under hypoxic conditions, which may indirectly influence gastric emptying. The incretin hormone GLP-1, which regulates gastric emptying, is also mentioned, suggesting a potential link between nitrite levels and gastric motility through metabolic pathways. However, the direct relationship between nitrite and gastric emptying is not explicitly detailed."
