    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its measurement in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a product of nitric oxide (NO) conversion. The study highlights that nitrite levels in EBC do not correlate with exhaled NO, suggesting that nitrite may serve as a more reliable biomarker for lung conditions like COPD. The relationship indicates that while both are related to respiratory function, nitrite's presence in EBC provides distinct insights compared to exhaled NO."
