    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is linked to inflammation through its production as a byproduct of nitric oxide in the lungs, particularly in relation to alveolar distension. However, the study indicates that there is no direct correlation between nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and systemic or pulmonary inflammation parameters. Instead, nitrite levels may serve as a marker for lung injury rather than inflammation itself."
