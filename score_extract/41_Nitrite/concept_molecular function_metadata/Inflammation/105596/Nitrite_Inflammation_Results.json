    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (EBC NO2 −) is analyzed in relation to markers of inflammation in patients with varying degrees of lung injury. The study found no significant correlation between EBC NO2 − and pulmonary or systemic markers of inflammation, suggesting that nitrite levels do not reflect inflammatory processes in the studied conditions. Although there are correlations with lung injury parameters, the lack of a direct relationship with inflammation indicates a complex interaction that does not support a straightforward link between nitrite and inflammation."
