    "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) were analyzed to investigate their relationship with pulmonary inflammation, as indicated by cytokine levels. However, the study found no significant correlation between EBC nitrite and inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that nitrite may not serve as an effective indicator of airway inflammation in the studied populations, including healthy individuals and those with COPD."
