    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its biological function, particularly in the context of nitric oxide (NO) release in the lungs. The study highlights the role of nitric oxide in protecting alveolar cells from apoptosis and its potential to induce pulmonary vasodilation. The generation of nitrite (NO2âˆ’) is linked to the mechanical stimuli affecting nitric oxide production, suggesting a significant relationship between nitrite and its biological functions related to nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in lung physiology."
