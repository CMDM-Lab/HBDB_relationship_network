    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its permissible limits in salted meat, specifically Yao-meat. The text mentions that the maximum allowed nitrite concentration is 30 mg/kg according to Chinese standards, and the observed nitrite levels in the meat ranged from 14 to 20 mg/kg over a 35-day period. The relationship is focused on regulatory limits and the observed concentrations of nitrite in the product, indicating a concern for food safety and quality."
