    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is analyzed in relation to pulmonary function tests in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The study finds that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) nitrite concentration correlates with various lung function parameters, particularly in advanced stages of COPD. However, it shows no correlation with forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in the overall COPD patient group, indicating a specific relationship between nitrite levels and certain aspects of lung function rather than a general one."
