    "summary": "In this context, nitrite levels are monitored as part of a study on metabolic and vascular biomarkers during an expedition at high altitude. The data indicates that nitrite levels increased initially but then experienced a significant drop after eight weeks. This fluctuation in nitrite levels is part of a broader analysis of how various biomarkers respond to prolonged hypoxia, highlighting the importance of nitrite in physiological adaptations to altitude."
