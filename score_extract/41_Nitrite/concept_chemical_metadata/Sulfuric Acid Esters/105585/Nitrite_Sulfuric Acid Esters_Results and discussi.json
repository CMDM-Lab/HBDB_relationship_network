    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is measured in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of individuals, particularly noting its elevated levels during acute respiratory infections. However, sulfuric acid esters are not mentioned or discussed in relation to nitrite or the respiratory conditions described. Therefore, there is no direct or indirect relationship established between nitrite and sulfuric acid esters in this context."
