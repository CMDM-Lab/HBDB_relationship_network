    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is discussed in relation to its formation from nitrate under anaerobic conditions, while protons are mentioned in the context of pH indicators that respond to changes in acidity. The relationship between nitrite and protons is indirect, as nitrite concentration can influence the acidity of the environment, which in turn affects the behavior of pH indicators. However, the specific interaction between nitrite and protons is not elaborated upon, making their connection more general than direct."
