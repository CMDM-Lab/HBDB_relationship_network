    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and lactate are both mentioned as components of the ionic content analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using a specific buffer gel electrophoresis (BGE) method. They are categorized as anions present in the samples, but there is no direct discussion of their interaction or functional relationship. The focus is primarily on the optimization of the BGE for separation rather than on the biological significance of nitrite and lactate together."
