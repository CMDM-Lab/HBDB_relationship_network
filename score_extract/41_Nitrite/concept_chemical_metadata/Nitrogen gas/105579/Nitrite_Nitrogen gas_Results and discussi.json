    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrogen gas are related through the biochemical processes involving lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the spoilage of Yao-meat. Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is converted to nitrite and subsequently to nitrogen gas by certain bacteria. This indicates a metabolic pathway where nitrite serves as an intermediate in the reduction process to nitrogen gas, highlighting their interconnected roles in food spoilage and preservation."
