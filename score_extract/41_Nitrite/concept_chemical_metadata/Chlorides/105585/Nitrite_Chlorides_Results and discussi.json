    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and chlorides are both analyzed as anions in the electropherogram of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. While nitrite levels significantly increase during an acute upper respiratory infection, chlorides are also present but not highlighted as having a notable change. The relationship is primarily through their simultaneous measurement in the context of respiratory health, indicating their relevance in assessing respiratory conditions."
