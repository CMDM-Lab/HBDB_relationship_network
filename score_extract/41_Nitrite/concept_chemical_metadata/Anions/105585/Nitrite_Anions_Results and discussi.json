    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is identified as one of the measurable inorganic anions present in the ionic content of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The study focuses on optimizing a background electrolyte (BGE) for the simultaneous separation of various anions, including nitrite, and cations. This indicates that nitrite is categorized as an anion within the analytical framework, but no specific interactions or functional relationships between nitrite and other anions are discussed."
