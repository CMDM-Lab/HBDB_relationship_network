    "summary": "In this context, nitrite is mentioned as one of the measurable anions in the ionic content of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analyzed using a background electrolyte (BGE) that includes 18-crown-6. The 18-crown-6 is utilized to enhance the separation of ions, specifically aiding in distinguishing ammonium ions from potassium ions during the analysis. However, there is no direct interaction or chemical relationship discussed between nitrite and 18-crown-6 beyond their roles in the analytical method."
