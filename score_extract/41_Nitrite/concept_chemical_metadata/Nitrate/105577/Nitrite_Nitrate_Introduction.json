    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrate are discussed as markers of nitric oxide (NO) production, which is influenced by oxygen availability during high-altitude expeditions. The elevation of both nitrite and nitrate levels indicates increased NO metabolism, suggesting a physiological response to hypoxia that may relate to skeletal muscle mobilization and metabolic changes. Their relationship is significant as they both serve as indicators of NO activity and its effects on the body under stress conditions."
