    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrate are discussed in relation to their roles in enhancing muscular energy efficiency under low oxygen conditions. Nitrate supplementation leads to increased exercise performance and reduced oxygen consumption, with significant correlations to post-supplementation plasma nitrite levels. This suggests that nitrite may be a product of nitrate metabolism, indicating a direct relationship where nitrite levels are influenced by nitrate availability and supplementation."
