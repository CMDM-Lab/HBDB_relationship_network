    "summary": "In this context, nitrite (NO2âˆ’) and nitrate are discussed in relation to their presence in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The study highlights a correlation between increased levels of nitrite and nitrate in BALF, suggesting their potential role as biomarkers for lung injury and mortality in ARDS patients. The relationship indicates that both compounds are part of the same biochemical pathway involving nitric oxide and may reflect similar pathological processes in lung damage."
