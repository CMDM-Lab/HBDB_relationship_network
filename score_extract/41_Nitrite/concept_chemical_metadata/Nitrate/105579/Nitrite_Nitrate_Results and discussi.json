    "summary": "In this context, nitrite and nitrate are related through their roles in the storage and preservation of Yao-meat. Initially, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) reduce nitrite concentrations, but as storage progresses, nitrite levels can rise due to the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, facilitated by bacterial contamination and the action of nitrate reductase. This indicates a dynamic relationship where nitrate serves as a precursor to nitrite during meat storage, influenced by microbial activity."
