    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to essential genes involved in its assimilation within a study of insertional mutants. The research identifies essential genes that mediate the positive effects of nitrate, specifically focusing on mutants affected at the NIT2 gene location. This suggests a critical relationship where certain genes are necessary for the effective utilization of nitrate in biological systems."
