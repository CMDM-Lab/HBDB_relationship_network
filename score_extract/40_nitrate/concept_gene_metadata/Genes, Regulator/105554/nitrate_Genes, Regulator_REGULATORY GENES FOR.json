    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to regulatory genes involved in its assimilation in Chlamydomonas. A functional genomics approach was employed to identify these regulatory genes by utilizing an ordered mutant library. The study specifically aimed to disrupt the function of these genes, leading to the identification of essential genes that mediate the positive effects of nitrate, particularly focusing on the NIT2 gene location in the isolated mutants."
