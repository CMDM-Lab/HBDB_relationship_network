    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the genome through the discussion of genes involved in nitrate and nitrite transport, specifically the NRT1, NRT2, and NAR1 gene families. These genes, which are part of the Chlamydomonas genome and other organisms, encode proteins that facilitate the transport of nitrate, indicating a significant genetic basis for nitrate uptake mechanisms across various species, including plants and fungi."
