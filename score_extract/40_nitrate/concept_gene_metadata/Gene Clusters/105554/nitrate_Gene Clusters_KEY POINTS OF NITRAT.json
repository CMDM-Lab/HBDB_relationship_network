    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to gene clusters involved in its assimilation in Chlamydomonas. The text describes the presence of two gene clusters in linkage group IX that contain nitrate assimilation genes, highlighting the regulatory role of the NIT2 gene located in linkage group III. This indicates a direct relationship between nitrate and the genetic mechanisms governing its assimilation."
