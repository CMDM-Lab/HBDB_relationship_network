    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and the NIT2 gene are closely related through their roles in the nitrate assimilation pathway in Chlamydomonas. The NIT2 gene is a positive regulatory locus that influences nitrate and nitrite assimilation, with its expression being repressed in ammonium and induced in nitrogen-free conditions. The presence of nitrate stabilizes NIT2 transcripts, indicating a direct regulatory relationship between nitrate levels and the expression of the NIT2 gene, which is crucial for the organism's nitrogen metabolism."
