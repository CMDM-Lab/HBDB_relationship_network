    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in the regulation of the nitrate assimilation operon in Synechococcus sp. The presence of ammonium inhibits the assimilation of nitrate, affecting the operon's transcriptional activation. This suggests a direct relationship where nitrate acts as a substrate influencing the operon's activity, particularly in the presence of ammonium, which negatively regulates nitrate transport and reduction."
