    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in the metabolic process of cyanobacteria, specifically in its assimilation and reduction to ammonium through the action of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. The genes responsible for this process are organized within the nirA-nrtABCD-narB operon, which is negatively regulated by ammonium. This indicates a direct relationship where the operon controls the expression of genes necessary for nitrate transport and reduction, highlighting the operon's role in nitrate metabolism in cyanobacteria."
