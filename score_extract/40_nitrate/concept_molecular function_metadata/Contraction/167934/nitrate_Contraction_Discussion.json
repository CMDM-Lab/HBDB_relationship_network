    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) is discussed in relation to muscle contraction and performance during exercise. The study suggests that while dietary nitrate may influence ATP demand and mitochondrial coupling, it does not enhance the speed or force of muscle contractions during a single contraction or sustained exercise. The findings indicate that nitrate supplementation did not significantly alter muscle energetics or performance in the subjects tested, highlighting variability in individual responses to nitrate intake."
