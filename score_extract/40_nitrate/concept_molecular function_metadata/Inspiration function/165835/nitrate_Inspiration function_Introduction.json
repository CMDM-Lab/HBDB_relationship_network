    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the enhancement of oxygen delivery and blood flow regulation during exercise, particularly in hypoxic conditions. Nitrate supplementation appears to improve muscle oxygenation and recovery rates, which are critical for maintaining effective inspiration function during physical activity at high altitudes. The evidence suggests that increased nitrate levels may help offset reductions in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, thereby supporting better respiratory and muscular performance under challenging conditions."
