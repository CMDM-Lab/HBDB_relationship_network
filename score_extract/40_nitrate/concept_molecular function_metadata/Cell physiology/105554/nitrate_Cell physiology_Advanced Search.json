    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is highlighted as a preferred nitrogen source for many organisms, including plants, due to its abundance in natural soils. Nitrate assimilation is crucial for cell physiology, as it influences various cellular processes such as root development and stomatal opening. The efficient use of nitrate is essential for growth and productivity, particularly in crop species, linking its assimilation directly to vital physiological functions within cells."
