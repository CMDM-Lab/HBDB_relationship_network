    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and inhibitors are related through the discussion of the inhibitory effect of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) on bacterial nitrate reduction. The study suggests that HBO2 limits the activity of bacterial nitrate- and nitrite-reductases, which are enzymes that facilitate the reduction of nitrate. This inhibition likely contributes to the observed reduction in exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels, indicating a significant interaction between nitrate metabolism and the presence of inhibitors under hyperoxic conditions."
