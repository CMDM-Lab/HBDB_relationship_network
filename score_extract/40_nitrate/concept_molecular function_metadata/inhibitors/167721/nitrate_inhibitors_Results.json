    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and inhibitors are related through the investigation of the effects of hyperoxia on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by oral bacteria. The study indicates that hyperoxia inhibits the bacterial conversion of nitrate to nitrite, suggesting that inhibitors may play a role in this process. However, the specific mechanisms or types of inhibitors involved are not detailed, leaving the relationship somewhat indirect."
