    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its effects on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and muscle performance, particularly in terms of torque and power output during physical activity. However, there is no direct mention or exploration of drug interactions involving nitrate, making the relationship between nitrate and drug interactions unclear and indirect. The focus is primarily on the physiological effects of nitrate rather than its potential interactions with drugs."
