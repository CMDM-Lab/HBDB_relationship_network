    "summary": "In this context, sodium nitrate is evaluated for its physiological effects during hypobaric hypoxia testing, particularly its impact on parameters like PENO and MAP. However, there is no direct discussion of drug interactions related to nitrate. The focus is primarily on nitrate's effects on blood flow and oxygen delivery rather than its interactions with other drugs or substances."
