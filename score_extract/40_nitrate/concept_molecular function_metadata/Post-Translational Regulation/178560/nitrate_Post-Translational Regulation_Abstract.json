    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in the assimilation process in cyanobacteria, which is subject to post-translational regulation. The addition of ammonium inhibits nitrate transport and assimilation, indicating that post-translational mechanisms play a role in regulating nitrate uptake. This suggests a significant interaction where the presence of ammonium affects the post-translational regulation of nitrate transport systems."
