    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to torque through its role in enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, which may influence muscle performance. The study indicates that while there was no significant difference in maximal isometric torque between nitrate and placebo, a tendency for increased peak torque at higher angular velocities was observed with dietary nitrate supplementation. This suggests a potential positive effect of nitrate on muscle torque under specific conditions, particularly at higher velocities."
