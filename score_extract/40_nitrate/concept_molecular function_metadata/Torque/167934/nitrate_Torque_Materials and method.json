    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the assessment of muscle function, specifically through the measurement of torque production during knee extension exercises. The study investigates how dietary nitrate intake affects aerobic exercise performance and muscle contractile function, with torque being a key metric for evaluating muscle strength and power output. However, the direct relationship between nitrate and torque is not explicitly detailed, focusing instead on the broader context of exercise performance."
