    "summary": "In this context, nitrate, derived from beetroot juice, is investigated for its effects on muscle contractile function, specifically focusing on torque during isokinetic dynamometry assessments. The study aims to explore how dietary nitrate intake influences the torque-velocity relationship of human muscle, indicating a direct connection between nitrate consumption and muscle performance metrics."
