    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) is discussed in relation to its conversion to nitric oxide (NO) and its effects on muscle function, particularly in type II muscle fibers during isometric contractions. The study suggests that dietary nitrate intake may enhance torque development at higher angular velocities due to the greater recruitment of type II fibers, which are more responsive to NO. However, the relationship is not fully established as the study did not measure plasma nitrate or nitrite levels, leaving some uncertainty about individual responses to nitrate supplementation."
