    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate assimilation are closely related as the review discusses the process of nitrate assimilation in the green alga Chlamydomonas sp. This organism serves as a model to understand the regulatory mechanisms of nitrate uptake and utilization, which are fundamental for nitrogen metabolism in photosynthetic organisms, including plants. The insights gained from studying Chlamydomonas are expected to enhance our understanding of nitrate assimilation in more complex systems."
