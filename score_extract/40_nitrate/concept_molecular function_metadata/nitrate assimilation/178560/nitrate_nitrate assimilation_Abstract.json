    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate assimilation are closely related as the text discusses the process of nitrate assimilation in cyanobacteria, which is significantly influenced by ammonium levels. Nitrate assimilation involves the transport of nitrate into the cell, a process that is regulated and inhibited by ammonium. This indicates a direct relationship where nitrate is the substrate for assimilation, and its uptake is modulated by ammonium's effects on the transport system."
