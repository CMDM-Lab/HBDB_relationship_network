    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate assimilation are closely related as the study investigates the activities of nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) in response to nitrate-containing media. The expression of these enzymes is crucial for the process of nitrate assimilation, which allows cells to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. The findings indicate that despite variations in NR activity, the overall nitrate utilization and growth rates suggest that nitrate assimilation is effectively occurring in the studied strains."
