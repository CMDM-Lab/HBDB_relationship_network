    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate assimilation are closely related, as the inability of NC2 to assimilate nitrate in the presence of ammonium indicates a regulatory mechanism affecting nitrate assimilation processes. The study highlights how ammonium inhibits both nitrate/nitrite transport and nitrate reduction, thereby negatively regulating the nitrate assimilation operon. This suggests that nitrate assimilation is directly influenced by the presence of ammonium, which affects the cellular mechanisms involved in nitrate utilization."
