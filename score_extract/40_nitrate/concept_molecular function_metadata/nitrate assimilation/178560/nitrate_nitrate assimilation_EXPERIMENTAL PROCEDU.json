    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is a key component of the media used for culturing cells, and its presence is crucial for the induction of nitrate assimilation genes. The transfer of ammonium-grown cells to nitrate-containing media triggers the expression of these genes, indicating a direct relationship where nitrate serves as a substrate for the assimilation process in the studied organisms. This highlights the importance of nitrate in facilitating the metabolic pathway of nitrate assimilation."
