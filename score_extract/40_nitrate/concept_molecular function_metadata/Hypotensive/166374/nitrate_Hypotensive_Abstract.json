    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to hypotensive effects through its conversion to nitric oxide (NO) in the body. Dietary nitrate, particularly from vegetables like spinach, serves as a significant source of NO, which has been shown to lower blood pressure. Human intervention trials indicate that increased dietary nitrate correlates with reduced blood pressure and enhanced blood NO metabolites, highlighting its therapeutic potential in managing hypertension."
