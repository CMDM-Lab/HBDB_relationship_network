    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its potential effects on oxygen transport during exercise at high altitude. The study found that acute nitrate supplementation did not significantly improve forearm blood flow or oxygen saturation (SaO2 and StO2) during exercise, indicating no immediate ergogenic benefit. However, it suggests that nitrate may have a role in enhancing oxygen transport and exercise performance over longer exposures to high altitude, where nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability could be compromised, thus warranting further investigation."
