    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) through a newly discovered pathway involving oral bacteria that reduce nitrate to nitrite, which can then be converted to NO. This highlights the significance of dietary nitrate in enhancing NO synthesis, particularly in conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF), where increased NO levels may be beneficial. The synthesis of NO from nitrate represents an important alternative to the traditional L-arginine pathway, emphasizing the role of dietary sources in NO production."
