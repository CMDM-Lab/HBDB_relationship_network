    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is indirectly related to respiration through its role in the production of nitric oxide (NO) by oral bacteria, which affects exhaled fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) levels. The study suggests that high oxygen tensions from hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment may reduce the nitrate and nitrite reducing activity of oral bacteria, impacting NO levels and potentially influencing respiratory function. The relationship highlights the importance of nitrate in the respiratory process, particularly in the context of NO generation and its implications for pulmonary ventilation."
