    "summary": "In this context, nitrate plays a crucial role in respiration, particularly in anaerobic conditions. Oral bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrite, which can then be further reduced to nitric oxide (NO) under low oxygen conditions. This process highlights the importance of nitrate in facilitating bacterial respiration when oxygen is scarce, demonstrating a direct link between nitrate and respiratory processes in both bacteria and the human body."
