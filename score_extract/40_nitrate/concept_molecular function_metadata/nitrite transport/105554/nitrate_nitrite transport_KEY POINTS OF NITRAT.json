    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite transport are closely related through the functionality of NRT2 proteins, which include specific nitrite transporters like NAR1.1 and NAR1.2. These transporters facilitate the uptake of nitrite, improving nitrate use efficiency in organisms such as Chlamydomonas. The regulation of these transport processes is influenced by nitrogen sources, highlighting the interconnectedness of nitrate and nitrite in nutrient assimilation and transport mechanisms."
