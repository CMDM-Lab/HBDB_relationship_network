    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with its assimilation in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. The expression of the nitrate transport system and related enzymes is negatively regulated by ammonium, which inhibits the transcription of the nirA operon. This indicates a direct relationship between nitrate and genetic transcription, as the presence of ammonium affects the transcriptional activity of genes responsible for nitrate assimilation."
