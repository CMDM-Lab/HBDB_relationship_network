    "summary": "In this context, dietary nitrate (NO3âˆ’) intake is shown to enhance the speed and power of human muscle during exercise, particularly at moderate-to-high angular velocities. The study indicates that nitrate supplementation may improve muscle function by increasing nitric oxide (NO) availability, suggesting potential benefits for both athletes and clinical populations. However, the effects were assessed only during specific exercises, leaving questions about broader applicability."
