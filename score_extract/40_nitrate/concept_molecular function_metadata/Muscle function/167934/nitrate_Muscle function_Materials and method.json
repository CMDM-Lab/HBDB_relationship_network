    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to muscle function through its role in enhancing aerobic exercise performance. The study investigates the effects of dietary nitrate intake from a beetroot juice supplement on muscle contractile function during a knee extension exercise test. Measurements of breath nitric oxide (NO) and muscle power output are taken to assess the impact of nitrate on muscle performance, indicating a potential beneficial effect of nitrate on muscle function during exercise."
