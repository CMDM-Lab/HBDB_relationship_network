    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in a biological process where facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity reduce nitrate and nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) under anaerobic conditions. The study highlights how this process is disrupted by high oxygen tension, which inhibits the bacteria's ability to convert nitrate to NO, thereby affecting the levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO). This indicates a significant relationship between nitrate and the biological process of NO generation in the oral cavity."
