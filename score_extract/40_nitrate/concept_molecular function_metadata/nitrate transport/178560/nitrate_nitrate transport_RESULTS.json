    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate transport are closely related as the study investigates the mechanisms of nitrate uptake in cyanobacteria. The research highlights how nitrate transport is influenced by ammonium levels, demonstrating that nitrate is actively transported into cells, particularly in the presence of ammonium. The experiments with NR-deficient mutants further elucidate the specific transport activity of nitrate, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its transport mechanism within the cells."
