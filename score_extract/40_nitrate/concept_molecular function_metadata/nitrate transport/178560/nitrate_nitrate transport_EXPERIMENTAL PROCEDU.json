    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate transport are closely related as the study investigates the transport activity of nitrate in Synechococcus cells. The transfer of ammonium-grown cells to a nitrite-containing medium induces nitrate transport activity, which is measured by the accumulation of intracellular nitrate. This indicates a direct relationship between the presence of nitrate and its transport mechanisms within the cells."
