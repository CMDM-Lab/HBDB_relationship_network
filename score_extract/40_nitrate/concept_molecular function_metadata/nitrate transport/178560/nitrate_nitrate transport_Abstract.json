    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate transport are directly related as the text discusses the process of nitrate assimilation in cyanobacteria, emphasizing that nitrate transport into the cell is a major rate-limiting step. The regulation of this transport is influenced by ammonium, and the molecular mechanisms involved are under investigation. The nitrate transport system is characterized as a nitrate/nitrite transporter, indicating a specific functional relationship between nitrate and its transport mechanism."
