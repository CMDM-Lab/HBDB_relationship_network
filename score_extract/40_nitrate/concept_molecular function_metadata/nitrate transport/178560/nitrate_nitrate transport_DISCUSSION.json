    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrate transport are closely related through the discussion of the molecular mechanisms regulating nitrate/nitrite transport activity, particularly involving the C-terminal domain of the NrtC protein. The regulation of nitrate transport is suggested to involve phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes, indicating a direct functional relationship between nitrate and its transport mechanisms in cyanobacteria."
