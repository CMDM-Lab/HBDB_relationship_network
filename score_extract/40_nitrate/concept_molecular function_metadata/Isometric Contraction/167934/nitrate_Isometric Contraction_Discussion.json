    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its conversion to nitric oxide (NO) and its effects on muscle fibers during isometric contraction. The study suggests that dietary nitrate intake may enhance muscle function, particularly in type II muscle fibers, during high angular velocity contractions. However, during voluntary isometric contractions, the recruitment of both type I and type II fibers may dilute the effects of NO, indicating that the benefits of nitrate may be more pronounced under specific conditions that favor type II fiber recruitment."
