    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and oxidation are directly related through the process of nitrification, which involves the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. This biogeochemical process is crucial for nitrogen cycling and plays a significant role in detoxifying excess ammonia in coastal ecosystems. The study highlights the importance of nitrification in both environmental health and the management of nitrogen pollution."
