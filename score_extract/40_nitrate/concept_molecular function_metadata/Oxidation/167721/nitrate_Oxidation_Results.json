    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its interaction with bacteria in saliva, leading to the generation of nitric oxide (NO) gas. The presence of 100% oxygen significantly inhibits this process, suggesting that oxidation plays a crucial role in the conversion of nitrite to nitrate. The findings indicate that oxidation affects the levels of NO and its precursors in the presence of high oxygen tensions, highlighting a significant relationship between nitrate and oxidation processes in vivo."
