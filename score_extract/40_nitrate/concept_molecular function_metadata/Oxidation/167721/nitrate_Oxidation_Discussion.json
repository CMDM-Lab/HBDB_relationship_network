    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and oxidation are related through the discussion of nitrite reduction and the potential oxidation of nitrite to nitrate during hyperoxia. The text suggests that elevated oxygen levels or reactive oxygen species may facilitate the oxidation process, although the specific relationship between nitrate levels and oxidation is not quantitatively detailed. The mention of nitrate in the context of oxidation indicates a potential interaction, but it remains somewhat ambiguous."
