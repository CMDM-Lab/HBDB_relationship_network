    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a product of nitric oxide (NO) oxidation, where total nitrites and nitrates are measured as end products. The methodology involves converting nitrates into nitrites for quantification, indicating a direct relationship between nitrate levels and the oxidation process of NO. This highlights the role of nitrates in the biochemical pathway of NO metabolism and its implications in physiological processes."
