    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its uptake and accumulation in NC2 cells, particularly in the presence of ammonium, which inhibits nitrate reduction activity. However, the term 'Adjudication' does not appear to have a direct connection to the biochemical processes involving nitrate, as it is not mentioned in the context of nitrate metabolism or transport mechanisms. Therefore, the relationship between nitrate and adjudication is unclear and lacks direct relevance."
