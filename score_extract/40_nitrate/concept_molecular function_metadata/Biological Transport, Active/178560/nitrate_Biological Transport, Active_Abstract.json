    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is described as a crucial nitrogen source for cyanobacteria, which is actively transported into the cell via a specific transport system. The process of nitrate assimilation involves its reduction to ammonium through the action of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. The active transport of nitrate is essential for its uptake and subsequent metabolic processing, highlighting a direct relationship between nitrate and active biological transport mechanisms in cyanobacteria."
