    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is identified as a nitrogen source that is actively transported by certain strains of bacteria. The study highlights that the NC2 strain can utilize nitrate effectively through active transport, while the NC3 strain cannot. The NrtC polypeptide is essential for this active transport mechanism, indicating a direct relationship between nitrate and its biological transport process."
