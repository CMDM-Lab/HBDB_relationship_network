    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is implicated in the regulatory functions related to signal transduction pathways in Chlamydomonas, particularly concerning nitrate assimilation. The study highlights a complex network that mediates negative signaling of nitrate assimilation, suggesting that nitrate plays a significant role in the regulatory and metabolic circuits involved in this process. However, the specific mechanisms of signal transduction related to nitrate are not fully elucidated, indicating a need for further research."
