    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to cell growth through its role in the nitrogen assimilation pathway, particularly in the regulation of NAR1 genes in organisms like Chlamydomonas. The NAR1.1 gene facilitates nitrite transport, enhancing nitrate use efficiency for cell growth under varying environmental conditions, indicating that nitrate availability directly influences cellular growth processes."
