    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its transport by the NrtC protein, specifically highlighting the importance of the N-terminal ATP-binding domain for its activity. The study indicates that the ability to transport nitrate is linked to the structural features of the NrtC protein, particularly its N-terminus, suggesting a direct relationship between nitrate utilization and protein N-terminus binding functionality."
