    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) supplementation is investigated for its potential effects on muscle properties, specifically muscle speed and power. However, the study found no correlation between changes in breath nitric oxide (NO) levels and muscle contractile properties. It suggests that individual differences, such as muscle fiber composition, may influence the response to dietary nitrate, indicating that not all individuals benefit from nitrate supplementation in terms of muscle performance."
