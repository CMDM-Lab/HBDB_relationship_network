    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) intake is linked to the enhancement of muscle performance, specifically influencing the speed and power of human muscle during electrically-stimulated isometric contractions. The study indicates that dietary nitrate can improve the rate of force development and peak force output in the quadriceps muscle, although no such effects were observed during voluntary contractions. This suggests a significant relationship between nitrate consumption and muscle force generation under certain conditions."
