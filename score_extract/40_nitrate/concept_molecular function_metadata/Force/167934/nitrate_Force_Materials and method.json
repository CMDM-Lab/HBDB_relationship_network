    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the assessment of force production during muscle function testing. The study investigates the effects of dietary nitrate intake on aerobic exercise performance and muscle contractile function, specifically measuring maximal voluntary force during knee extension exercises. The relationship suggests that dietary nitrate may enhance muscle performance, as indicated by the force measurements taken during the tests."
