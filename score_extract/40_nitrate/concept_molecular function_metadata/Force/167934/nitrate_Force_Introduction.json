    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the assessment of muscle force and contractile function following the ingestion of beetroot juice, which is high in dietary nitrates. The study investigates how dietary nitrate affects the force-velocity relationship of human muscle during isometric contractions, indicating a direct relationship between nitrate intake and muscle performance metrics such as force and power output during exercise."
