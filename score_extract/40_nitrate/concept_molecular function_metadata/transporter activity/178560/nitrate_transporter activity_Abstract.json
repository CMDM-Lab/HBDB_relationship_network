    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is actively transported by an ATP-binding cassette transporter in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, specifically through the genes nrtA, nrtB, nrtC, and nrtD. The study highlights that the transporter activity is inhibited by ammonium, indicating a regulatory mechanism in nitrogen assimilation. The C-terminal domain of the transporter subunit NrtC plays a role in this inhibition, as evidenced by the mutant NC2, which shows altered nitrate accumulation and transport characteristics compared to wild-type cells. This illustrates a direct relationship between nitrate and transporter activity in the context of nutrient uptake regulation."
