    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is highlighted as a precursor to nitric oxide (NO), which is known to exhibit broad antimicrobial effects against pathogens commonly associated with cystic fibrosis (CF), such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The study suggests that dietary nitrate can enhance NO production, thereby potentially improving antimicrobial activity in CF airway conditions. This relationship underscores the importance of dietary nitrate in managing infections in CF patients."
