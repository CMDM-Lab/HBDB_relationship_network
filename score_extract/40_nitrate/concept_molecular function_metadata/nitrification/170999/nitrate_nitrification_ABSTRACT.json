    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrification are closely related as nitrification is defined as the biological process that converts ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. The text emphasizes the critical role of nitrification in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle, highlighting its importance in detoxifying excess ammonia in coastal ecosystems and contributing to the formation of nitrate reservoirs. This indicates a direct and significant relationship between the two terms, as nitrate is a product of the nitrification process."
