    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is indirectly related to exhalation through its role in the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the respiratory system. The study measures exhaled NO levels, which are influenced by salivary nitrate and nitrite levels, as these compounds are converted by bacteria to produce NO. However, the specific relationship between nitrate levels and exhalation is not quantitatively detailed, as the study primarily focuses on the effects of HBO2 on exhaled NO rather than a direct correlation with nitrate levels."
