    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is investigated for its acute impact on exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels in patients with cystic fibrosis. The study compares the effects of dietary nitrate from beetroot juice against a nitrate-depleted placebo on exhalation of NO. This suggests a direct relationship where dietary nitrate influences the exhalation of NO, a marker of airway inflammation and respiratory function."
