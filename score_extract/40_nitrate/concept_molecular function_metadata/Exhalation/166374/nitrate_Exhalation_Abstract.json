    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to exhalation through its role in increasing exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The study highlights that dietary nitrate can be ingested and subsequently converted to nitrite and NO, leading to acute increases in exhaled NO, which is typically decreased in CF. This suggests a potential therapeutic approach to enhance airway function in CF patients by improving exhaled NO levels."
