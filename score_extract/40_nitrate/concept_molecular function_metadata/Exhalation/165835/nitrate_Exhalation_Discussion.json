    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to exhalation through its role in increasing plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels, which may influence exhaled NO (PENO) production. The study suggests that nitrate supplementation could help mitigate declines in PENO during altitude exposure, potentially offering protective effects against pulmonary hypertension. However, the relationship is speculative, as exhaled NO levels do not directly reflect pulmonary vascular function."
