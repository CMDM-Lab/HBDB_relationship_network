    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to vasodilation through its role in dietary supplementation, which has been shown to enhance blood flow and improve vasodilation during hypoxic exercise. The study suggests that the effects of nitrate on vasodilation may vary with age, as older individuals benefit more from nitrate supplementation compared to younger participants. This indicates a physiological relationship where nitrate influences vascular responses, particularly under hypoxic conditions."
