    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to ingestion as a dietary source to potentially increase systemic nitric oxide (NO) levels. The study highlights a case where a 12-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis showed significant increases in exhaled NO after consuming dietary nitrate, suggesting that ingestion of nitrate can enhance NO production, which is beneficial for lung function in cystic fibrosis patients. This relationship underscores the therapeutic potential of dietary nitrate in managing conditions associated with low NO levels."
