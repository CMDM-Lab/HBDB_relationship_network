    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) is directly linked to ingestion through the consumption of beetroot juice, which is highlighted as a rich source of dietary nitrate. The study hypothesizes that acute intake of nitrate can enhance muscle performance, specifically in terms of speed and power during exercise. This relationship is explored through the assessment of muscle contractile function following ingestion, indicating a significant connection between dietary nitrate intake and its physiological effects on muscle performance."
