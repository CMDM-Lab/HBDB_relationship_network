    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) ingestion is directly linked to enhanced muscle performance, specifically in terms of speed and power during exercise. The study indicates that dietary intake of nitrate can improve muscle function, particularly at moderate-to-high angular velocities. This suggests that nitrate ingestion plays a significant role in optimizing physical performance, although the effects of prolonged supplementation remain uncertain."
