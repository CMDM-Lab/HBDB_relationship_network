    "summary": "In this context, dietary nitrate is linked to ingestion through the supplementation of beetroot juice, which is a source of nitrate. The study investigates the effects of this nitrate ingestion on symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) and physiological variables during high altitude trekking. While the study concludes that nitrate supplementation does not significantly alter AMS symptoms or key physiological variables, it emphasizes the feasibility and safety of nitrate ingestion at altitude, suggesting a need for further research on its potential benefits."
