    "summary": "In this context, nitrate ingestion is directly linked to the physiological response observed in plasma nitrate and nitrite levels. Following sodium nitrate consumption, there is a rapid increase in plasma nitrates, which is crucial for subsequent physiological effects, such as the rise in cGMP. The study highlights the importance of dietary nitrate uptake and its conversion to nitrite in the oral cavity, indicating that ingestion of nitrates plays a significant role in enhancing their bioavailability and subsequent physiological responses during exercise testing."
