    "summary": "In this context, nitrate supplementation is investigated for its effects on physiological responses to hypoxia, particularly during acute normobaric hypoxic exposure. The studies indicate that nitrate can enhance oxygen saturation and improve exercise performance under hypoxic conditions. However, its efficacy appears limited during prolonged hypoxic exposure, suggesting a nuanced relationship where nitrate may be beneficial in acute scenarios but not in sustained hypoxia."
