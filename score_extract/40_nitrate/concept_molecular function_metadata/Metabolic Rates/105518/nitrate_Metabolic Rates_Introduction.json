    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to metabolic rates through its role in enhancing nitric oxide (NO) production, which has various physiological effects, including lowering resting metabolic rate and improving exercise performance. Nitrate supplementation has been shown to increase oxygen saturation and enhance muscle energetics during exercise, indicating a significant impact on metabolic responses. However, the effects on metabolic rates may vary with the duration of hypoxic exposure, suggesting a complex relationship between nitrate intake and metabolic function."
