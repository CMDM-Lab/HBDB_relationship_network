    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, where it is reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria, a process that is inhibited by oxygen (oxidants). The presence of oxidants affects the efficiency of nitrate reduction and subsequent NO generation, highlighting a complex interplay between nitrate metabolism and oxidative conditions in the body. The regulation of NO production is influenced by oxygen saturation and the redox state of hemoglobin, indicating that oxidants play a critical role in modulating the effects of nitrate."
