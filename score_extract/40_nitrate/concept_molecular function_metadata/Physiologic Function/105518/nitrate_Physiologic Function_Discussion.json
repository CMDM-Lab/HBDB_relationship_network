    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation effects on physiological functions during high altitude exposure. The study found that nitrate supplementation, specifically through beetroot juice, did not significantly alter symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) or key physiological variables such as oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. This suggests that while nitrate is known to influence physiological functions, its effects may not be evident under sustained hypoxic conditions at altitude."
