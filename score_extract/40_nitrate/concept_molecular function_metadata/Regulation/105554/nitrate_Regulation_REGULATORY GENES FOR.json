    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to the regulation of its assimilation in Chlamydomonas, with specific mutants identified that are defective in genes related to this regulatory process. The study highlights a complex network of regulatory functions that mediate the signaling pathways associated with nitrate assimilation, indicating that understanding these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for elucidating how nitrate is processed in photosynthetic eukaryotes."
