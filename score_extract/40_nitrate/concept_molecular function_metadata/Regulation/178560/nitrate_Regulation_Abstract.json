    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is involved in the process of assimilation by cyanobacteria, which is regulated post-translationally. The regulation of nitrate transport into the cell is influenced by the presence of ammonium, indicating a complex interaction where ammonium inhibits nitrate transport. The study highlights the need for further investigation into the metabolic signals and molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation."
