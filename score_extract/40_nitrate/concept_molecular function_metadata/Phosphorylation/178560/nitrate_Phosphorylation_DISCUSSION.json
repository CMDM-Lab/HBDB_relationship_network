    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to phosphorylation through the regulation of nitrate transport in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 6301. The study suggests that the activity of a plasma membrane protein kinase, which phosphorylates membrane proteins, is influenced by ammonium exposure. This indicates that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes may regulate nitrate transport, highlighting a significant biochemical interaction between nitrate transport mechanisms and phosphorylation events."
