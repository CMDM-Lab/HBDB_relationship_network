    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is linked to phosphorylation through its conversion to nitric oxide (NO), which activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels. This cascade likely leads to the phosphorylation of myosin, enhancing muscular performance. The study suggests that the nitrate-induced increase in NO is a key mechanism for improved muscle function, although other direct effects of NO on proteins are considered unlikely."
