    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned in relation to its measurement in plasma and saliva samples, but there is no direct discussion of its role in cytokinesis of the fertilized ovum. The focus is primarily on the analytical methods for determining nitrate and nitrite levels, without any exploration of how these compounds might influence or relate to the process of cytokinesis in fertilized ova. Therefore, the relationship between nitrate and cytokinesis is not established in this context."
