    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is mentioned in relation to the GAF domain of the NIT2 protein, which is known to bind small molecules like oxoglutarate and nitric oxide. However, it is specifically noted that nitrate does not bind to this domain, indicating a lack of interaction between nitrate and the small molecules typically associated with this protein. This suggests that while nitrate is a small molecule, it does not participate in the same binding interactions as others within this context."
