    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and chlorides are both mentioned as components analyzed in plasma samples, but their specific relationship is not detailed. Nitrate is measured as part of the total plasma nitrites and nitrates (NOx), while chlorides are not explicitly discussed in relation to nitrate. The context focuses on the methodology for measuring these substances rather than their interaction or significance together."
