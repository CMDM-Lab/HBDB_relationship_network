    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, highlighting its role in the generation of nitric oxide (NO) gas when incubated with bacteria-containing saliva. The study discusses the dynamics of nitrate and nitrite in the presence of oxygen, indicating their interconversion and the impact of high oxygen levels on NO production. The relationship is primarily chemical, focusing on the behavior of nitrate in biological systems."
