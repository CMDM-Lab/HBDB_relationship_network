    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' refers to a class of medications, specifically long-acting nitrates, used for symptom relief in patients undergoing treatment for angina. The mention of nitrates indicates their role in managing cardiovascular conditions, particularly in conjunction with other antianginal medications. However, there is no distinct discussion differentiating between 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' as separate entities, suggesting they are used interchangeably in this context."
