    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same compound, specifically in the form of oral nitrate supplementation through beetroot juice. The study investigates the physiological effects of nitrate on responses to high altitude exposure, indicating that nitrate supplementation can enhance endothelial function and potentially alleviate symptoms of acute mountain sickness. The terms are used interchangeably, emphasizing the significance of nitrate in the study's focus on physiological adaptations to hypoxia."
