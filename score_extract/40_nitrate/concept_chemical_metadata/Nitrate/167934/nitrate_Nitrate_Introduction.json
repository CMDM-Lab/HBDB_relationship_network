    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3âˆ’) is discussed as a dietary component that serves as a significant source of nitric oxide (NO) in the body. The physiological effects of dietary nitrate are highlighted, particularly its role in enhancing muscle contractile properties through the production of cyclic GMP (cGMP) via soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activation. This suggests a direct relationship between dietary nitrate and its conversion to NO, which influences muscle function."
