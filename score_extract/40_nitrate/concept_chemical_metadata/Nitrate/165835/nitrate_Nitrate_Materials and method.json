    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, with the latter likely being a typographical emphasis or variation in capitalization. The study discusses the analysis of nitrite and nitrate levels in blood samples during hypobaric hypoxia, indicating their relevance in physiological responses to oxygen levels. However, there is no distinct discussion of their functional relationship beyond their chemical identity."
