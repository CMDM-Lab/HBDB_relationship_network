    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically sodium nitrate, which is being tested for its effects on exercise performance under hypobaric hypoxia conditions. The study examines physiological responses to nitrate ingestion, including changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate during exercise, indicating a direct relationship as they are essentially the same term used in different contexts."
