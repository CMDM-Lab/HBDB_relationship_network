    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and Nitrate refer to the same chemical species, with the discussion focusing on the behavior of ONO2− and its conversion to nitrate in solution. The text indicates that ONO2− can isomerize to nitrate, suggesting a direct chemical relationship where nitrate is a product of the reaction involving ONO2− and cytochrome c oxidase. This highlights the significance of nitrate in the biochemical processes being studied."
