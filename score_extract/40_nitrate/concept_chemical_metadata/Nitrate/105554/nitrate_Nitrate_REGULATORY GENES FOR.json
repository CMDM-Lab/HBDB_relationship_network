    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, with the text discussing various mutants that are involved in nitrate assimilation and signaling pathways. The focus is on the genetic aspects of nitrate utilization in certain strains, indicating that both terms are used interchangeably to describe the same biochemical process related to nitrate metabolism. However, there is no distinct functional relationship or differentiation between the two terms presented in the context."
