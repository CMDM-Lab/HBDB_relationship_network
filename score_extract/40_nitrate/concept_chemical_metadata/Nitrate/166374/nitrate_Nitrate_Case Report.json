    "summary": "In this context, 'nitrate' and 'Nitrate' refer to the same chemical compound, specifically in relation to dietary intake and its effects on pulmonary function and exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels. The study examines the impact of a low nitrate breakfast on the reduction of dietary nitrate to nitric oxide (NO) in vivo, highlighting the physiological relevance of nitrate in respiratory health. However, the terms are used interchangeably without distinct differentiation in their roles or effects."
