    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a product of nitrification, which involves the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. The relationship between nitrate and the terms 'NITRATE AND NITRITE' is significant, as both are integral components of the nitrogen cycle, with nitrate being the final product of this process. The study highlights the importance of these compounds in biogeochemical cycling and their role in mitigating nitrogen pollution in coastal ecosystems."
