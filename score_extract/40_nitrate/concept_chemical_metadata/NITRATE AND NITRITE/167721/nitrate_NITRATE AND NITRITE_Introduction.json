    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is directly related to the production of nitric oxide (NO) through its reduction to nitrite by oral bacteria. Nitrate from dietary sources, particularly leafy greens, serves as a substrate for this biochemical pathway. The conversion of nitrate to nitrite is crucial for recycling NO bioactivity, highlighting the interconnected roles of nitrate and nitrite in physiological processes, particularly in the oral cavity where bacterial activity significantly influences their levels."
