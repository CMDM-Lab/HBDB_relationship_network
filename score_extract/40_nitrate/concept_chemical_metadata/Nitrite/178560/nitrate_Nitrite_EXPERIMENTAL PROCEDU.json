    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are discussed in relation to their transport and accumulation in cells. The transfer of ammonium-grown cells to a nitrite-containing medium induces nitrate transport activity, indicating a functional relationship where nitrite may serve as a precursor or substrate for nitrate metabolism. The methods described for measuring both compounds suggest they are part of a biochemical pathway involving nitrate reduction processes."
