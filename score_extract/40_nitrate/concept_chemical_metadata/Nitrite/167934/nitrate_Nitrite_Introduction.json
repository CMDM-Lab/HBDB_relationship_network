    "summary": "In this context, nitrate (NO3−) is described as a precursor to nitrite (NO2−) in a metabolic pathway that contributes to nitric oxide (NO) production in the body. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite occurs through the action of facultative anaerobic bacteria in the mouth, followed by the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide. This pathway is highlighted as a significant alternative to the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway, indicating a direct and critical relationship between nitrate and nitrite in the context of NO production."
