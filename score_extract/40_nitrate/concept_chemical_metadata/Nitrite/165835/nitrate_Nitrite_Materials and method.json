    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are related through their roles in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and vascular function. The study investigates the effects of acute nitrate supplementation on forearm blood flow and exercise performance, with nitrite being a key product of nitrate metabolism. The relationship is significant as nitrite can be converted to nitric oxide, which is crucial for enhancing blood flow and oxygenation during exercise, particularly at high altitudes."
