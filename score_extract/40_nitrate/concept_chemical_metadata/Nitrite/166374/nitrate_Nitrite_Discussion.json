    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are closely related through the metabolic pathway where dietary nitrate is absorbed and subsequently reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. This nitrite can then be further converted to nitric oxide (NO) under appropriate conditions in the body. The process highlights the physiological significance of nitrate as a precursor to nitrite and NO, which are important for various biological functions, including vasodilation and respiratory health."
