    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are analyzed as part of a study involving blood and saliva samples collected during hyperbaric exposure. The laboratory methods detail the determination of both compounds through chemiluminescence after reductive cleavage, indicating a direct relationship where nitrate can be converted to nitrite in biological samples. This suggests their interconnected roles in physiological processes, particularly in the context of nitric oxide (NO) production."
