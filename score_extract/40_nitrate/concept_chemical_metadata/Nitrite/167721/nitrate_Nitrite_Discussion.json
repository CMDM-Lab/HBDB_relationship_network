    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrite are closely related as they are both measured in saliva to assess the role of oral bacteria in the generation of nitric oxide (NO). The salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio indicates the activity of oral bacteria in reducing nitrate to nitrite. The study highlights how high oxygen tension affects this ratio, suggesting that increased salivary nitrate levels may result from reduced bacterial consumption of nitrate, thereby influencing NO generation. This relationship underscores the biochemical interplay between nitrate and nitrite in the context of oral microbiota and NO production."
