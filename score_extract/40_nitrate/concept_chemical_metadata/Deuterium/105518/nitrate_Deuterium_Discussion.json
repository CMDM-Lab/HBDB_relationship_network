    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation effects on physiological parameters during hypoxic exposure, while Deuterium is not directly mentioned or linked to nitrate. The study focuses on the impact of dietary nitrate on nitric oxide (NO) availability and its physiological effects, without any reference to Deuterium's role or relevance in this process. Thus, there is no established relationship between nitrate and Deuterium in the provided context."
