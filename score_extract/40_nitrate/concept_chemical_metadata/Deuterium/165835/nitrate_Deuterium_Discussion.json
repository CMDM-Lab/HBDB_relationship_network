    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a dietary source of nitric oxide (NO) that facilitates hypoxic vasodilation, particularly when NO synthesis is compromised. However, Deuterium is not mentioned in relation to nitrate or its physiological effects. The context focuses on the effects of nitrate supplementation on plasma levels and exercise performance, with no direct connection to Deuterium."
