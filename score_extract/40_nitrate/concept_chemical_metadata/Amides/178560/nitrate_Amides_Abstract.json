    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is described as a crucial nitrogen source for cyanobacteria, which is transported into the cell and subsequently reduced to ammonium. This ammonium is then incorporated into amide nitrogen, specifically in the synthesis of glutamine (Gln). The relationship highlights the metabolic pathway where nitrate serves as a precursor for amide formation, indicating a direct biochemical connection between the two terms."
