    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a precursor in the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, where it is reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. Both nitrate and nitrite are classified as anions, and their levels in saliva are significantly higher than in plasma. This highlights the role of these anions in biological processes, particularly in the generation of nitric oxide (NO) under specific conditions such as hypoxia."
