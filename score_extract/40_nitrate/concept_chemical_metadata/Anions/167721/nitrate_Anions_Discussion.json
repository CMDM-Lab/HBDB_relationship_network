    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a substrate for facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity, which can reduce nitrate and nitrite (both anions) to nitric oxide (NO) under anaerobic conditions. The study highlights how the presence of oxygen disrupts this reduction process, leading to decreased levels of these anions and subsequently affecting nitric oxide generation during oral exhalation. Thus, nitrate and anions are interconnected through their biochemical transformation by oral bacteria, particularly in varying oxygen conditions."
