    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and stable isotopes are discussed in relation to the investigation of nitric oxide (NO) generation and metabolism during hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) exposure. The use of stable isotopes of nitrate, along with L-arginine and nitrite, is suggested as a method to better understand the effects of HBO2 on the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. This indicates a potential analytical relationship where stable isotopes could enhance the study of nitrate's role in NO production."
