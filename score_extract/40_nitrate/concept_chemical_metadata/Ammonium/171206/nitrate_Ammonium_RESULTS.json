    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are related through their roles in the growth of Nitrosospira strains, particularly in ammonia oxidation processes. The study assesses how varying concentrations of ammonium affect the production of nitrite and nitrate during the growth of these strains. The relationship indicates that ammonium serves as a substrate for the nitrifying bacteria, which convert it into nitrite and subsequently nitrate, highlighting their interconnected roles in nitrogen cycling."
