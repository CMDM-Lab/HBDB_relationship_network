    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are connected through their roles in the regulation of nitrate transport in Synechococcus sp. The presence of ammonium activates a soluble phosphatase and inactivates a protein kinase, which may influence the phosphorylation state of nitrate transporters like NrtC. This suggests that ammonium plays a regulatory role in nitrate transport mechanisms, potentially affecting how nitrate is taken up by the cells."
