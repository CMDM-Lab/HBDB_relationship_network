    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are related through their interactions in cyanobacterial cells, particularly regarding nitrate accumulation and reduction. The presence of ammonium inhibits nitrate reductase (NR) activity, affecting the intracellular concentration of nitrate. While nitrate can accumulate in the presence of ammonium, its uptake is inhibited, indicating a complex regulatory relationship between these two compounds in the metabolic processes of cyanobacteria."
