    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are related through the function of the NrtC protein, which is part of the nitrate transporter in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942. The study indicates that ammonium promotes the inhibition of nitrate uptake, suggesting a regulatory relationship where ammonium levels can affect the transport and accumulation of nitrate within the cells. This interaction highlights the importance of ammonium in modulating nitrate transport processes."
