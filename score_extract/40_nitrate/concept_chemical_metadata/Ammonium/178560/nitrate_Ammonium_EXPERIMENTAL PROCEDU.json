    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are related through their roles as nitrogen sources for Synechococcus cells. The study indicates that ammonium was used as the nitrogen source for growth, and upon transferring these cells to a nitrite-containing medium, nitrate transport activity was induced. This suggests a metabolic interplay where ammonium influences the utilization of nitrate in the cells."
