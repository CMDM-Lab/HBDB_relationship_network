    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are discussed in relation to the regulation of the NIT2 gene in Chlamydomonas, which is involved in nitrate assimilation. The NIT2 gene is repressed in the presence of ammonium, indicating that ammonium serves as a nitrogen source that inhibits the expression of genes necessary for nitrate assimilation. This suggests a competitive relationship where ammonium availability affects the utilization of nitrate."
