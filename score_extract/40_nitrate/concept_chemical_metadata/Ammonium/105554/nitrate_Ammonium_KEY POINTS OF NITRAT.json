    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are connected through their roles in nitrogen metabolism, specifically in the regulation of nitrate assimilation genes. The gene NIA1, which encodes nitrate reductase, is regulated by the nitrogen source, showing nitrate induction and ammonium repression. This indicates that the presence of ammonium can inhibit the utilization of nitrate, highlighting their interdependent relationship in nitrogen assimilation pathways."
