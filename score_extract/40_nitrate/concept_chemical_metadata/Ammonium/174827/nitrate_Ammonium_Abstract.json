    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and ammonium are both assessed as indicators of nitrogen availability in forest soils influenced by cicada litterfall. The study indicates that cicada litterfall positively correlates with the availability of both nitrate and ammonium, suggesting that the decomposition of nitrogen-rich litter contributes to the sustained presence of these nitrogen forms in the soil over time. This relationship highlights the role of cicada litter in enhancing soil nutrient dynamics."
