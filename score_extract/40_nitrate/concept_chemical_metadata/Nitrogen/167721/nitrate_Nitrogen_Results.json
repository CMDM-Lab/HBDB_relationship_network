    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrogen are related through their roles in bacterial metabolism. The study investigates how different gas environments (nitrogen, air, and oxygen) affect the conversion of nitrate to nitrite by oral tongue bacteria. Nitrogen serves as an inert gas that enhances the bacterial conversion process, while oxygen significantly inhibits it. The generation of nitric oxide (NO) from nitrate in the presence of nitrogen further illustrates the biochemical interactions between these two terms."
