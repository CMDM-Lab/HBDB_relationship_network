    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is directly related to nitrogen as it is a key nitrogen source for organisms like Chlamydomonas. The NIT2 gene plays a crucial role in nitrate assimilation, indicating that nitrate is essential for nitrogen metabolism. The study highlights the regulatory mechanisms of nitrate in nitrogen-free media, emphasizing its importance in nitrogen signaling and gene expression."
