    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and nitrogen are closely related through the process of nitrification, which involves the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. This process is crucial for the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, contributing to the formation of nitrate reservoirs in deep-sea environments. The relationship highlights the role of nitrate as a key nitrogen compound in ecological and environmental processes, particularly in bioremediation and pollution mitigation in coastal ecosystems."
