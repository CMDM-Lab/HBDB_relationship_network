    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a nitrogen source for the growth of certain bacterial strains. The study highlights the ability of the wild-type strain and NC2 to utilize nitrate effectively, indicating that nitrate serves as a critical form of nitrogen for cellular metabolism. The relationship emphasizes the role of nitrate in nitrogen assimilation processes in bacteria, linking it directly to nitrogen's biological significance."
