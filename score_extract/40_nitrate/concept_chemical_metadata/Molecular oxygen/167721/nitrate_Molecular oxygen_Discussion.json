    "summary": "In this context, nitrate and molecular oxygen are related through the metabolic processes of facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity. These bacteria utilize salivary nitrate and nitrite to produce nitric oxide (NO) under anaerobic conditions. However, the presence of molecular oxygen inhibits this reduction process, leading to decreased NO generation. The study highlights how high oxygen tension disrupts the bacteria's ability to convert nitrate and nitrite to NO, thereby affecting the levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)."
