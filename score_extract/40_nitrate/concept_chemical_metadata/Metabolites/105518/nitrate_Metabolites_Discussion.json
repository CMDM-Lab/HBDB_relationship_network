    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation through beetroot juice and its potential effects on metabolites such as nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives (nitrate and nitrite). The study indicates that while previous research showed increased plasma levels of these metabolites following nitrate ingestion, the current study could not confirm this due to limitations in measuring circulating NO metabolites. Thus, the relationship between dietary nitrate and its metabolites is acknowledged but remains inconclusive in this specific study."
