    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its role in the assimilation pathway in Chlamydomonas, particularly through the regulation of the NIT2 gene. The expression of various genes involved in nitrate and nitrite assimilation is affected by the presence of nitrate, indicating that nitrate acts as a signaling molecule influencing the metabolism of these compounds. The study highlights the importance of nitrate in regulating metabolic processes, particularly under nitrogen-free conditions, where it can still impact gene expression and metabolite pathways."
