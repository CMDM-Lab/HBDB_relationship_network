    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed as a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) through a pathway involving oral bacteria that convert nitrate to nitrite, which can then be further reduced to NO. This process highlights the role of dietary nitrate in increasing blood levels of NO metabolites, demonstrating its significance in physiological functions such as blood pressure regulation and exercise performance. The relationship between nitrate and metabolites is thus critical, as dietary nitrate intake directly influences the production of NO and its metabolites in the body."
