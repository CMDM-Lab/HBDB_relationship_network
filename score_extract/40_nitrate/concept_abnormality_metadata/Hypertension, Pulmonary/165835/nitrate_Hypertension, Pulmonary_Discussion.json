    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its potential effects on pulmonary hypertension, particularly during altitude exposure. Nitrate supplementation is suggested to increase plasma NOx levels, which may help mitigate hypoxic increases in pulmonary arterial pressure. While the study acknowledges that exhaled NO levels do not directly reflect pulmonary vascular function, the hypothesis is that increased NO production could offer protective effects against developing pulmonary hypertension. However, the relationship remains speculative and requires further investigation to confirm its efficacy in reducing pulmonary arterial pressure."
