    "summary": "In this context, nitrate, specifically from beetroot juice, is investigated for its potential effects on physiological responses and symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) during high-altitude trekking. The study aims to determine whether oral nitrate supplementation can alleviate AMS symptoms and improve physiological function in individuals ascending to high altitudes, suggesting a direct relationship between nitrate intake and AMS management."
