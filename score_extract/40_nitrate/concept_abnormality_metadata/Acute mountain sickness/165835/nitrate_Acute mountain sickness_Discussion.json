    "summary": "In this context, nitrate is discussed in relation to its supplementation during high-altitude exposure and its potential effects on vascular function. However, the study indicates that nitrate supplementation does not significantly reduce symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) or improve oxygen saturation (SaO2) during rapid ascents. While there may be vascular benefits from nitrate over longer exposures, its direct impact on AMS remains inconclusive, suggesting that other factors may play a more critical role in the development of AMS."
