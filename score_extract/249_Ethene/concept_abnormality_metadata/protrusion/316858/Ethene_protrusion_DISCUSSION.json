    "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, specifically in promoting the weakening of the endosperm cap to facilitate radicle protrusion. Ethylene's role in inducing endosperm weakening is crucial for allowing the radicle to emerge, highlighting a direct relationship between ethylene signaling and the mechanical process of protrusion during germination."
