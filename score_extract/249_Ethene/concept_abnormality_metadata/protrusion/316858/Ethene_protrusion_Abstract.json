    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the process of radicle protrusion during seed germination, particularly in thermotolerant lettuce genotypes. Ethylene production is associated with increased activity of cell wall-remodeling enzymes, such as endo-Î²-mannanase, which facilitate the weakening of the lettuce endosperm, thereby enabling the radicle to protrude. This suggests a direct stimulatory effect of ethylene on the mechanisms that promote seed germination and radicle emergence."
