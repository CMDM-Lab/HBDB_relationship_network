    "summary": "In this context, ethene and jasmonate are linked through their roles in plant stress responses. The study discusses how ERF transcription factors integrate signals from ethylene, jasmonate, and abscisic acid (ABA) to manage responses to abiotic stresses. This suggests that both compounds are part of a signaling network that regulates plant tolerance to environmental challenges, although their specific interactions are not detailed."
