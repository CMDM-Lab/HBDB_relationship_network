    "summary": "In this context, ethene is indirectly related to carboxylate through the ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants. Ethylene is produced from 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylate (ACC), which is synthesized from S-adenosyl-Met by ACC synthase. While carboxylate is not explicitly discussed, it serves as a precursor in the pathway leading to ethylene production, linking the two terms in the context of plant physiology and seed dormancy regulation."
