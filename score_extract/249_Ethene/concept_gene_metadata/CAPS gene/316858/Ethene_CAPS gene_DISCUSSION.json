    "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, where it induces endosperm weakening to facilitate radicle emergence. The CAPS gene, while not directly mentioned, is part of the broader genetic framework involved in the regulation of germination processes. Ethylene's role in promoting the expression of genes related to endosperm cap weakening suggests a potential indirect relationship with the CAPS gene, which may be involved in similar regulatory pathways during germination."
