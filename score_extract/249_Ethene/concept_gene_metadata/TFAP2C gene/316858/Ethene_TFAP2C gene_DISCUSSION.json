    "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, where it induces endosperm weakening to facilitate radicle protrusion. The TFAP2C gene, while not directly mentioned, is part of the broader regulatory network involving ERF transcription factors that respond to ethylene signaling. This suggests a potential indirect relationship where ethylene influences the expression of genes like TFAP2C in the context of seed germination, although the specific role of TFAP2C is not detailed in the provided context."
