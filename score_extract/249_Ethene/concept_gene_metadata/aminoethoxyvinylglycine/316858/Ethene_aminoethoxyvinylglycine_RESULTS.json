    "summary": "In this context, ethene and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) are related through their roles in seed germination and ethylene biosynthesis. AVG is used to inhibit the production of ethylene by blocking the activity of the enzyme ACS, which is crucial for ethylene synthesis. The study investigates how varying concentrations of AVG affect germination temperatures in seeds, indicating a direct interaction where AVG modulates the effects of ethylene on seed germination."
