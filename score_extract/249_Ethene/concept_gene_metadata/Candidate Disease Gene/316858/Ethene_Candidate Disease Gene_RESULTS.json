    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the expression of dormancy-associated genes and germination-associated genes in seeds. The study indicates that exposure to ethylene influences gene expression related to germination, particularly in seeds carrying the PI allele at Htg9.1. However, the term 'Candidate Disease Gene' is not explicitly defined or connected to ethylene in the provided context, making the relationship unclear."
