    "summary": "In this context, ethylene is linked to the thermotolerance of lettuce seeds during high-temperature germination, with a specific focus on a homologous gene, LsERF1, which is associated with ethylene signaling. The study suggests that LsERF1 plays a crucial role in promoting gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, thereby counteracting the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on seed germination. This indicates a significant relationship between ethylene signaling and the expression of the homologous gene in regulating seed dormancy and germination under temperature stress."
