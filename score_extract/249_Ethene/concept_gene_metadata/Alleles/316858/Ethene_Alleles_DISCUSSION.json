    "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to the action of GA (gibberellins) in promoting seed germination and thermotolerance, particularly in seeds with PI alleles at Htg9.1. The study indicates that ethylene and GA work together to counteract the inhibitory effects of ABA (abscisic acid) on germination. The relationship highlights the genetic influence of alleles on the physiological response to ethylene, suggesting that specific alleles can affect how seeds respond to hormonal signals during germination."
