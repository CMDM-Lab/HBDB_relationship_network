    "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to the expression of specific genes associated with germination in seeds, particularly those carrying the PI allele at Htg9.1. The study indicates that exposure to ethylene significantly influences the expression of germination-associated genes while reducing dormancy-associated gene expression. This suggests that the presence of certain alleles may affect how seeds respond to ethylene, highlighting a genetic component in the physiological response to this plant hormone."
