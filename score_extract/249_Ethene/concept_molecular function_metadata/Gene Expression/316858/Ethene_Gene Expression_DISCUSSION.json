    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is shown to influence gene expression related to gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and action, particularly through the transcription factor LsERF1. Ethylene promotes the expression of genes involved in GA synthesis, which in turn reduces the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on seed germination. The data suggest a significant interaction where ethylene alters gene expression patterns to favor GA, facilitating germination processes in seeds."
