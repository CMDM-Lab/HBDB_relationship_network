    "summary": "In this context, ethene (ethylene) is linked to gene expression in the germination process of Sal seeds. The study indicates that ethylene exposure influences the expression of specific genes associated with dormancy and germination, such as LsGA2ox2 and LsNCED4. The patterns of gene expression suggest that ethylene plays a role in modulating these genes, which is critical for seed germination. The relationship is further supported by the examination of promoter regions for transcription factor binding sites, indicating a direct connection between ethylene signaling and gene expression regulation."
