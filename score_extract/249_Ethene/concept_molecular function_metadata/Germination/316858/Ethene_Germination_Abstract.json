    "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to germination through its role in regulating the biosynthesis of gibberellins (GA), which are crucial for seed germination. Ethylene promotes GA biosynthesis, enabling germination at higher temperatures, and acts as a negative regulator of abscisic acid (ABA), further facilitating the germination process. The coordinated regulation of ethylene and GA biosynthetic enzymes in lettuce seeds highlights their significant interaction in promoting germination under varying conditions."
