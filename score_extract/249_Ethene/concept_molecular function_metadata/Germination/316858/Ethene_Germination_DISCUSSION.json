    "summary": "In this context, ethene is suggested to play a crucial role in promoting germination by stimulating the biosynthesis and action of gibberellins (GA), particularly through the expression of the LsGA3ox1 gene. The interaction between ethylene and GA is posited to help overcome abscisic acid (ABA) inhibition, facilitating radicle emergence during seed germination. This indicates a significant regulatory relationship where ethylene enhances the germination process via hormonal interactions."
