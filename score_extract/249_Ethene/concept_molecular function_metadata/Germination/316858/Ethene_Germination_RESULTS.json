    "summary": "In this context, ethene (ethylene) is discussed in relation to its role in seed germination. The failure of ethylene to induce gene expression associated with germination suggests that it does not promote germination in the tested seeds. Conversely, the expression of dormancy-associated genes was higher in seeds treated with AVG compared to those imbibed in water, indicating a complex interaction between ethylene and dormancy mechanisms that ultimately affects germination outcomes."
