    "summary": "In this context, ethene is implicated in the process of seed germination, where it plays a role in promoting endosperm weakening through ethylene-related responses. Mechanical pressure, generated by the growth of the embryonic radicle/hypocotyl, stimulates these ethylene responses, leading to the induction of genes that facilitate the weakening of the endosperm cap. Thus, ethene and mechanical pressure are interconnected in the regulation of seed germination, with mechanical pressure acting as a trigger for ethylene-mediated processes."
