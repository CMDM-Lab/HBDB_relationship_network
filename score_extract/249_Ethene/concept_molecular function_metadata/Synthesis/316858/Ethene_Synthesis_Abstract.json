    "summary": "In this context, ethene is discussed in relation to its role in promoting the expression of biosynthetic enzymes for gibberellins (GA) and its interaction with abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination. Ethene's influence on the synthesis of these hormones suggests a regulatory role in the synthesis pathways that facilitate germination under varying temperature conditions. The coordinated regulation of ethylene and GA biosynthetic enzymes indicates a significant relationship between ethene and the synthesis of these hormones, particularly in the context of seed dormancy and germination."
