    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) plays a crucial role in promoting the synthesis of gibberellins (GA) in lettuce seeds, which helps overcome the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on germination. Ethylene's action is linked to the stimulation of GA biosynthesis through the transcription factor LsERF1, indicating a significant relationship between ethylene and the synthesis of GA, essential for seed germination and thermotolerance."
