    "summary": "In this context, ethene is indirectly related to the synthesis process as it is involved in ethylene biosynthesis, which is crucial for seed germination. The study examines how temperature affects ethylene production and its subsequent impact on germination, indicating that ethylene synthesis is a key factor in the germination process. However, the specific synthesis of ethene itself is not the primary focus of the discussion."
