    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the regulation of gene expression associated with seed germination and dormancy. Specifically, the gene LsMAN1, which is involved in cell wall modification, is mentioned as being influenced by ethylene. This suggests that ethylene plays a role in promoting the expression of genes that facilitate changes in the cell wall necessary for seed germination, indicating a direct relationship between ethylene and cell wall modification processes during seed development."
