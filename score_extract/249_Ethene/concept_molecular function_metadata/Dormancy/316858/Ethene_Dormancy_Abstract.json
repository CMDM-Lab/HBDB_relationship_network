    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (term_A) is linked to the regulation of seed dormancy (term_B) in plants, particularly in the Compositae family. Ethylene is associated with the release of dormancy in seeds, such as lettuce and sunflower, by alleviating inhibitory effects on germination. The production of ethylene is influenced by environmental factors, and its role in promoting seed germination and overcoming dormancy is highlighted through its interaction with enzymatic activities that facilitate radicle protrusion."
