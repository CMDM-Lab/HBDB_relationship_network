    "summary": "In this context, ethylene is highlighted as a key hormone that interacts with gibberellins (GA) to regulate seed dormancy and germination. The study indicates that ethylene can counteract the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on dormancy, particularly in seeds with specific genetic backgrounds. This suggests that ethylene plays a significant role in promoting germination and overcoming dormancy, especially under conditions that would typically inhibit seed sprouting."
