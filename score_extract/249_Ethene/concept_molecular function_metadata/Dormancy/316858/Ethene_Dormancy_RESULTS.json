    "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to the regulation of dormancy in Sal seeds through its influence on gene expression. Exposure to ethylene affects germination-promoting genes and dormancy-associated genes differently. While ethylene exposure did not enhance germination, it reversed the effects of AVG on dormancy-related genes, indicating a complex relationship where ethylene plays a role in breaking dormancy but does not directly promote germination under certain conditions."
