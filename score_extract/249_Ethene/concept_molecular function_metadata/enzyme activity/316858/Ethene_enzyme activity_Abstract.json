    "summary": "In this context, ethene (ethylene) is linked to enzyme activity through its role in regulating the activity of enzymes involved in the conversion of ACC to ethylene and the subsequent effects on seed germination. Specifically, an increase in the activity of endo-Î²-mannanase (EBM), a cell wall-remodeling enzyme, is observed alongside increased ethylene production in thermotolerant lettuce genotypes. This suggests that ethylene directly stimulates enzymatic activity that facilitates radicle protrusion during germination, indicating a significant relationship between ethylene and enzyme activity in plant physiology."
