    "summary": "In this context, ethene is indirectly related to enzyme activity through its role in ethylene biosynthesis, which is influenced by temperature and can affect seed germination. The study discusses the use of aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) to inhibit the enzymatic activity of ACC synthase (ACS), a key enzyme in ethylene production. While ethene itself is not directly measured, its production and the associated enzyme activity are critical for understanding germination responses to ethylene."
