    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (often referred to as ethene) is implicated in promoting cell growth during the germination of lettuce seeds, particularly under high-temperature conditions. Ethylene enhances the activity of enzymes like endo-Î²-mannanase, which are crucial for cell wall remodeling, facilitating radicle protrusion and subsequent cell expansion. Additionally, ethylene's interaction with gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) suggests a complex regulatory role in seed germination and growth processes."
