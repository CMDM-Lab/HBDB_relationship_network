    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is implicated in promoting cell growth through its role in stimulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, specifically via the LsERF1 transcription factor. This interaction suggests that ethylene enhances embryonic cell growth, which is a known effect of GA action, thereby facilitating processes like germination and cell expansion in plant development."
