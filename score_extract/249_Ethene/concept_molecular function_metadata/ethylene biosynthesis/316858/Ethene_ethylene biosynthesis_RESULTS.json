    "summary": "In this context, ethene is directly related to ethylene biosynthesis, as the expression of genes associated with ethylene production (such as LsACO1 and LsACS1) is influenced by ethylene exposure. The study indicates that ethylene plays a crucial role in regulating germination-associated gene expression, suggesting that ethene is a key component in the biosynthesis pathway that affects seed germination and dormancy processes."
