    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is involved in the process of seed germination and dormancy regulation. The study assesses how exogenous ethylene influences the expression of various genes associated with these processes. The results indicate that ethylene plays a critical role in promoting germination recovery and regulating gene expression related to biosynthetic and regulatory pathways essential for seed development."
