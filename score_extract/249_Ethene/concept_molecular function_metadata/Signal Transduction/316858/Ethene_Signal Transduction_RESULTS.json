    "summary": "In this context, ethene is linked to signal transduction through its role in regulating seed germination. The study examines how ethylene production, influenced by AVG treatment, affects the sensitivity of different seed genotypes to ethylene concentrations. This indicates that ethylene acts as a signaling molecule, triggering germination processes in response to environmental cues."
