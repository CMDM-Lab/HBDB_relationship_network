    "summary": "In this context, ethene (ethylene) is linked to signal transduction through its role in regulating seed germination and thermotolerance in lettuce. The study highlights the involvement of ethylene signaling, particularly the lettuce homolog of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (LsERF1), in promoting gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, which counteracts the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) during high-temperature conditions. This connection illustrates how ethylene acts as a signaling molecule that influences physiological responses in plants."
