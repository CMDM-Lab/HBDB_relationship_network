    "summary": "In this context, ethylene is discussed in relation to its role in overcoming the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) on seed germination, particularly in the presence of gibberellins (GA). Ethylene appears to promote GA biosynthesis, which is crucial for germination, while inhibitors like PAC (a GA synthesis inhibitor) can block this process. The interaction suggests that ethylene and GA work together to counteract ABA's inhibitory action, highlighting a significant relationship between ethylene and the mechanisms involving inhibitors in seed dormancy and germination."
