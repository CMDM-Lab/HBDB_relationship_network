    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (term_A) is discussed in relation to its role in seed germination, particularly under high-temperature conditions. The use of inhibitors, specifically paclobutrazol (PAC), demonstrates that blocking gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis affects germination. The results indicate that ethylene's action cannot reverse the inhibitory effects of PAC, suggesting that ethylene and inhibitors interact in a complex manner during the germination process, with ethylene being essential for germination under certain conditions, while inhibitors can block this process."
