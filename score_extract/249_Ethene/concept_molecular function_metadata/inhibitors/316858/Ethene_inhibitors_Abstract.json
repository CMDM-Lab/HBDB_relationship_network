    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the regulation of seed germination under high-temperature conditions, where it interacts with the hormone gibberellin (GA) to counteract the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA). The study suggests that ethylene signaling, particularly through the ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (LsERF1), plays a crucial role in promoting germination despite elevated temperatures, indicating that inhibitors like ABA can negatively affect this process. Thus, ethylene acts as a promoter against the inhibitory effects of ABA on seed germination."
