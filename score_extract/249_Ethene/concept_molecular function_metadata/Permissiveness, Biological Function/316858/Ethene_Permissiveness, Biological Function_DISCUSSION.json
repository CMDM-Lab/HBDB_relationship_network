    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (term_A) plays a crucial role in promoting germination and thermotolerance in seeds, particularly those with PI alleles at Htg9.1. Ethylene's interaction with gibberellins (GA) helps to overcome the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA), indicating its permissive biological function in seed germination. The study highlights how ethylene alters hormonal balances to favor GA, thus facilitating germination under high-temperature conditions."
