    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is linked to the biological function of seed germination, particularly in its role as a promoter of germination recovery in specific genotypes. The permissiveness of germination is influenced by temperature and the expression of germination-associated genes, which are regulated by ethylene. The study indicates that ethylene's presence can enhance the expression of genes necessary for germination, suggesting a critical biological function in overcoming dormancy and facilitating seed germination under optimal conditions."
