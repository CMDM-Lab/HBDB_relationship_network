    "summary": "In this context, ethene (ethylene) is linked to the regulation of gene expression associated with seed germination and dormancy, which are critical anabolic processes in plant development. The presence of ethylene influences the expression of various biosynthetic genes, indicating its role in promoting anabolic pathways necessary for seed growth and recovery from dormancy. This suggests that ethylene acts as a signaling molecule that enhances anabolic processes during germination."
