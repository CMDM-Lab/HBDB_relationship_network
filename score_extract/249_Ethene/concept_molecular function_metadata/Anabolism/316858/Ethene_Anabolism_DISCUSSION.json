    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is implicated in promoting gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, which is essential for anabolism during seed germination. The data suggest that ethylene enhances the expression of genes related to GA production, thereby facilitating cell growth and overcoming the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA). This indicates a significant role of ethylene in anabolic processes associated with seed development and germination."
