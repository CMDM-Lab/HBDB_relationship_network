    "summary": "In this context, ethylene (referred to as ethene) is implicated in the regulation of seed germination and thermotolerance through its signaling pathways. The study highlights the role of ethylene in promoting gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis, which is crucial for overcoming the inhibitory effects of abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination. This suggests that ethylene signaling is linked to anabolic processes that facilitate growth and development in response to environmental stressors, such as high temperatures."
