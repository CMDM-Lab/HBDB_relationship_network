    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular are mentioned without any direct relationship or interaction. The text primarily discusses partitioning coefficients of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and does not provide any information linking 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane to autoimmune syndromes or their mechanisms. Thus, their mention appears coincidental rather than relevant."
