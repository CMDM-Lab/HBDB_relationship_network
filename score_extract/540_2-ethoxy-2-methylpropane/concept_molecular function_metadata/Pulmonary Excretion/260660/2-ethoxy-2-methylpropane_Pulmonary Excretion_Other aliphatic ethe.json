    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is discussed in relation to its metabolic byproducts, particularly TBA, which is excreted through pulmonary routes. The study highlights that a small percentage of absorbed ETBE is excreted via the lungs, indicating a connection between ETBE metabolism and pulmonary excretion. However, the focus is primarily on TBA rather than a direct examination of ETBE's relationship with pulmonary excretion."
