    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is associated with cell proliferation, particularly in the kidneys and liver of male rats and mice exposed to high concentrations. The study indicates that exposure to ETBE leads to increased labeling indices in renal tubule cells and hepatocyte hypertrophy, suggesting a mitogenic response and potential for promoting cell proliferation in these tissues. This relationship highlights the toxicological effects of ETBE and its implications for cellular growth in response to chemical exposure."
