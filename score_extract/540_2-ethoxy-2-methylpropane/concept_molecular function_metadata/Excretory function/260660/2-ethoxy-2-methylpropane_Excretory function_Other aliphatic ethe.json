    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is discussed in relation to its metabolic and excretory kinetics in humans. The urinary excretion of ETBE and its metabolite TBA is noted to be low, indicating that the body metabolizes ETBE further before elimination. This suggests a connection between ETBE metabolism and the excretory function, as the body processes and eliminates these compounds through urine, although the specific mechanisms of excretion are not detailed."
