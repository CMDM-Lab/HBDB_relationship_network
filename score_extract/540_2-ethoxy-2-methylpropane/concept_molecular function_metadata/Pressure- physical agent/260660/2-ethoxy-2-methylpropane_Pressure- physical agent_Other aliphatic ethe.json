    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a potential oxygenate for reformulated gasoline, similar to MTBE, ETBE, and TAME. The relationship to pressure as a physical agent is implied through the discussion of TAME having lower pressure than MTBE, which results in lower separation emissions. However, the direct connection between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and pressure is not explicitly detailed, making the relationship somewhat indirect."
