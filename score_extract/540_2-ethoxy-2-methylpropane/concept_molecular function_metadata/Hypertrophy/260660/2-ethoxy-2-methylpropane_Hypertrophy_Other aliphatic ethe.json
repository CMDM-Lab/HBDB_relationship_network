    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is associated with hepatocyte hypertrophy observed in mice exposed to high concentrations (5000 ppm). The study indicates that ETBE exposure leads to increased rates of hepatocyte cell proliferation and centrilobular hypertrophy, suggesting a mitogenic response in the liver. This relationship highlights the potential toxicological effects of ETBE on liver tissue, linking it to hypertrophy as a response to chemical exposure."
