    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (ETBE) is associated with degenerative abnormalities observed in male rats following inhalation exposure. Specifically, degenerative changes in testicular seminiferous tubules were noted at higher doses, indicating a potential toxic effect of ETBE. Additionally, other organ-specific changes, such as liver hypertrophy and renal cell proliferation, suggest that ETBE exposure may lead to various degenerative abnormalities in multiple organ systems."
