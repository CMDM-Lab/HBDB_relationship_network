    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) is discussed primarily in relation to its toxicological effects observed in animal studies, particularly regarding central nervous system (CNS) depression and liver weight changes. However, there is no direct mention or analysis of its impact on inspiration function or respiratory physiology. The focus remains on metabolic and toxicological outcomes rather than respiratory effects."
