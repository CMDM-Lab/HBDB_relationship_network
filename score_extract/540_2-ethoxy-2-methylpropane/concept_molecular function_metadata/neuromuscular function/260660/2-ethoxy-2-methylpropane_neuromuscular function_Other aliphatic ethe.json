    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) is associated with transient changes in neuromuscular functions as observed in a rat inhalation study. The study indicates that TAME exposure resulted in central nervous system (CNS) depression and affected neuromuscular function, although it did not lead to significant long-term functional changes or histopathological effects. This suggests a potential impact of TAME on neuromuscular function, albeit transient and not fully characterized."
