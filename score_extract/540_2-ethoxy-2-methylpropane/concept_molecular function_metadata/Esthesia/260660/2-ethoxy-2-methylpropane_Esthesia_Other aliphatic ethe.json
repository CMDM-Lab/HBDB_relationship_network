    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) is discussed in relation to its effects on the central nervous system (CNS), specifically noting that it caused significant CNS depression and transient changes in sensory perception during inhalation studies in rats. However, the term 'Esthesia' is not explicitly defined or elaborated upon in the context, making the relationship between TAME and sensory perception unclear. The mention of sensory perception suggests a potential link, but it lacks detailed exploration."
