    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is discussed in relation to its metabolic pathways involving cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly 2B1 and 2E1. The mention of 'orthologous gene' refers to the absence of the 2B enzyme in monkey microsomes, indicating a comparative analysis of metabolic functions across species. However, the relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and orthologous genes is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on enzyme activity rather than a direct connection to gene orthology."
