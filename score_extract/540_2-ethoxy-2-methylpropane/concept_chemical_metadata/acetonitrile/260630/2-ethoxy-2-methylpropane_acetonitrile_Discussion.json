    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and acetonitrile are both mentioned as organic compounds involved in the degradation processes by different cell lines, particularly in cancer research. However, their specific interactions or relationships are not detailed, and they are primarily noted for their roles in the degradation of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by different cell types. The mention of acetonitrile in relation to cancer cells suggests a potential area of study, but no direct connection to 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is established."
