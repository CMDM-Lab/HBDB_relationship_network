    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned alongside aldehydes in a discussion about the degradation of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by different cell lines. While aldehydes are noted as compounds that nontransformed cells can degrade, the specific relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and aldehydes is not elaborated upon. The context suggests a broader investigation into VOC degradation without a direct interaction or significant relevance between the two terms."
