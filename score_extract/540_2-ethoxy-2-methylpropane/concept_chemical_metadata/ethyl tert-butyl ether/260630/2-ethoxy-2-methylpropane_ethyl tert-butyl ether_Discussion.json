    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether are both mentioned as organic compounds, but their specific relationship is not detailed. The context discusses the degradation of various compounds by different cell lines, including ethyl tert-butyl ether, but does not provide a direct connection or interaction between the two ethers. They are part of a broader discussion on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their behavior in biological systems, but no significant interaction is established."
