    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as part of a study investigating the partitioning of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) between supercooled water/ice and the gas phase. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance within the study, as the focus is primarily on BTEX compounds and ethers in general rather than on the relationship between these two specific compounds."
