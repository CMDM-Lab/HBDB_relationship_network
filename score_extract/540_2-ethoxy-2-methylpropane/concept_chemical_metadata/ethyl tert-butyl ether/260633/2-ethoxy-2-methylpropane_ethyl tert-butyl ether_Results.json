    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as organic compounds analyzed under the framework of Henry's law coefficients in relation to gas chromatography (GC) responses. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance within the study, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of various compounds without a focused relationship between them."
