    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether are both mentioned in relation to partitioning coefficients and their behavior as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under varying temperature conditions. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance, as the focus is primarily on the methodology for calculating partitioning coefficients rather than on the compounds themselves."
