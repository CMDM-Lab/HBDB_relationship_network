    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned in relation to their behavior in the gas phase and their solubility characteristics compared to BTEX compounds. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships. The focus is primarily on the comparative solubility and phase behavior of these compounds rather than a detailed connection between them."
