    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to soil contamination and leachability studies. However, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between these two compounds. Instead, it discusses their behavior in the context of soil profiles and leaching rates, indicating that both are part of a broader discussion on VOCs without specific connections to each other."
