    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned in relation to their metabolism in the liver, particularly involving the P450 enzyme system. While the focus is primarily on the metabolism of MTBE, the mention of ETBE indicates a shared metabolic pathway involving CYP2A6. However, the specific relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ETBE is not elaborated upon, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed interaction."
