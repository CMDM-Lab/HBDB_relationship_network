    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as types of ether compounds used as fuel oxygenates. However, the context primarily focuses on methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and its properties, with ETBE listed among other ethers without a detailed discussion of its relationship with 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane. Their connection lies in their classification as ethers, but no specific interactions or comparative analysis is provided."
