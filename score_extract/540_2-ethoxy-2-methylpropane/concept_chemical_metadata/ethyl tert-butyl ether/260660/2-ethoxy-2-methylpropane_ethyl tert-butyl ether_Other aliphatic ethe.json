    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both discussed in relation to their toxicological effects in rat inhalation studies. While TAME is noted for causing CNS depression and increased liver weight, ETBE is mentioned as a comparative substance. However, the specific interactions or metabolic pathways between TAME and ETBE are not detailed, indicating a general connection through their classification as ethers and their studied effects on liver weight and CNS function."
