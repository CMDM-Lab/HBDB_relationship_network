    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as non-oxygenated fuel alternatives. However, the discussion primarily focuses on the economic and toxicological comparisons of various fuel additives, including ETBE and MTBE, without a direct examination of the relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and ETBE. Their mention suggests they belong to the same category of fuel additives, but no specific interactions or comparative analysis is provided."
