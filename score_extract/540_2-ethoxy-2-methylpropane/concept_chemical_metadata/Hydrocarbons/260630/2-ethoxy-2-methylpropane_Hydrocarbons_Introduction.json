    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned alongside various branched hydrocarbons released from lung cancer cell lines. While 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is an ether and not a hydrocarbon itself, it is included in a broader discussion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their relationship to cancer-derived emissions. The mention of hydrocarbons indicates a general category that includes various compounds released from the cells, but the specific relationship between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and hydrocarbons is not directly established."
