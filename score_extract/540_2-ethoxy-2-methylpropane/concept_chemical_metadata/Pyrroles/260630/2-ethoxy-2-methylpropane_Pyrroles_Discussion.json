    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and pyrroles are mentioned in relation to the degradation capabilities of different cell lines, particularly cancer cells. While 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly linked to pyrroles, the context indicates that cancer cells can degrade nitrogen-containing compounds like pyrroles, suggesting a potential area of interaction in the study of volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolism. However, the specific relationship between these two compounds is not elaborated upon."
