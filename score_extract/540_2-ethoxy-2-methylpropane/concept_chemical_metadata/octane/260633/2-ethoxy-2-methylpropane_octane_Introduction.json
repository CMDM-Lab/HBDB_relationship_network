    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and octane are both mentioned as components related to the atmospheric presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their implications in environmental pollution. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between the two compounds. They are part of a broader discussion on VOCs, particularly in relation to gasoline and its combustion products, but their individual roles or interactions are not elaborated upon."
