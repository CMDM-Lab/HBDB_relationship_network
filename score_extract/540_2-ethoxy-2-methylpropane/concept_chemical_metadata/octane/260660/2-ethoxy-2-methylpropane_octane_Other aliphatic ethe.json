    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane (TAME) and octane are both discussed in relation to their properties as fuel components and their metabolic pathways. TAME is noted for its slightly lower octane content compared to other ethers, which affects its performance as an oxygenate in fuels. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or significant relationship between TAME and octane beyond their roles in fuel chemistry."
