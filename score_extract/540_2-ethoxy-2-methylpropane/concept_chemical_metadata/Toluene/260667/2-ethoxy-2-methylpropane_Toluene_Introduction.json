    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as components of gasoline and fuel oxygenates, specifically in relation to their volatility and potential environmental impact. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their classification as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can contaminate groundwater. The focus is more on the broader implications of these compounds in fuel systems rather than a specific connection between them."
