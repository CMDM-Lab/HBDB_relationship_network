    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as contaminants whose leaching rates were analyzed in soil samples. The study compares the leaching kinetics of various contaminants, including toluene, but does not provide specific interactions or relationships between 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same analysis of leaching behavior. Their relationship is primarily based on their presence in the same experimental context rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship."
