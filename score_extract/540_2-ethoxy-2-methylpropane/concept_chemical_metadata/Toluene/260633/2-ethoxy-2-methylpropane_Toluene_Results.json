    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as organic compounds analyzed under the framework of Henry's law, which relates the solubility of gases in liquids to their partial pressures. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparisons between the two compounds, focusing instead on their individual gas chromatography (GC) responses and correlations with temperature changes. Thus, while they are part of the same study, their relationship is not explicitly defined."
