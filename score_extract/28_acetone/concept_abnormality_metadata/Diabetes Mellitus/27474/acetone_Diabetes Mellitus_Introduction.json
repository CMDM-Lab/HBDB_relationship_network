    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound that serves as a biomarker for metabolic conditions, particularly in diabetes mellitus. The liver produces acetone during ketogenesis, especially during fasting or exercise, and its levels in exhaled breath correlate with blood concentrations. This relationship highlights acetone's role in monitoring metabolic states associated with diabetes."
