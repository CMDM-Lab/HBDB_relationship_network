    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant metabolite in alveolar air, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus. Elevated acetone levels are associated with the metabolic processes occurring during lipolysis or lipid peroxidation, which are common in diabetic patients. This elevation contributes to the characteristic sweet smell of their breath, linking acetone directly to diabetes mellitus as a potential biomarker for the condition."
