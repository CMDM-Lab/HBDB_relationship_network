    "summary": "In this context, acetone is highlighted as a metabolic byproduct that varies in concentration based on dietary intake and fasting states. Notably, elevated levels of acetone are associated with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, indicating a significant relationship where acetone levels can serve as a potential biomarker for metabolic dysregulation in diabetic patients. This suggests that monitoring acetone in breath could provide insights into metabolic status in diabetes."
