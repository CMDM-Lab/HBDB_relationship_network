    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant metabolite in alveolar air, particularly elevated in conditions like diabetes mellitus, which is associated with a sweet-smelling breath. While Sweet's Syndrome is not directly mentioned, the reference to the sweet odor in diabetic patients suggests a potential link between elevated acetone levels and the syndrome, indicating a possible metabolic connection. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed."
