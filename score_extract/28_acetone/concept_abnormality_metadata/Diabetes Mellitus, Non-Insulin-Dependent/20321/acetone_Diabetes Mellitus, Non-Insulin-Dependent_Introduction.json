    "summary": "In this context, acetone is analyzed as a potential biomarker in the breath of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent). The study utilizes a particle-packed extraction needle for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to measure breath acetone levels, indicating its relevance in monitoring metabolic changes associated with diabetes. The investigation also includes urine ketone body monitoring, further supporting the connection between acetone and diabetes management."
