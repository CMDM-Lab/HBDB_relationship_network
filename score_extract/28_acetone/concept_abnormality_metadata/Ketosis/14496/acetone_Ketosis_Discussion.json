    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as one of the three types of ketone bodies produced during ketosis, particularly in conditions of starvation or heart failure (HF). The increase in free fatty acids (FFAs) leads to elevated acetyl-CoA levels, resulting in ketone body production, including acetone. While acetoacetate and Î²-hydroxybutyrate are metabolically active, acetone's volatility allows for its detection in breath, serving as a marker for ketosis. This relationship highlights acetone's role in energy metabolism during glucose scarcity, particularly in cardiac tissues."
