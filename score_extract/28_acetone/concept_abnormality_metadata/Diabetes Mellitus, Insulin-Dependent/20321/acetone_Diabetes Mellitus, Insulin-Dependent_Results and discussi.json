    "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent through its role as a potential biomarker for the disease. The study indicates that breath acetone levels increase during fasting, similar to physiological changes in insulin-dependent diabetes. Acetone is produced from the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, a ketone body measured in urine for diabetes diagnosis. This suggests that breath acetone measurement could serve as a non-invasive screening method for diabetic symptoms."
