    "summary": "In this context, acetone is evaluated as a potential biomarker for diagnosing acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The study indicates that elevated levels of acetone (EBA > 2.5 Î¼g/L) can accurately predict the clinical profile of heart failure, demonstrating a significant relationship between acetone levels and the severity of heart failure as classified by the NYHA system. This suggests that acetone may serve as a useful diagnostic tool in distinguishing between chronic heart failure and ADHF."
