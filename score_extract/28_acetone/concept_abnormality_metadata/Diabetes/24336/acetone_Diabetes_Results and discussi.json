    "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to diabetes through breath concentration measurements. Normal individuals exhibit lower acetone levels, while diabetic patients show significantly elevated acetone concentrations, indicating a potential biomarker for diabetes. The increase in acetone is attributed to lipid mobilization, which is more pronounced in diabetic conditions compared to normal fasting states."
