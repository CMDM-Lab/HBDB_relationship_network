    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) present in exhaled breath, which serves as a potential biomarker for diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Diabetic patients typically exhibit higher breath acetone concentrations compared to healthy individuals, indicating its relevance in non-invasive diabetes diagnosis. Additionally, urine analysis for ketone bodies is commonly employed in clinical settings for diabetes management."
