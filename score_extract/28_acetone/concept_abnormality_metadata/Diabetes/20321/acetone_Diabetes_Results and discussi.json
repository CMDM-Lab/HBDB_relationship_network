    "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to diabetes through its measurement in breath samples as a potential biomarker for diabetic symptoms. The study indicates that breath acetone levels are significantly higher in individuals with diabetes compared to healthy controls, particularly during fasting. Acetone is produced from the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, a ketone body associated with insulin-dependent diabetes, suggesting its relevance in non-invasive diabetes screening methods."
