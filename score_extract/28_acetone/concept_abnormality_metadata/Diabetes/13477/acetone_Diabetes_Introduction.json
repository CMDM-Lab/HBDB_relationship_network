    "summary": "In this context, acetone is highlighted as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can provide insights into the metabolic status of diabetic patients. The concentration of acetone in the breath is significantly higher in diabetics (over 1800 ppb) compared to healthy individuals (300-900 ppb). However, the relationship between breath acetone levels and blood glucose is complex, indicating that while acetone may serve as a potential biomarker for diabetes, further research is needed to establish its clinical utility."
