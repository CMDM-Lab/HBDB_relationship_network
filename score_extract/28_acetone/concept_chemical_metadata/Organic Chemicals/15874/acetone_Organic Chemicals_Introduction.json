    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a target volatile organic compound (VOC) alongside toluene and xylenes, which are categorized as organic chemicals. The study focuses on the preparation of Pt-based carbon aerogels for the adsorption and combustion of these VOCs, highlighting acetone's role as a representative oxygenated organic compound. However, the relationship is primarily based on classification rather than a detailed interaction or functional significance."
