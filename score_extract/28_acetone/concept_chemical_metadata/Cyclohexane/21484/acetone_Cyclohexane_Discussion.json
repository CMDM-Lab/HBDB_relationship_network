    "summary": "In this context, acetone and cyclohexane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were tested for their effects on skin response. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor cyclohexane produced any significant effect when applied to the skin, suggesting that they do not have a relevant interaction or impact in this specific experimental setup. Their mention is purely as part of a broader investigation into VOCs without any direct relationship or functional significance highlighted."
