    "summary": "In this context, acetone and cyclohexane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were topically applied to the skin. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor cyclohexane produced any significant skin response or dye leakage, unlike other VOCs such as formalin, m-xylene, and toluene. This suggests that both compounds were tested under similar conditions but did not exhibit any notable effects on skin response."
