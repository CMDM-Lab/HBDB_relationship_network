    "summary": "In this context, acetone is utilized as a vapor in a quartz cuvette to study its interaction with a membrane under UV/Vis spectroscopy. The quartz serves as a transparent medium that allows for the monitoring of acetone's absorbance properties, facilitating the development of a sensor for acetone detection. The relationship is primarily experimental, focusing on the physical properties of acetone in a quartz environment rather than any chemical interaction between the two."
