    "summary": "In this context, acetone is used as a cleaning agent for Empore disks prior to sampling airborne semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), while quartz fiber filter disks serve as adsorbents in the sampling process. The relationship between acetone and quartz is indirect, as acetone is utilized in the preparation of the sampling materials rather than interacting with quartz itself in a chemical or biological manner."
