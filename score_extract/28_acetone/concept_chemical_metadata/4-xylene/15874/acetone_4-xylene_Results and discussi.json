    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 4-xylene are compared in terms of their combustion reactivity on porous carbon aerogels. The study indicates that acetone exhibits significantly lower combustion efficiency (around 25%) compared to 4-xylene, which combusts completely at 180Â°C. This highlights a clear difference in the catalytic behavior and reactivity of these two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under similar experimental conditions."
