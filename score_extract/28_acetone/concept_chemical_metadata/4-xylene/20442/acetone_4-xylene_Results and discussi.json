    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 4-xylene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their adsorption properties based on their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy values. The study indicates that acetone exhibits a higher adsorption capacity than 4-xylene and other VOCs at high relative pressures, suggesting a significant difference in their interactions with the adsorption medium. This highlights the comparative behavior of these compounds in adsorption processes, particularly under varying pressure conditions."
