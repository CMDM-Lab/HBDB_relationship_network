    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that interact with the porous material MIL-101. The study discusses how the molecular dimensions of these VOCs influence their ability to enter the pores of MIL-101, with acetone and 4-xylene having different adsorption capacities based on their molecular structures. However, the specific interactions between acetone and 4-xylene are not elaborated upon, focusing instead on their individual behaviors in relation to the material's pore structure."
