    "summary": "In this context, acetone and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) are both mentioned as compounds evaluated for their response coefficients in calibration methods. The text indicates that acetone, along with ETBE and other compounds, has a response coefficient that exceeds theoretical expectations, suggesting that both compounds are relevant in the context of calibration methods for gas mixtures. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships."
