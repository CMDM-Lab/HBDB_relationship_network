    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to the overall composition of carbonyl compounds in urban emissions. The study highlights that acetone is more abundant than formaldehyde among the carbonyl compounds measured, indicating its significant presence in the atmospheric composition. This suggests a direct relationship where acetone is classified as a type of carbonyl compound, reflecting its role in urban air quality and pollution studies."
