    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 3-xylene are both discussed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with specific HOMO energy values influencing their adsorption capacities. The study indicates that acetone exhibits a higher adsorption capacity than 3-xylene and other VOCs at high relative pressures, suggesting a comparative analysis of their adsorption behaviors. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their physical properties rather than a direct chemical interaction."
