    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tested for their effects on skin response after topical application. However, acetone did not produce any significant skin response or dye leakage, unlike 3-xylene, which was part of a group that induced a dose-dependent response. This indicates that while both are VOCs, their biological effects differ significantly in this experimental setup."
