    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant volatile organic compound present in human breath, while other ketones, such as butanone and 2-propanone, are mentioned as being present in much smaller quantities. The discussion highlights the need for accurate detection of acetone and its potential interference with the measurement of other ketones. This indicates a relationship where acetone serves as a primary focus in breath analysis, while other ketones are secondary and less significant in concentration."
