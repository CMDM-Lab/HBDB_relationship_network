    "summary": "In this context, acetone and esters are mentioned in relation to the structural and functional characteristics of bacterial proteins, particularly in the context of substrate binding and molecular scaffolding. Acetone is referenced as a methyl ketone, which contrasts with the ester group in O-methylglycine. However, there is no direct discussion of how acetone interacts with esters or their biological significance together, limiting the depth of their relationship."
