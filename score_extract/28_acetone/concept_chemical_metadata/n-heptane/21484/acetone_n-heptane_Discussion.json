    "summary": "In this context, acetone and n-heptane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were tested for their effects on skin response. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor n-heptane produced any significant effect when applied to the skin, suggesting that they do not have a relevant interaction or impact in this specific experimental setup. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than any direct relationship."
