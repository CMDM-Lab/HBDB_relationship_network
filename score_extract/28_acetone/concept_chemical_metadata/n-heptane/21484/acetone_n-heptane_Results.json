    "summary": "In this context, acetone and n-heptane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) applied topically to assess their effects on skin response. However, the study indicates that neither acetone nor n-heptane produced any significant skin response or dye leakage, suggesting that they do not have a notable interaction or effect in this experimental setup. Their mention is primarily as part of a broader investigation into the effects of various VOCs on skin permeability."
