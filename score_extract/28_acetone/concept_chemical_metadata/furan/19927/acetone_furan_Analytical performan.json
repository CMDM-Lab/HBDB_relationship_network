    "summary": "In this context, acetone and furan are both mentioned as compounds evaluated for their response coefficients in calibration methods. They are compared to theoretical response coefficients, with both showing superior performance. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interaction or functional relationship between acetone and furan beyond their inclusion in the same analysis."
