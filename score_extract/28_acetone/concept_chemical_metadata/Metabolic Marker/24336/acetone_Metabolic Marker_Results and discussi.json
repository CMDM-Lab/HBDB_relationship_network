    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant metabolic marker produced by hepatocytes during fasting, specifically through the decarboxylation of excess Acetyl-CoA. The study highlights that fasting leads to a substantial increase in acetone levels in expired air, indicating its role as a physiological marker of metabolic state. The relationship is underscored by the quantifiable increase in acetone concentration with prolonged fasting, demonstrating its relevance in metabolic monitoring."
