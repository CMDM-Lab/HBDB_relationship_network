    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant intermediate product formed during the decomposition of toluene. As the aromatic ring of toluene breaks down, acetone is produced, which is then further fragmented into various organic by-products, including ketene. This indicates a direct chemical relationship where acetone is a precursor to ketene in the degradation pathway of toluene."
