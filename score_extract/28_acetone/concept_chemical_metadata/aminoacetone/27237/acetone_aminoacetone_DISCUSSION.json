    "summary": "In this context, acetone and aminoacetone are related through their structural similarities, as aminoacetone is described as differing from O-methylglycine only by the substitution of the ester group with a methyl ketone, which is a characteristic of acetone. The discussion highlights the binding mode of aminoacetone in relation to the SoAAO protein, suggesting a biochemical connection between the two compounds, particularly in the context of enzyme interactions and substrate specificity."
