    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the category of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The study highlights that acetone exhibits a higher adsorption affinity on PCH compared to aromatic compounds, indicating its significant role in adsorption mechanisms. The analysis emphasizes the importance of various parameters, including the HOMO energy values, in influencing the adsorption capacities of VOCs like acetone, which is classified as an aliphatic hydrocarbon."
