    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a significant intermediate product formed during the decomposition of toluene, which contains carbon. The study indicates that approximately 40% of the carbon content in acetone originates from the breakdown of toluene's aromatic ring. This highlights a direct relationship where toluene's degradation leads to the formation of acetone, linking both terms through their chemical transformation processes."
