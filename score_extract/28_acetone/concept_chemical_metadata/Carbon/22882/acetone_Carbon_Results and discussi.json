    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its adsorption properties on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphitized carbon. The study indicates that acetone forms stronger interactions with MWCNTs compared to other chemicals, as evidenced by the significant adsorption enthalpy values. This suggests a notable chemical relationship between acetone and carbon-based materials, particularly in terms of adsorption dynamics."
