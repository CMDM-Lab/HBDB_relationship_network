    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as compounds that exhibit linear responses during sampling at high relative humidity (RH). The study highlights their behavior in relation to the trapping capacity of humid air, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the analysis of volatile organic compounds under varying humidity conditions. However, the specific interaction or relationship between acetone and acetaldehyde is not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework."
