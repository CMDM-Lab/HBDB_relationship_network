    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the urban area of Douai. The study highlights their concentrations, with acetone being more abundant than acetaldehyde. Both compounds show a correlation with traffic emissions, indicating they are part of the same environmental monitoring effort, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between them is discussed."
