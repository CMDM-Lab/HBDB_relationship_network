    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both quantified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ambient air samples, with acetone showing a higher average concentration than acetaldehyde. The analysis indicates that both compounds are influenced by emissions from motor vehicles, although acetone exhibits a different temporal trend compared to acetaldehyde. This suggests a potential relationship in their sources and environmental behavior, but no direct interaction or metabolic relationship is discussed."
