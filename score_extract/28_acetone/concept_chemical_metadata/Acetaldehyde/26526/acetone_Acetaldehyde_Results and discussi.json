    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are both identified as products of atmospheric photochemistry, with acetone being the most abundant species observed at the sampling sites, significantly higher than acetaldehyde. Their concentrations are linked through the processes that govern their formation and degradation in the atmosphere, indicating a direct relationship in terms of their chemical behavior and environmental presence."
