    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are mentioned as volatile compounds associated with the quality of highland coffee. While both compounds are linked to the overall quality and fruity character of the beverage, the context does not provide a direct interaction or specific relationship between them. Instead, they are presented as indicators influenced by climatic conditions during seed development, suggesting a broader connection to coffee quality rather than a direct chemical relationship."
