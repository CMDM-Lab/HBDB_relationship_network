    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetaldehyde are connected through the decomposition pathways of toluene. Acetone is identified as a major intermediate formed from the breakdown of toluene, which subsequently fragments into other organic by-products, including acetaldehyde. This indicates a direct chemical relationship where acetone is a precursor to acetaldehyde in the degradation process of toluene, highlighting their interdependence in the chemical reactions described."
