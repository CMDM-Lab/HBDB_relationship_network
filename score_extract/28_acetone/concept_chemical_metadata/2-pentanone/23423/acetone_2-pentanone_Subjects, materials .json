    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 2-pentanone are both analyzed as compounds in a calibration study for quantification in breath and environmental samples. They are part of a list of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at various concentrations, but there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions or specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework."
