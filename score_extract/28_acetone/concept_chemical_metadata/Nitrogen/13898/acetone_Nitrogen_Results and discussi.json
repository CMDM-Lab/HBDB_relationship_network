    "summary": "In this context, acetone and nitrogen are related through the process of VOC regeneration, where increasing temperature affects the regeneration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like acetone while simultaneously decreasing nitrogen consumption. The operational costs associated with acetone are discussed, indicating a significant interaction effect that reduces costs compared to other compounds, suggesting a functional relationship in the regeneration process."
