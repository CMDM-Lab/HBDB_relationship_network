    "summary": "In this context, acetone and nitrogen are utilized in an acetone bubbling system for in-situ studies. Nitrogen serves as a carrier gas, controlling the flow and concentration of acetone in the gas mixture. The relationship is primarily functional, where nitrogen facilitates the delivery and measurement of acetone concentrations in the experimental setup, but there is no chemical interaction between the two substances discussed."
