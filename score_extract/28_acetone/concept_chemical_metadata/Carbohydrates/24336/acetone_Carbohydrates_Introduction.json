    "summary": "In this context, acetone is highlighted as a significant compound produced in the body, primarily through metabolic processes such as lipolysis. Its concentration in breath is notably influenced by dietary carbohydrate intake, with variations observed during fasting or in response to different diets. This suggests a direct relationship where carbohydrate consumption affects acetone levels, particularly in metabolic states like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus."
