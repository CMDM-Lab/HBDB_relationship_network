    "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethylselenide are both analyzed as compounds in a calibration study for quantification in breath and environmental samples. They are included in a list of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at different concentrations, but there is no discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships. The focus is primarily on their identification and quantification methods rather than any biological or chemical relevance between the two compounds."
