    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both quantified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with varying concentration levels in the air. The data indicates that while both compounds are present in the environment, their temporal trends differ, with acetone showing higher concentrations during specific early hours compared to toluene. This suggests that their sources and emissions may not be directly correlated, highlighting distinct patterns in their atmospheric behavior."
