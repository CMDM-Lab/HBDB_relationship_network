    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are compared regarding their adsorption characteristics on carbon surfaces, influenced by the chemical nature of the adsorbent and the adsorbates. Acetone, with a higher dipolar moment, is favored for adsorption at lower carbonization temperatures due to its hydrophilic interactions, while toluene's adsorption improves with higher temperatures due to its hydrophobic nature and molecular shape, allowing better access to micropores. This highlights a significant relationship between the two VOCs in terms of their adsorption behavior under varying conditions."
