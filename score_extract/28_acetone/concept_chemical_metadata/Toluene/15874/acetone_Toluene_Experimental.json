    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both organic solvents used in static adsorption experiments to evaluate the adsorption capacity of samples. The study involves exposing samples to saturated atmospheres of either toluene or acetone, measuring their adsorption behavior under controlled conditions. However, the relationship between the two solvents is primarily procedural, focusing on their individual roles in the adsorption process rather than any direct interaction or comparison between them."
