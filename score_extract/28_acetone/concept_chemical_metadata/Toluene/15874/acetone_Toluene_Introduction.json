    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both identified as target volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used in the study of Pt-based carbon aerogels for their adsorption and combustion catalytic properties. They are mentioned together as representative examples of aromatic and oxygenated organic compounds, indicating a shared relevance in the research focus on VOCs, but without detailed interaction or comparative analysis between them."
