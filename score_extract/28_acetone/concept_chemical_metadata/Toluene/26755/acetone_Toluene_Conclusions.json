    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are directly related through the process of toluene degradation. The study indicates that toluene, when subjected to plasma conditions, primarily fragments into acetone as a major intermediate product. This relationship highlights acetone's role in the breakdown pathway of toluene, suggesting a significant connection in the context of organic by-product formation during toluene dissociation."
