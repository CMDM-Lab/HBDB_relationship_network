    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are directly related through a chemical decomposition process. The study indicates that toluene, when subjected to certain conditions, breaks down to form acetone as a significant intermediate product. The results show that acetone concentration increases as toluene concentration decreases, highlighting a clear transformation pathway where toluene contributes to the formation of acetone, which is then further decomposed into other organic by-products."
