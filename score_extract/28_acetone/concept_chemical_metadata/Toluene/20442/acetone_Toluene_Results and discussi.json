    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their adsorption properties based on their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy values. The study indicates that acetone exhibits a higher adsorption capacity than toluene at high relative pressures, suggesting a significant difference in their behavior in adsorption processes. This relationship highlights the comparative analysis of their physical properties in the context of adsorption mechanisms."
