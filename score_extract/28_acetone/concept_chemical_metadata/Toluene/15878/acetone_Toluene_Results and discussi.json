    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can enter the pores of MIL-101, a metal-organic framework. The adsorption capacity of these VOCs is influenced by their molecular dimensions, specifically the diagonal lengths of their rectangle planes. While both compounds are discussed in relation to their ability to be adsorbed, there is no detailed interaction or comparison between them beyond their shared property as VOCs entering the same material."
