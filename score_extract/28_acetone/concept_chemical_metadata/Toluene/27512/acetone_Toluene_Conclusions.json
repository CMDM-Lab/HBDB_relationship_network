    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) effectively treated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The study highlights that high removal efficiencies (REs) exceeding 93% were achieved for both compounds at low hydraulic retention times (GRTs). This indicates a significant relationship in their treatment efficiency within the same bioreactor system, showcasing their comparable behavior in the biodegradation process."
