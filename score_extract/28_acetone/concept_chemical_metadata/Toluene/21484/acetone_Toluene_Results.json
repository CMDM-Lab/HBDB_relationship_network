    "summary": "In this context, acetone and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) applied topically to assess their effects on skin response. However, while toluene produced a significant dye leakage response, acetone did not show any effect on the skin response, indicating a lack of interaction or comparable biological activity between the two compounds in this specific experimental setup."
