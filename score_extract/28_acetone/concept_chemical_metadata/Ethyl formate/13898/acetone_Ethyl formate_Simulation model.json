    "summary": "In this context, acetone and ethyl formate are both mentioned as components in a system analyzed using the modified Langmuir isotherm model. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup. The focus is on the diffusion mechanisms and mass transfer resistance rather than any direct interaction or comparison between acetone and ethyl formate."
