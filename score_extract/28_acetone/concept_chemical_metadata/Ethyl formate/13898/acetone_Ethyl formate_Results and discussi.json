    "summary": "In this context, acetone and ethyl formate are discussed in relation to their operational costs and regeneration processes in a system involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The text indicates that increasing temperature affects the regeneration of these compounds, with acetone showing a significant decrease in operating costs compared to ethyl formate and dichloromethane. The simulation results for ethyl formate are also mentioned, highlighting a delay in its regeneration profile compared to acetone, suggesting a comparative analysis of their efficiencies in a specific application."
