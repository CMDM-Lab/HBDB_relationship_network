    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed as a specific chemical analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) in relation to its peak amplitude and detection sensitivity. The term 'chemicals' refers broadly to the various substances, including acetone, that are eluted and detected during the analysis. The relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the behavior of acetone as a chemical within a broader analysis of multiple chemicals in exhaled breath condensate."
