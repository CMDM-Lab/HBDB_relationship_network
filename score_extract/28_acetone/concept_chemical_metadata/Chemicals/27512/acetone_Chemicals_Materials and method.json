    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being treated in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) alongside other chemicals like toluene, limonene, and hexane. The study focuses on the performance of the MBR in treating mixtures of VOCs at trace levels, indicating that acetone is part of a broader category of chemicals being analyzed for their biodegradation and transport properties in wastewater treatment processes."
