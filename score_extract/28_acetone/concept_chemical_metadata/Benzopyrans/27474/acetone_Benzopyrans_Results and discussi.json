    "summary": "In this context, acetone is involved in a chemical reaction with resorcinol, leading to the formation of a benzopyran compound as a product. The study hypothesizes that the acid-catalyzed reaction of acetone with resorcinol results in an immobilized flavan compound, indicating a direct chemical relationship between acetone and benzopyrans. The visible color change of the membranes upon exposure to acetone further supports this interaction, suggesting that acetone plays a crucial role in the synthesis of benzopyran derivatives."
