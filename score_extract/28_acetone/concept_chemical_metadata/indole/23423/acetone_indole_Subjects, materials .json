    "summary": "In this context, acetone and indole are both analyzed as compounds in a calibration study for quantification in breath and environmental samples. The study details the concentrations used for each compound and the methodology for their identification and quantification. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between acetone and indole, as they are treated as separate entities in the calibration process."
