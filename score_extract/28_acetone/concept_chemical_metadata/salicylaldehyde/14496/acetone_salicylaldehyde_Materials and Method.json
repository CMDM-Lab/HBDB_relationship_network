    "summary": "In this context, acetone and salicylaldehyde are connected through a chemical analysis process where acetone is quantitatively determined after reacting with salicylaldehyde. The study highlights the method of identifying acetone in aqueous extracts using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indicating a direct analytical relationship between the two compounds in the context of measuring acetone levels."
