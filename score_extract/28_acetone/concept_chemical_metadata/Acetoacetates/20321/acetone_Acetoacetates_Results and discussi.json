    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetoacetates are related through their roles in metabolic processes, particularly in the context of diabetes. Acetone is produced from the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, a ketone body. The study highlights the significance of measuring breath acetone as a noninvasive method for screening diabetic symptoms, linking the presence of acetone in breath to the metabolic state associated with acetoacetates during fasting conditions."
