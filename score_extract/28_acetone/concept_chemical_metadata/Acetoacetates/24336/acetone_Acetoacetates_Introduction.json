    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetoacetates are related through metabolic processes, specifically in the context of lipolysis. Acetone is produced from the decarboxylation of acetoacetate, which is a key intermediate in the metabolism of fatty acids. This relationship highlights the physiological significance of acetone as a byproduct of fat metabolism, particularly during fasting or starvation when acetoacetate levels increase due to enhanced lipolysis."
