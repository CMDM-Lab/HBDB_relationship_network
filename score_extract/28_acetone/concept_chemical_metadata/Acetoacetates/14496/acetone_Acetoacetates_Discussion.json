    "summary": "In this context, acetone and acetoacetates are both products of ketone body metabolism, which occurs during conditions like heart failure (HF) and starvation. Acetoacetate and Î²-hydroxybutyrate are the primary active ketone bodies, while acetone is a volatile byproduct that can be detected in breath. The production of these ketone bodies is linked to increased free fatty acid levels and serves as an alternative energy source during glucose scarcity, highlighting their interconnected roles in metabolic processes."
