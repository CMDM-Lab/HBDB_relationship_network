    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a representative member of ketones, while toluene is noted as a representative of aromatic compounds within a mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being treated in a biotrickling filter (BTF). The study aims to evaluate the performance of the BTF on various VOCs, including both ketones and aromatic compounds, but does not detail any specific interactions or relationships between acetone and aromatic compounds beyond their classification within the mixture."
