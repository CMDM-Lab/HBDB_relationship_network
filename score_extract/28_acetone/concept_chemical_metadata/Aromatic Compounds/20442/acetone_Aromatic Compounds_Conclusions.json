    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) with a higher adsorption affinity for PCH compared to aromatic compounds. The study highlights that the adsorption mechanisms of VOCs are influenced by various parameters, with acetone, an aliphatic hydrocarbon, demonstrating distinct characteristics that differentiate it from aromatic compounds. This suggests a significant contrast in how these two classes of compounds interact with the adsorption medium."
