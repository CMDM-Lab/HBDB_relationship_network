    "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethyl trisulfide are both analyzed as compounds in a calibration study for quantification in breath and environmental samples. They are included in a list of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured at different concentrations, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between them. Their mention is primarily related to their quantification methods rather than any biological or chemical interaction."
