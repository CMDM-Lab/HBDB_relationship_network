    "summary": "In this context, acetone is highlighted as a volatile organic compound that correlates with blood glucose levels, particularly in the management of diabetes. The study indicates that breath analysis for acetone can provide a more effective diagnostic tool for monitoring diabetic conditions compared to traditional blood glucose measurements. The strong correlation between blood acetone and glucose levels suggests that acetone may serve as a biomarker for metabolic states related to glucose regulation."
