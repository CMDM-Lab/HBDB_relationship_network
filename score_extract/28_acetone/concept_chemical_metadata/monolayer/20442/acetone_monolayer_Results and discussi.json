    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its adsorption characteristics during the monolayer phase of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The adsorption capacity of acetone is noted to be higher than that of BTEX compounds in this phase, indicating a strong interaction between acetone and the adsorbent. The relationship is quantitatively assessed through the adsorption potential and amount adsorbed, demonstrating that acetone's behavior in the monolayer phase is significant in understanding its adsorption dynamics compared to other VOCs."
