    "summary": "In this context, acetone and aldehydes are both mentioned as components of non-methane hydrocarbons (TNMHC) and carbonyl compounds analyzed in air samples. Acetone is categorized as an oxygenated volatile organic compound (OVOC) that may be partially recovered during sampling, similar to aldehydes. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or specific relationship between acetone and aldehydes beyond their classification as compounds measured in the same study."
