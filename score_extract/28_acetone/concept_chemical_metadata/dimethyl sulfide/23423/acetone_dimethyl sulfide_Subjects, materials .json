    "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethyl sulfide are both analyzed as compounds in a calibration process for quantification in breath and environmental samples. They are part of a broader study involving various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between acetone and dimethyl sulfide beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework. Their relationship is limited to being part of the same measurement process without further biological or chemical significance."
