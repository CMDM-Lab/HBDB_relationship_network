    "summary": "In this context, acetone and dimethyl sulfide are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in alveolar and mouth air samples from volunteers. The study highlights a significant difference in concentrations between these two types of air, indicating that both compounds are present and correlated in breath samples. However, the specific interactions or functional relationships between acetone and dimethyl sulfide are not elaborated upon, focusing instead on their individual concentrations and correlations with other compounds."
