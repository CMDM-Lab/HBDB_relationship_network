    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 1-propanol are both volatile organic compounds measured in alveolar and mouth air samples from volunteers. A significant difference in concentration was noted between alveolar and mouth air for both compounds, indicating their presence in breath analysis. However, the correlation between acetone and 1-propanol was weak (R â‰¤0.33), suggesting limited direct interaction or relationship in terms of their metabolic or physiological significance despite being part of the same study."
