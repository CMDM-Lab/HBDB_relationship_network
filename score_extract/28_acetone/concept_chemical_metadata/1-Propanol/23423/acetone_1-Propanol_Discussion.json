    "summary": "In this context, acetone and 1-Propanol are both mentioned as volatile compounds detected in breath samples, with their concentrations being close to the normal range established in previous studies. The discussion focuses on the challenges of measuring these compounds accurately due to methodological issues, but does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between acetone and 1-Propanol. Their mention is primarily in the context of breath analysis and odor detection thresholds."
