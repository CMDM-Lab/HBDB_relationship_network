    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic solvent that demonstrates significant solubility for the synthesized block copolymers, specifically poly(l-Asp-g-DEAP)-b-PEG and poly(l-Asp-g-DOCA)-b-PEG. The study highlights acetone's role as a solvent in evaluating the solubility of these organic polymer products, indicating its importance in the formulation and application of these materials."
