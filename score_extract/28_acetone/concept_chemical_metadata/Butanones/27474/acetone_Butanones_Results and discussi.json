    "summary": "In this context, acetone and butanones are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds present in human breath. While acetone is highlighted for its significant levels and the focus of the study, butanones (including butanone and 2-propanone) are noted to be present in much smaller quantities. The study emphasizes the need to calibrate detection systems for acetone while acknowledging the presence of butanones, indicating a relationship based on their classification as ketones but lacking detailed interaction or functional significance."
