    "summary": "In this context, acetone and zeolites are compared in terms of their adsorption capacities for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights that MIL-101, a metal-organic framework, exhibits superior adsorption capacity for acetone compared to zeolites and other adsorbents. While zeolites are mentioned as commonly utilized adsorbents, the focus is on the performance of MIL-101, indicating that zeolites have a lower capacity for acetone adsorption. This suggests a relationship where zeolites serve as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of MIL-101 in removing acetone from contaminated air."
