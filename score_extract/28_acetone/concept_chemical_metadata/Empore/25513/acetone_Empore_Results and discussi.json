    "summary": "In this context, acetone is used as a cleaning agent for Empore disks, which are employed in the sampling process for semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). The washing of Empore disks with acetone is necessary to remove contaminants that may interfere with the analysis. This indicates a practical relationship where acetone serves a preparatory role in ensuring the integrity of the sampling process involving Empore disks."
