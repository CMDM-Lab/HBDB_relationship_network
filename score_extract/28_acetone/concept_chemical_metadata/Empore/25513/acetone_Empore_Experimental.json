    "summary": "In this context, acetone is used as a cleaning agent for Empore disks prior to sampling airborne semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). The Empore disks serve as adsorbents in the sampling process, while acetone is employed to ensure the disks are free from contaminants before they are utilized in the air sampling setup. This indicates a procedural relationship where acetone is essential for preparing the Empore disks for effective sampling."
