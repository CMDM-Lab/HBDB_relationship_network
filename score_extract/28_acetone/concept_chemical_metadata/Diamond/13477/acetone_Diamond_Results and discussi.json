    "summary": "In this context, acetone and diamond are related through the performance of a sensor that detects acetone and ethanol at varying temperatures. The sensor's response to acetone is significantly higher than that to ethanol, with diamond representing the sensor's response to ethanol. The selectivity of the sensor for acetone over ethanol is enhanced at higher temperatures, indicating a functional relationship in the context of gas detection technology."
