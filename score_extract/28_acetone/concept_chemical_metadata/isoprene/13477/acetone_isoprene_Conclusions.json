    "summary": "In this context, acetone and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to breath analysis. The study highlights the ability of sensors to monitor breath acetone concentrations effectively, while also noting the presence of isoprene, which is associated with physical activity. However, the relationship between acetone and isoprene is not deeply explored, as the focus is primarily on the sensor's performance in detecting acetone, independent of isoprene's influence."
