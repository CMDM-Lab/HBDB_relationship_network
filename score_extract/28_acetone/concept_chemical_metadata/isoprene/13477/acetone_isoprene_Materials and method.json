    "summary": "In this context, acetone and isoprene are both measured as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during breath analysis using a medical ergometer. The signals for acetone and isoprene are quantified at specific mass-to-charge ratios, indicating their presence in the breath samples of healthy subjects. However, the context does not elaborate on any direct interaction or functional relationship between acetone and isoprene beyond their simultaneous measurement."
