    "summary": "In this context, acetone and isoprene are both measured as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath samples during physical activity. While acetone concentrations remained relatively stable, isoprene levels increased significantly, indicating a distinct physiological response to exercise. The presence of isoprene did not affect the measurement of acetone, suggesting that these compounds can be monitored independently in breath analysis, highlighting their different metabolic pathways during physical exertion."
