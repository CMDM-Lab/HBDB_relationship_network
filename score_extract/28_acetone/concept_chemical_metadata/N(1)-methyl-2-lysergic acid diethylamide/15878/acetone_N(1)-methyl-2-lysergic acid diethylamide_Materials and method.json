    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) involved in vapor-phase adsorption measurements, while N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide (commonly known as LSD) is not directly referenced in relation to acetone. The context primarily focuses on the thermal stability and adsorption characteristics of MIL-101, with acetone being one of the substances analyzed. There is no evident interaction or relationship between acetone and LSD in the provided information."
