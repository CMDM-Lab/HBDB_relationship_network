    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can enter the pores of MIL-101, a metal-organic framework, based on its molecular dimensions. However, N(1)-methyl-2-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is not discussed in relation to acetone or the adsorption process. Therefore, there is no direct or implied relationship between acetone and LSD in this context."
