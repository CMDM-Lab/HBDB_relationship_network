    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that reacts with ozone in gas-phase reactions. The study indicates that ozone effectively reduces the concentration of acetone, with the reaction rate being significantly enhanced when ozone is introduced intermittently, increasing by approximately 4.4 times. This highlights a direct chemical interaction where ozone acts as a reactive agent towards acetone, contributing to the transformation and degradation of VOCs in the atmosphere."
