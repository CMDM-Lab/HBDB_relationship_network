    "summary": "In this context, acetone is described as a polar molecule that exhibits specific adsorption behaviors influenced by physical pressure. The text highlights that the adsorption capacity of acetone on a particular adsorbent (PCH) increases with higher equilibrium concentrations and pressures, indicating a significant interaction between acetone's dipole characteristics and the physical pressure applied during adsorption processes. This relationship emphasizes how physical agents like pressure can affect the adsorption dynamics of polar molecules such as acetone."
