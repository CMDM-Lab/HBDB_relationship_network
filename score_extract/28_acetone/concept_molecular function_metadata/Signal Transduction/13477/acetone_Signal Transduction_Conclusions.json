    "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using sensors that exhibit high signal-to-noise ratios, indicating effective signal transduction for breath analysis. The sensors' ability to detect low concentrations of acetone and respond rapidly to breath pulses highlights their role in monitoring acetone levels, which is relevant for physiological assessments. However, the relationship between acetone and signal transduction is primarily focused on the measurement technology rather than a direct biochemical interaction."
