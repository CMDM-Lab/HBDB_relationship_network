    "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using a sensor that detects its concentration in breath samples. The sensor's response is influenced by the presence of other species, indicating a complex interaction during signal transduction. However, the relationship between acetone and the broader concept of signal transduction is not explicitly detailed, focusing instead on the sensor's performance and response characteristics."
