    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its detection using chemo-resistive gas sensors made from semiconductor nanoparticles. While the sensors exhibit high sensitivity and selectivity to acetone, the term 'Signal Transduction' is not explicitly defined or connected to acetone's detection mechanism. The focus is primarily on the technical aspects of sensor development rather than any biological or physiological signaling pathways involving acetone."
