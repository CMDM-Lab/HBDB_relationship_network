    "summary": "In this context, acetone is highlighted as a significant volatile organic compound (VOC) in human breath, primarily formed through the dehydrogenation of isopropanol and the decarboxylation of acetoacetate. This indicates a direct biochemical relationship where dehydrogenation is a key metabolic process contributing to the production of acetone, particularly during states of lipolysis and fasting."
