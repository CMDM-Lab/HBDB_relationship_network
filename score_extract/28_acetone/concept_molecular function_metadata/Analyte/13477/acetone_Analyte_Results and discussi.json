    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its detection and measurement using a sensor, where it is compared to ethanol as an analyte. The sensor's response to acetone is highlighted as being significantly higher than that to ethanol, indicating acetone's selectivity in breath analysis. The study emphasizes the importance of operating temperatures for optimal sensor performance, particularly in distinguishing acetone from ethanol, which is a potential interfering analyte during breath measurements."
