    "summary": "In this context, acetone is directly related to the catalyst as it is the substrate undergoing combustion in the presence of the nanocrystalline Cu 0.13Ce 0.87O y catalyst. The study highlights the catalyst's improved activity and stability for acetone combustion, indicating a significant functional relationship where the catalyst facilitates the conversion of acetone at elevated temperatures. The performance of the catalyst is evaluated based on its ability to achieve total acetone conversion, demonstrating a clear and critical interaction between the two terms."
