    "summary": "In this context, acetone is analyzed for its retention efficiency during collection and subsequent chemical analysis, while 'Adjudication' refers to the statistical analysis methods used to interpret the data. The relationship between acetone and adjudication is indirect, as acetone is a subject of measurement, and adjudication pertains to the evaluation of the collected data rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship."
