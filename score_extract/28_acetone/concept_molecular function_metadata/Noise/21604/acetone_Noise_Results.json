    "summary": "In this context, acetone is analyzed in relation to its peak amplitude and signal-to-noise ratios during gas chromatography experiments. However, the term 'Noise' is mentioned in a statistical context regarding the signal-to-noise ratios but lacks a direct relationship with acetone's chemical properties or biological significance. The focus is primarily on the experimental setup rather than any interaction between acetone and noise."
