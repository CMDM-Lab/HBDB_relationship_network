    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its detection using chemo-resistive gas sensors made from semiconductor nanoparticles. The term 'noise' refers to the signal-to-noise ratio, which is crucial for accurately detecting low concentrations of acetone in breath analysis. The high signal-to-noise ratio indicates that the sensors can effectively differentiate acetone from other components like ethanol and water vapor, enhancing detection reliability. However, the challenges in developing portable devices for acetone detection due to temperature management and concentration profiles are also highlighted."
