    "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using a sensor that exhibits a specific response to its concentration in breath samples. The mention of 'noise' refers to the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor, indicating the clarity of the acetone measurement amidst potential interference from other breath components. While both terms are present, their relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the sensor's performance rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction between acetone and noise."
