    "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured using sensors that exhibit high signal-to-noise ratios, indicating the reliability of acetone detection amidst background noise. The high signal-to-noise ratio (>10) ensures that acetone concentrations can be accurately monitored, even in varying conditions, highlighting the importance of noise management in breath analysis technology. However, the relationship between acetone and noise is primarily technical, focusing on measurement accuracy rather than a biological or chemical interaction."
