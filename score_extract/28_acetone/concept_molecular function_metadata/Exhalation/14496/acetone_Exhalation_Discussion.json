    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as one of the ketone bodies produced during lipolysis in heart failure (HF) patients. Its volatility allows for the detection of ketosis through exhalation, making it a useful biomarker for monitoring metabolic states in these patients. While acetone is not metabolized by the liver, its presence in exhaled breath serves as an indicator of energy substrate availability during glucose scarcity, linking it directly to the physiological process of exhalation in the context of HF."
