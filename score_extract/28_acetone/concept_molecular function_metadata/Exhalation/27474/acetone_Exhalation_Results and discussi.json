    "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to exhalation through its presence in the breath of diabetics, where specific concentrations of acetone are targeted for study. The research investigates how varying concentrations of acetone affect the properties of a resorcinol-imbibed membrane, which changes color upon exposure, indicating a measurable response related to acetone levels typically found in exhaled breath. This suggests a direct relevance of acetone in breath analysis for potential diagnostic purposes."
