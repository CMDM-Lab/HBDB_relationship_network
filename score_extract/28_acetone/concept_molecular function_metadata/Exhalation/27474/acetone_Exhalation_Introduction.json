    "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to exhalation through the development of an optical sensing method for detecting acetone in exhaled breath. The study highlights the use of NafionÂ® membranes to create selective optodes that can identify acetone levels, indicating its relevance as a biomarker in breath analysis. This suggests a direct application of acetone detection in physiological monitoring."
