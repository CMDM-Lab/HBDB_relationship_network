    "summary": "In this context, acetone is analyzed in relation to exhalation through a novel sensor device designed for breath acetone monitoring. The study highlights the sensor's ability to detect acetone levels in exhaled breath, emphasizing the importance of measuring end-tidal concentrations to accurately reflect blood-borne volatile species. The relationship is significant as it demonstrates the potential for noninvasive monitoring of acetone in respiratory analysis."
