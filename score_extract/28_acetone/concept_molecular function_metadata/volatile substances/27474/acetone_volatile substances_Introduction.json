    "summary": "In this context, acetone is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that serves as a biomarker for various metabolic conditions. It is produced in the liver during ketogenesis, particularly in states of fasting, exercise, or diabetes mellitus. Acetone is exhaled and its presence in breath is indicative of metabolic processes, linking it directly to the broader category of volatile substances that are relevant in physiological and biochemical assessments."
