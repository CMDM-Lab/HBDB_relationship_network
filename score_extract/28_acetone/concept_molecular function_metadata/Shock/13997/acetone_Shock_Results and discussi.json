    "summary": "In this context, acetone is evaluated in relation to the performance of a biotrickling filter (BTF) under shock load conditions, where the inlet volatile organic compound (VOC) loading rate is varied rapidly. The study assesses how acetone, along with other VOCs, affects the overall removal efficiency (RE) of the BTF during these shock conditions. The results indicate that acetone's removal efficiency is impacted by sudden changes in loading, highlighting its role in the system's response to shock loads."
