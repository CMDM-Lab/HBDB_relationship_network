    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its physical properties, particularly its high vapor pressure at 298K, which contributes to its greater adsorption capacity compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like toluene and xylenes. The relationship highlights how acetone's low boiling point and high vapor pressure influence its behavior in adsorption processes, making it a significant factor in the study of VOCs and their interactions with adsorbents."
