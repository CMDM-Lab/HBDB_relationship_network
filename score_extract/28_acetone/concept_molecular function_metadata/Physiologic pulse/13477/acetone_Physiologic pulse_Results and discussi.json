    "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured in breath samples, and the physiologic pulse refers to the breath pulses captured by sensors. The study highlights the sensor's ability to detect acetone concentration changes in breath pulses, indicating a relationship where acetone levels can be monitored through breath analysis. However, the connection is primarily about measurement rather than a direct physiological interaction."
