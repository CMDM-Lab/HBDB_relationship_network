    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned in relation to carbonyl concentrations measured at various locations, but it was excluded from the aloft carbonyl summations due to suspect measurements. The discussion focuses on the overall carbonyl concentrations and their comparison across different sites, with acetone not being a significant contributor to the summation of carbonyls due to limited and unreliable data."
