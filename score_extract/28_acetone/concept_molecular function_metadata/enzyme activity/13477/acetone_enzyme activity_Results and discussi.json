    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its sensing properties in a semiconductor device, where the catalytic activity of the WO3 surface is influenced by temperature. However, there is no direct mention of enzyme activity or its relationship with acetone. The focus is primarily on the sensor's response to acetone rather than any biochemical interactions involving enzymes."
