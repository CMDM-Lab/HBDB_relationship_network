    "summary": "In this context, acetone is involved in a chemical process where its concentration is monitored during reactions with ozone. The study highlights the reduction in acetone levels over time, indicating its reactivity and the efficiency of the process. The results suggest that the reaction process can be optimized by adjusting the method of ozone injection to enhance acetone degradation, demonstrating a clear relationship between acetone and the process of ozone reaction."
