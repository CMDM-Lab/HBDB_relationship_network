    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tested for their effects on skin response and dye extravasation. However, acetone did not produce any significant skin response or dye leakage, unlike other VOCs such as formalin, m-xylene, and toluene, which induced a dose-dependent extravasation effect. This indicates that acetone does not have a relevant relationship with extravasation in the tested conditions."
