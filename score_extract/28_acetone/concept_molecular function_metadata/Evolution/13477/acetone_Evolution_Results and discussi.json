    "summary": "In this context, acetone is measured in breath samples to assess its concentration during physical activity, showing a stable evolution compared to isoprene, which increases with activity. The study highlights the robustness of the Si:WO3 sensor in tracking acetone levels, indicating its potential for monitoring metabolic changes during exercise. However, the term 'Evolution' is not explicitly defined in relation to acetone, making the connection somewhat vague."
