    "summary": "In this context, acetone is involved in a study focused on developing a sensor system for its detection. The term 'evolution' refers to the changes observed in the UV/Vis spectrum as acetone vapor is continuously exposed to a membrane. The kinetics of this reaction are monitored to understand how acetone interacts with the sensor system over time, indicating a dynamic process rather than a static relationship."
