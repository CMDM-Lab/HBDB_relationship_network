    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned among other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were tested for their effects on skin responses. However, acetone did not produce any significant effect when applied, contrasting with compounds like capsaicin and formalin, which induced a response. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between acetone and obstruction in this study, as acetone's application did not lead to any observable obstruction or response."
