    "summary": "In this context, acetone is linked to physiological aspects through its role as a biomarker for metabolic states, particularly in diabetes. The study highlights that breath acetone levels increase during fasting, paralleling physiological changes in insulin-dependent diabetes. This suggests that measuring breath acetone can serve as a non-invasive method for monitoring diabetic symptoms and metabolic health, indicating its relevance in physiological assessments."
