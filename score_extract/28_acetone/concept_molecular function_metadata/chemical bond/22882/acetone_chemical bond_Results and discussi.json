    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its adsorption on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), where it is suggested that chemical bonds may be formed or broken during the sorption and desorption processes. The enthalpy results indicate that acetone interacts significantly with the MWCNTs, implying a notable relationship between acetone and chemical bonding dynamics in this specific adsorption scenario. The mention of enthalpy values further supports the idea that chemical bonds play a role in the interaction between acetone and the carbon nanotube surface."
