    "summary": "In this context, acetone is discussed in relation to its transport and biodegradation in a membrane bioreactor (MBR) system. The presence of a biofilm enhances the removal performance of acetone, indicating its biological function in the degradation process. However, the term 'Biological function, NOS' is not explicitly defined or connected to acetone's role in the study, leading to a lack of clarity regarding its specific relevance."
