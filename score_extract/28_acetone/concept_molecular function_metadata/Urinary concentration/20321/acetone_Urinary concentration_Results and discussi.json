    "summary": "In this context, acetone concentration in breath and urine is closely monitored, showing a gradual increase after fasting and a rapid decrease post-meal. The study highlights a strong correlation between breath acetone levels and urinary concentration, indicating that breath acetone can serve as a reliable marker for urinary acetone levels, particularly in the context of monitoring ketone bodies in type-2 diabetic patients."
