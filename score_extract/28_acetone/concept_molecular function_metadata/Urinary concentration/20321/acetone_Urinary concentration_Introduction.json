    "summary": "In this context, acetone is analyzed in relation to its concentration in breath and urine among controlled type-2 diabetes patients and healthy individuals. The study investigates the time variations of breath and urine acetone concentrations, indicating a potential link between breath acetone levels and urinary concentration as a biomarker for metabolic states, particularly in diabetes management. The use of urine ketone test strips further supports the relevance of urinary acetone concentration in monitoring metabolic conditions."
