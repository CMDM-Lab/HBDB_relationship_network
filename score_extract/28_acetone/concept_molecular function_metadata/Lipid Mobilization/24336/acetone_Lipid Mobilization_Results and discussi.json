    "summary": "In this context, acetone is directly linked to lipid mobilization, particularly in patients with diabetes. The increased concentrations of acetone in breath samples indicate that its production is associated with ketogenesis, a process that occurs during fatty acid oxidation. This suggests that elevated acetone levels serve as a marker for lipid mobilization and energy metabolism in diabetic individuals, highlighting its role in the metabolic state characterized by increased fat breakdown."
