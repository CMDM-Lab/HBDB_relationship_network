    "summary": "In this context, acetone is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) involved in the biodegradation process within a biotrickling filter (BTF). The study suggests that the biodegradation of acetone, along with toluene, may have triggered the secretion of monooxygenases, which are enzymes involved in the metabolic process. However, the term 'exocytosis' is not explicitly discussed or linked to acetone in the context provided, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms."
