    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to intestinal diseases through its role in the signaling pathways involving adenylate cyclase isoforms, particularly AC5 and AC6, which are expressed in colonic epithelial cells. The study discusses how nitric oxide (NO) affects adenylate cyclase activity, influencing epithelial barrier function and potentially contributing to conditions like radiation enteropathy. While AMP itself is not directly mentioned as a therapeutic target, its involvement in cAMP signaling pathways is crucial for understanding intestinal epithelial responses in disease contexts."
