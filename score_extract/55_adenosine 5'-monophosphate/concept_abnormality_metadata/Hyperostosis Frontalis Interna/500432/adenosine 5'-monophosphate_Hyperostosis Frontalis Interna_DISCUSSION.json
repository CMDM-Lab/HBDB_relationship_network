    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna (HFI) through its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly involving adenylate cyclase activity. However, there is no direct mention or exploration of HFI in relation to AMP or its metabolic pathways. The discussion primarily focuses on the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on adenylate cyclase, without establishing a clear connection to HFI."
