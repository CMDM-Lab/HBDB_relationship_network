    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is part of the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression during hypoxia, which includes the MAPK3 gene pathway. The MAPK pathway, specifically p42 and p44 MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2), is activated in response to hypoxic conditions, suggesting that AMP may play a role in modulating this signaling pathway and influencing the expression of genes regulated by MAPK3 during oxygen deprivation."
