    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is part of the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression during hypoxia in PC12 cells, which includes the MAPK pathway. The MAPK3 gene, a component of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK pathway, is likely influenced by AMP levels as part of the cellular response to hypoxic conditions. This suggests a functional relationship where AMP may play a role in modulating the activity of MAPK3 in response to hypoxia."
