    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to the ADCY5 gene through the study of adenylate cyclase expression, specifically isoform 5, which is encoded by the ADCY5 gene. The research highlights the role of adenylate cyclase in producing cyclic AMP (cAMP), a critical signaling molecule derived from AMP, and its importance in chloride secretion in the intestinal epithelium. Thus, while AMP is not directly discussed, its metabolic pathway is linked to the function of the ADCY5 gene."
