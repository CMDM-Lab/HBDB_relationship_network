    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is part of the signaling pathways that regulate gene expression during hypoxia in PC12 cells, which includes the ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. While AMP itself is not directly linked to the MAPK1 gene, it plays a role in the broader signaling network that influences MAPK pathway activation, suggesting an indirect relationship in the context of cellular responses to hypoxia."
