    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to the ADCY6 gene through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5/6, which are involved in the conversion of AMP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The immunoreactivity of AC5/6 in human intestinal epithelial cells suggests a functional role in cellular signaling pathways that may be influenced by the ADCY6 gene, although the specific relationship between AMP and ADCY6 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context."
