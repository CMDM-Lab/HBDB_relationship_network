    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to the ADCY9 gene through the discussion of adenylate cyclase isoforms, which are enzymes that convert ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The ADCY9 gene encodes one of these isoforms, suggesting a role in the regulation of AMP levels via cAMP signaling pathways. However, the specific interaction between AMP and ADCY9 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context."
