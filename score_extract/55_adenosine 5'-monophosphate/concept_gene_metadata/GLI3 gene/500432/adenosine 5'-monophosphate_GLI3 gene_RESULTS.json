    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and the GLI3 gene are not directly related. The focus is on the effects of nitric oxide (NO) donors on cGMP and cAMP levels in mouse colon and T84 cells, with no mention of the GLI3 gene or its functions. While AMP is involved in cellular signaling, the GLI3 gene is primarily associated with developmental processes and signaling pathways, particularly in the context of hedgehog signaling. Thus, their relationship is not established in this context."
