    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the metabolites of quercetin, such as isorhamnetin, which exhibit vasodilator effects. These metabolites are derived from quercetin, indicating a relationship where AMP may play a role in the metabolic pathways of these compounds. However, the specific connection between AMP and the metabolites is not explicitly detailed, limiting the strength of their relationship."
