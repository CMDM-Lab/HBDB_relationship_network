    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) is involved in the signaling pathway that regulates Ca2+ channel conductance in Rana esculenta ventricular cells. KT 5720 is mentioned as an inhibitor of protein kinase A, which decreases the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients and thus affects cAMP accumulation. This indicates a significant relationship where KT 5720 modulates the effects of cAMP on Ca2+ signaling."
