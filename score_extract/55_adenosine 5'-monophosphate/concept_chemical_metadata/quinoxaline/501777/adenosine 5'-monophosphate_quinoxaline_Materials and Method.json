    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and quinoxaline are mentioned in relation to their roles in cellular signaling pathways. Quinoxaline, specifically the compound 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), is used as a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, which may influence the signaling pathways involving AMP. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or detailed relationship between AMP and quinoxaline beyond their involvement in the same experimental setup."
