    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and quinoxaline are not directly related. The study primarily focuses on the effects of quercetin and its metabolites on vascular responses, with quinoxaline mentioned as a guanylate cyclase inhibitor. However, there is no discussion of AMP's role or interaction with quinoxaline or the vasodilatory effects observed, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms."
