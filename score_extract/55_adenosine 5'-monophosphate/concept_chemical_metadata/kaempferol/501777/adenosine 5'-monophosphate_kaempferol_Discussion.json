    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not directly mentioned in relation to kaempferol, which is discussed as a metabolite of quercetin that induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation. While AMP is a significant molecule in cellular signaling and metabolism, its specific interaction with kaempferol or its role in the vasodilatory effects of quercetin metabolites is not addressed. Therefore, the relationship between AMP and kaempferol remains unclear and indirect."
