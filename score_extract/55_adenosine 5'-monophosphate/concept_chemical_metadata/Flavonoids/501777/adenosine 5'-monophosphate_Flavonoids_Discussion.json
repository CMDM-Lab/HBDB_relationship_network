    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to flavonoids, particularly quercetin and isorhamnetin, through their effects on vascular relaxation. The study investigates the mechanisms of flavonoid-induced vasodilation, suggesting that cyclic nucleotides, including AMP, may play a role. However, the specific relationship between AMP and flavonoids is not deeply explored, indicating a moderate connection rather than a direct interaction."
