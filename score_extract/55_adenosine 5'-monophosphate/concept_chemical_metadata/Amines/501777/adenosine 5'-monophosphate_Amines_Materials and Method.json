    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and amines are mentioned in relation to physiological experiments involving perfusion pressure and various inhibitors. However, there is no direct discussion of how AMP interacts with amines or their specific roles in the experimental setup. The focus is primarily on the effects of noradrenaline and other compounds on perfusion pressure, with AMP and amines appearing without a clear relationship."
