    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to chlorides through the signaling pathways involved in ion transport and secretion in the intestinal epithelium. The study highlights that nitric oxide (NO) inhibits cAMP accumulation, which in turn affects chloride secretion mediated by adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5 and/or AC6. This suggests that AMP, as a component of the cAMP signaling pathway, plays a role in regulating chloride secretion, particularly in the context of radiation-induced secretory dysfunction."
