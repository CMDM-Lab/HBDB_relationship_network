    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to chlorides through the modulation of adenylate cyclase (AC) isoforms, specifically AC5 and AC6, which are involved in cAMP-dependent cellular responses. The study highlights the role of these isoforms in colonic chloride secretion, suggesting that AMP's influence on cAMP levels may affect chloride transport in intestinal mucosa, particularly under conditions of nitric oxide inhibition post-irradiation."
