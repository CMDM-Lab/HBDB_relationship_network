    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not directly mentioned in relation to 3-methylquercetin, which is a metabolite of quercetin known for its vasodilator effects. The study focuses on the vascular effects of quercetin and its metabolites, including isorhamnetin, but does not establish a clear connection between AMP and 3-methylquercetin. Therefore, while both terms are related to vascular physiology, their specific relationship is not discussed."
