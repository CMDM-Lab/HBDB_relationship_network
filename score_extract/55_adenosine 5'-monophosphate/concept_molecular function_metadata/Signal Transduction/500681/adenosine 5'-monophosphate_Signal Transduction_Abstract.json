    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to signal transduction through its role in the activation of adenylate cyclases, which are key enzymes in the cAMP signaling pathway. The discussion highlights how calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclases integrate signals from calcium and cAMP, indicating that AMP is a crucial component in the broader context of signal transduction mechanisms involving these pathways. However, the specific interactions of AMP with signal transduction processes are not elaborated in detail."
