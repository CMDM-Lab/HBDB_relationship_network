    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction, particularly in the regulation of cellular functions through its interaction with calcium (Ca2+) signaling. The study highlights how increases in cAMP levels are dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and are influenced by adenylate cyclase activity. This indicates that cAMP acts as a second messenger in signaling pathways, coordinating cellular responses to stimuli such as glucose and depolarization in endocrine cells."
