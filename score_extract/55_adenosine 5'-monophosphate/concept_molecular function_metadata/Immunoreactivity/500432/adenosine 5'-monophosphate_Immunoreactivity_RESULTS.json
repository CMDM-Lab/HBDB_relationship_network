    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to immunoreactivity through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms AC5/6 in a human intestinal epithelial cell line. The immunoreactivity observed indicates the presence of these isoforms, which are involved in the signaling pathways that AMP participates in. However, the specific role of AMP in relation to the immunoreactivity of AC5/6 is not explicitly detailed in the provided information."
