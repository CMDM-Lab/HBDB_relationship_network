    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (ADO) is implicated in the cellular response to hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia enhances the rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) during anoxic conditions and diminishes the inhibitory effects of ADO on calcium influx and [Ca2+]i elevation. This suggests that chronic hypoxia alters the signaling pathways involving ADO, particularly through increased A2A receptor levels and reduced protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which may help maintain cellular excitability under prolonged low oxygen conditions."
