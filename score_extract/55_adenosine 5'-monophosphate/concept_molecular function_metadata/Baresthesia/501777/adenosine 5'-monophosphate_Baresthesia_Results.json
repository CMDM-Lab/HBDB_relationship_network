    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not directly mentioned or linked to the concept of baresthesia, which refers to the perception of pressure or touch. The focus is primarily on the effects of quercetin and isorhamnetin on vascular relaxation and perfusion pressure in the thoracic aorta and mesenteric bed. There is no discussion of AMP's role in sensory perception or its relationship to baresthesia."
