    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to functional disorders through its role in cAMP signaling pathways. The study discusses how nitric oxide (NO) inhibits cAMP accumulation, affecting ion transport and chloride secretion in the intestinal epithelium. This inhibition may contribute to secretory dysfunction, which is a functional disorder, particularly in the context of radiation injury and inflammation. However, the specific role of AMP itself in these disorders is not explicitly detailed."
