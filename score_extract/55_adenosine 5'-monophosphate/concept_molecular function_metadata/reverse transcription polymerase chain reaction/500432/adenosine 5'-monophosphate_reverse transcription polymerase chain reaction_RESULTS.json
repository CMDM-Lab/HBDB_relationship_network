    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms in intestinal epithelium. The RT-PCR technique is employed to analyze the expression of these isoforms, which may be influenced by AMP levels, but the specific relationship between AMP and RT-PCR is not explicitly detailed in the provided information."
