    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the examination of adenylate cyclase expression. RT-PCR is employed as a method to analyze the expression levels of adenylate cyclase isoforms in mouse colon and human biopsies, which are relevant to AMP signaling pathways. However, the specific role of AMP in the RT-PCR analysis is not explicitly detailed, limiting the direct connection between the two terms."
