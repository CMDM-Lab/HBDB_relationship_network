    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms in mouse colonic tissues. RT-PCR is employed to analyze the expression of these isoforms, which may involve AMP as a signaling molecule. However, the specific role of AMP in the RT-PCR process or its direct relevance to the findings is not explicitly detailed."
