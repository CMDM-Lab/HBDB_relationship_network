    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to depolarization through its role in cAMP signaling. The study shows that depolarization of insulin-secreting MIN6 cells leads to a rapid increase in cAMP levels, which is dependent on extracellular Ca2+. This suggests that AMP, as a precursor to cAMP, is involved in the signaling pathway activated by depolarization, highlighting a coordinated interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in these cells."
