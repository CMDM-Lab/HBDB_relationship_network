    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to vasodilation through the discussion of cyclic nucleotides and their role in the vasodilatory effects of flavonoids like quercetin and isorhamnetin. While the study investigates the mechanisms of vasodilation, it does not explicitly link AMP to the observed effects, focusing instead on other signaling pathways. Thus, the relationship is more suggestive than direct."
