    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not explicitly mentioned, but the study focuses on the vasodilatory effects of quercetin and its metabolites on isolated vascular tissues. Vasodilation is a key physiological response that can be influenced by various signaling molecules, including AMP, which is known to play a role in vascular smooth muscle relaxation. However, the direct relationship between AMP and vasodilation is not detailed in the provided context, limiting the clarity of their connection."
