    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate cyclase activity through the discussion of cAMP levels and the functional importance of adenylate cyclase isoforms in chloride secretion. The text indicates that decreased adenylate cyclase activity is a key factor in hyporesponsiveness to secretagogues, suggesting that AMP may play a role in modulating this activity, although the direct relationship is not explicitly detailed."
