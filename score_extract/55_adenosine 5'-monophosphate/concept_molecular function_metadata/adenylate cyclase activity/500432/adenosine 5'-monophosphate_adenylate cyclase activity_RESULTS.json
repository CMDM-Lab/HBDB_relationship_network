    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate cyclase activity through the modulation of signaling pathways. The study discusses how forskolin, a known activator of adenylate cyclase, influences chloride secretion in mouse colon, while nitric oxide's effect on adenylate cyclase activity is noted as independent of Gi protein mechanisms. Although AMP is not explicitly mentioned as a direct modulator, its role as a signaling molecule in the adenylate cyclase pathway is implied, suggesting a connection in the broader context of cellular signaling."
