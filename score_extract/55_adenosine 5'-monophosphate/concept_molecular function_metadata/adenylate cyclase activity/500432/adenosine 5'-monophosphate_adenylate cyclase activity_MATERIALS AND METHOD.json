    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate cyclase activity through the measurement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, and the activity of adenylate cyclase is crucial for understanding the signaling pathways involving AMP. The study measures adenylate cyclase activity using forskolin, which stimulates cAMP production, indicating a functional relationship between AMP and adenylate cyclase in cellular signaling processes."
