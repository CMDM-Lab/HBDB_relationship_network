    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate cyclase activity through the discussion of signaling pathways involving opioid receptors and nitric oxide (NO). The text suggests that NO may influence adenylate cyclase activity, which is crucial for the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). While AMP itself is not directly discussed in relation to adenylate cyclase, its role as a signaling molecule in the context of cAMP production implies a connection."
