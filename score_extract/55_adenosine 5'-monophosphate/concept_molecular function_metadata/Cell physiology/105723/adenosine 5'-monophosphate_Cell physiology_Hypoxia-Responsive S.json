    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to cell physiology through its role in cellular signaling pathways influenced by calcium ions (Ca2+). The activation of various enzymes, including adenylate cyclases, is crucial for transducing Ca2+ signals into nuclear events that affect gene expression and cellular functions. While AMP is not explicitly mentioned, its involvement in energy metabolism and signaling pathways is essential for understanding cell physiology, particularly in relation to gene expression and cellular responses to stimuli."
