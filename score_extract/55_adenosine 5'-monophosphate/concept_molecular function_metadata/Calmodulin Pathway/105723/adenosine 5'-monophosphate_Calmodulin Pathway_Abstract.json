    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to the Calmodulin pathway through its involvement in cellular signaling during hypoxia. The Calmodulin pathway is one of several signaling pathways mentioned that regulate gene expression in response to reduced oxygen levels. While AMP is part of the broader signaling landscape, the specific interaction between AMP and the Calmodulin pathway is not detailed, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct relationship."
