    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is mentioned as part of the signaling pathways involved in the cellular response to hypoxia, specifically within the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. The Calmodulin pathway is also identified as a significant signaling route that regulates gene expression during hypoxia. While both pathways are implicated in the cellular response to low oxygen levels, the context does not provide a direct interaction or detailed relationship between AMP and the Calmodulin pathway, indicating they are part of a broader network of signaling mechanisms."
