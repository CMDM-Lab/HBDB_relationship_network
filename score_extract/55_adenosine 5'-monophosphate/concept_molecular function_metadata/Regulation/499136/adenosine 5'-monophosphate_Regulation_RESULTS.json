    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to regulation through its involvement in the signaling pathways of MIN6 Î²-cells. The study focuses on the expression of adenylate cyclase (AC) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoforms that modulate cAMP levels, which are crucial for cellular responses to stimuli. While AMP itself is not explicitly discussed, its role as a signaling molecule in regulating cAMP concentrations is implied, highlighting its importance in the broader regulatory mechanisms of cellular signaling."
