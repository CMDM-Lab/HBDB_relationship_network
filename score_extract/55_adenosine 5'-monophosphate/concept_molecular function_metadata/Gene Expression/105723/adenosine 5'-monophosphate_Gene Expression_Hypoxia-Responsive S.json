    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to gene expression through its role in cellular signaling pathways activated by calcium ions (Ca2+). The increase in intracellular Ca2+ leads to the activation of various kinases, which subsequently influence gene expression. While AMP is not explicitly mentioned in the gene expression mechanisms, it is often involved in energy metabolism and signaling that can affect transcriptional regulation."
