    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is implicated in the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia in PC12 cells. The cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, which involves AMP, is one of several signaling pathways identified as regulators of gene expression under low oxygen conditions. This suggests that AMP plays a significant role in the cellular response to hypoxia by influencing gene expression mechanisms."
