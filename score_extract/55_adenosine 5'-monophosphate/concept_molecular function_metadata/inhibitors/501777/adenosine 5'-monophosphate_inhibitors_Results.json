    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors as the study discusses the effects of various inhibitors on vascular responses. Specifically, the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ22536 is mentioned, which would affect AMP levels by inhibiting its production from ATP. However, the context does not elaborate on the direct relationship between AMP and the inhibitors, focusing instead on their effects on vascular relaxation."
