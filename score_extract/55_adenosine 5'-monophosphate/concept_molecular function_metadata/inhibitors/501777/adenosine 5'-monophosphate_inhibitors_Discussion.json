    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors through the discussion of cyclic nucleotides and their role in vasodilation. The study mentions selective inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase, which are involved in the signaling pathways that could affect AMP levels. However, the specific relationship between AMP and the inhibitors is not directly explored, indicating a more general connection rather than a detailed interaction."
