    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors through the mention of various inhibitors affecting different pathways, including adenylate cyclase. The study involves the use of inhibitors like SQ22536, which targets adenylate cyclase, potentially influencing AMP levels and signaling pathways. However, the specific role of AMP in relation to these inhibitors is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct interaction."
