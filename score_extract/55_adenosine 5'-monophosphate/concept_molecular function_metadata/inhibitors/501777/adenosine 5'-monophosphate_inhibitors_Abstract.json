    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is not directly mentioned, but the study discusses the effects of various inhibitors, including guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase inhibitors, on vasodilator responses. While inhibitors are relevant to the signaling pathways involving AMP, the specific relationship between AMP and these inhibitors is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more indirect connection."
