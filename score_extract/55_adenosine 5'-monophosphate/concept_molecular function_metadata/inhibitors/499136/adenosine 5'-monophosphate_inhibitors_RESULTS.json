    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to inhibitors, specifically the DDA inhibitor of membrane-bound adenylate cyclases. The study discusses how secretagogue-induced cAMP production is influenced by calcium signaling and the presence of inhibitors like DDA, which affects the accumulation of cAMP in MIN6 cells. While AMP is a product of adenylate cyclase activity, the focus is on the role of inhibitors in modulating cAMP levels rather than a direct relationship between AMP and the inhibitors themselves."
