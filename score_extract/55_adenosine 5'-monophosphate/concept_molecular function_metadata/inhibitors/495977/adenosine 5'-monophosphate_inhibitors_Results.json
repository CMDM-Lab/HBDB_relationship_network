    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is involved in the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by adenylate kinase, which converts ADP to ATP. The study evaluates the effects of specific inhibitors, particularly diadenosine pentaphosphate, on adenylate kinase activity and ATP accumulation in phagosomes. The significant inhibition of ATP levels by the adenylate kinase inhibitor indicates a direct relationship between AMP and the inhibitors, highlighting the role of AMP in energy metabolism and the impact of inhibitors on this process."
