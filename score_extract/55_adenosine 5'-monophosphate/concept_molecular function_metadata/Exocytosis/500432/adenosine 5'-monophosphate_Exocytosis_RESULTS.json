    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to exocytosis through its role as a signaling molecule that can influence cAMP levels and subsequent cellular responses. The study discusses the effects of cAMP analogs like 8-Br-cAMP on colonic secretory responses, suggesting that AMP may play a role in modulating exocytosis in response to various stimuli, although the direct relationship is not explicitly detailed."
