    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to exocytosis through its role in cAMP signaling pathways. The study discusses how nitric oxide (NO) inhibits cAMP accumulation, which is crucial for ion transport and secretion processes, including exocytosis. While AMP itself is not directly mentioned as a mediator of exocytosis, its involvement in cAMP signaling suggests a potential link to the regulation of secretory functions in the intestinal epithelium."
