    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to exocytosis through its role in modulating cellular responses via cAMP signaling pathways. The study focuses on adenylate cyclase isoforms, particularly AC5 and AC6, which influence cAMP levels and subsequently affect secretagogue responsiveness in intestinal cells. While AMP itself is not directly mentioned in relation to exocytosis, its involvement in cAMP signaling suggests a potential link to exocytotic processes influenced by secretagogues."
