    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to phosphorylation through its role in the signaling pathways involving P2Y12 receptors. The study highlights impaired phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and the increase in cyclic AMP (cAMP) due to ADP, indicating that AMP's involvement in these pathways is crucial for normal platelet function and aggregation. The dysfunction in phosphorylation processes suggests a significant link between AMP levels and the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in platelet activation."
