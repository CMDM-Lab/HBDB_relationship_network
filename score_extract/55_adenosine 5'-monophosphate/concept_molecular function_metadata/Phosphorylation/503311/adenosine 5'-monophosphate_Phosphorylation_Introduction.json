    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to phosphorylation through its role in platelet function and signaling pathways. The phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is measured to evaluate the effects of ADP on platelet aggregation, which is influenced by AMP levels. This suggests that AMP may play a role in the phosphorylation processes that regulate platelet activity, particularly in the context of P2Y12 receptor signaling."
