    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to antagonists through the discussion of adenylate cyclase isoforms and their modulation by various compounds. While antagonists are mentioned in the context of differentiating the functional activities of adenylate cyclase isoforms, there is no direct interaction or specific role of AMP as an antagonist or in relation to antagonists. The focus is more on the effects of agonists and the modulation of adenylate cyclase activity rather than a clear relationship with antagonists."
