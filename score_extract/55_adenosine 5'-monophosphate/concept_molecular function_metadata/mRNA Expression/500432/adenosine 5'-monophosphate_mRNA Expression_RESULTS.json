    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to mRNA expression through the study of adenylate cyclase isoforms in intestinal epithelial cells. The expression of these isoforms is assessed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which involves mRNA derived from total RNA. While AMP is a product of adenylate cyclase activity, the specific relationship between AMP and mRNA expression is not explicitly detailed in the context provided."
