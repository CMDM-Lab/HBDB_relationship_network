    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate kinase activity through the conversion of ADP to ATP. Adenylate kinase catalyzes this reaction, which is crucial for maintaining ATP levels in cells, especially under conditions of ATP limitation. The study highlights the importance of ATP in actin assembly within phagosomes, suggesting that adenylate kinase activity is essential for ATP regeneration from ADP, which is influenced by AMP levels."
