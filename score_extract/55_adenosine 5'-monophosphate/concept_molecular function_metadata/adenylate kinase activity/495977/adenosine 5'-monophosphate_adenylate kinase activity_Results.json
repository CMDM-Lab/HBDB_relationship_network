    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate kinase activity, as adenylate kinase is responsible for converting ADP to ATP, which is crucial for cellular energy metabolism. The study highlights that adenylate kinase activity is significantly higher in permeabilized phagosomes, suggesting that AMP may play a role in the energy dynamics within these organelles. However, the direct relationship between AMP and adenylate kinase activity is not explicitly detailed."
