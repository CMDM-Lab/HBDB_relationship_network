    "summary": "In this context, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) is indirectly related to adenylate kinase activity through the conversion of ADP to ATP. Adenylate kinase (AK) facilitates this conversion, which is crucial for activating the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and stimulating actin assembly in macrophages. The process highlights the role of adenylate kinase in cellular energy metabolism and signaling pathways involving AMP and ATP."
