    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as an oxidant used in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in odour management. The process involves the generation of highly reactive oxidants, including hydroxyl radicals, which enhance the degradation of VSCs. Hydrogen peroxide's role as an oxidant is critical in facilitating these reactions, indicating its importance in the overall treatment process for odour removal."
