    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is integral to the peroxone process, which combines ozone (O3) and H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The efficiency of this process is influenced by the ratio of H2O2 to O3, highlighting its critical role in enhancing the reaction mechanisms involved in pollutant degradation. The relationship is characterized by H2O2's function as a reactant that facilitates the formation of reactive species necessary for the process to occur effectively."
