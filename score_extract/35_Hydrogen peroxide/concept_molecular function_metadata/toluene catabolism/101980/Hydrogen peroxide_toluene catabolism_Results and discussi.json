    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is involved in the degradation process of toluene, where the rate constants for both toluene catabolism and H2O2 decomposition are analyzed. The study indicates that the degradation of toluene and the decomposition of H2O2 are interrelated, with both processes being influenced by factors such as toluene gas concentration, Fe concentration, UV light intensity, temperature, and pH. The observed decrease in rate constants with increasing toluene concentration suggests a competitive or cooperative relationship between the two reactions."
