    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is identified as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during mitochondrial respiration. The generation of H2O2 is linked to the metabolic processes occurring in mitochondria, where it plays a role in redox signaling and oxidative stress responses. The relationship highlights how respiration contributes to the production of H2O2, which can influence cellular functions and signaling pathways."
