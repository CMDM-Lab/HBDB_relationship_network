    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a substrate in the measurement of peroxidase activity. The reaction involves the oxidation of guaiacol catalyzed by peroxidase in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, with the peroxidase activity defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1.0 Î¼mol of hydrogen peroxide per minute. This indicates a direct and critical relationship where hydrogen peroxide is essential for assessing peroxidase activity."
