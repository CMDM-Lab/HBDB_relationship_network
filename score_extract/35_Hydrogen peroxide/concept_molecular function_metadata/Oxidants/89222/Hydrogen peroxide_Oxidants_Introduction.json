    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is identified as one of the oxidants used in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for the removal of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in odour treatment systems. The text discusses the role of hydrogen peroxide alongside other oxidants, highlighting its function in generating highly reactive species, such as hydroxyl radicals, which are crucial for effective oxidation. This indicates a direct relationship where hydrogen peroxide is categorized as an oxidant with specific applications in environmental remediation."
