    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed as an oxidant used in reactions to oxidize volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). The study indicates that varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide influence the oxidation rates, with higher concentrations leading to increased oxidation percentages. This suggests that hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidant in chemical reactions, highlighting its role in oxidation processes."
