    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is identified as a major oxidant implicated in cataract formation, highlighting its role in oxidative damage within lens epithelial cells. The study explores the cytotoxic effects of H2O2 and its relationship with the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), indicating that H2O2 acts as a significant oxidant in cellular signaling and damage processes."
