    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is identified as a key component of Fenton's reagent, which is a mixture used for the in situ oxidation of contaminants like trichloroethylene (TCE). As an oxidant, hydrogen peroxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the oxidation capabilities of the ferrous salt in the reagent, making it effective for environmental remediation. The relationship is significant as it highlights hydrogen peroxide's function as an oxidant in the degradation process of TCE in contaminated sites."
