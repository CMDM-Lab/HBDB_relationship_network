    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as a precursor in the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°), which are classified as oxidants. The use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) involving hydrogen peroxide aims to enhance the reactivity and efficiency of oxidants in degrading volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship highlights hydrogen peroxide's role in producing powerful oxidants that can facilitate chemical reactions for VOC removal, although its stability poses challenges in practical applications."
