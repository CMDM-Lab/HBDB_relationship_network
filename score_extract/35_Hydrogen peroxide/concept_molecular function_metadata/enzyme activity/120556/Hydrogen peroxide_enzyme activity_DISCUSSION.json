    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is highlighted as a reactive oxygen species generated by enzymatic activity in various cellular compartments, including mitochondria and peroxisomes. The enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase play crucial roles in regulating intracellular H2O2 levels, indicating a direct relationship between enzyme activity and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Elevated H2O2 levels can lead to oxidative stress and potential lung injury, emphasizing the importance of these enzymes in maintaining cellular health."
