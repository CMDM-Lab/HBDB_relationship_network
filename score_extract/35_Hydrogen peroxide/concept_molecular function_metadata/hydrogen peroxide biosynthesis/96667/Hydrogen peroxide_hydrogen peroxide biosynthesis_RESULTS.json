    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is measured as a product generated by macrophages and monocytes in response to exposure to chrysotile asbestos. The study assesses the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation, indicating a direct relationship between the presence of hydrogen peroxide and its biosynthesis in the cells. The results suggest that the generation of hydrogen peroxide is influenced by the cellular environment and the genetic background of the mice, particularly in the context of oxidative stress responses."
