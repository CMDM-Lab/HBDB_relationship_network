    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a substrate in a peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation reaction. The addition of hydrogen peroxide initiates the oxidation process, which is monitored through color development. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, indicating a direct relationship where hydrogen peroxide acts as a key oxidizing agent in biochemical reactions."
