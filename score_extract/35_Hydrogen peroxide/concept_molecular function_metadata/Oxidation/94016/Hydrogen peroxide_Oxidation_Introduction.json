    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is identified as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during mitochondrial respiration and lipid oxidation. It plays a significant role in oxidative stress, where increased levels of H2O2 can lead to the oxidation of glutathione (GSH) to its oxidized form (GSSG). This oxidation process is crucial for modulating various cellular functions, including enzyme activities and protein interactions, highlighting the direct relationship between hydrogen peroxide and oxidation mechanisms within cells."
