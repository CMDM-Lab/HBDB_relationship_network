    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as a component of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that utilize hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The high reactivity of hydrogen peroxide makes it a suitable oxidant for enhancing mass transfer and degradation of VOCs, indicating a direct relationship between hydrogen peroxide and oxidation processes. The text highlights the role of hydrogen peroxide in facilitating oxidation reactions, particularly in the context of improving VOC solubility and degradation efficiency."
