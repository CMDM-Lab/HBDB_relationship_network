    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is discussed as an oxidant that can promote advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). It is compared to other oxidizing agents, such as ozone and chlorine, in terms of oxidation potential. The text highlights the role of hydrogen peroxide in oxidation reactions, particularly in the removal of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) through AOPs, indicating its significance in oxidative processes."
