    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is implicated in the degradation of phenol, specifically through the activity of peroxidases. The study indicates that while H2O2 can enhance the degradation of phenol at lower concentrations, excessive amounts lead to a decrease in the rate and yield of phenol catabolism due to the inactivation of peroxidases. This highlights a critical balance in the concentration of H2O2 for effective phenol degradation."
