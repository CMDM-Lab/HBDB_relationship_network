    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a substrate in a peroxidase reaction, where its oxidation is monitored spectrophotometrically. Ionization is indirectly related as the flame ionization detector (FID) is used in gas chromatography to analyze compounds, but there is no direct discussion of how hydrogen peroxide itself undergoes ionization in this specific reaction or analysis. The focus is primarily on the enzymatic activity involving hydrogen peroxide rather than its ionization properties."
