    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is measured in exhaled breath condensate as a non-invasive marker of oxidative stress and airway inflammation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Elevated levels of H2O2 in exhaled air correlate with disease severity and exacerbations, indicating its relevance in monitoring lung health and inflammation."
