    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is involved in a photoreactor system where its decomposition follows pseudo-zero order kinetics. This means that the rate of H2O2 decomposition is constant and independent of its concentration, which is significant for understanding the reaction dynamics in the system. The relationship is highlighted by the equation representing the rate of change of H2O2 concentration over time, indicating a clear connection between the substance and the kinetic model used to describe its reaction behavior."
