    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is implicated in axon guidance through its ability to oxidize G-actin, leading to conformational changes that may affect the integrity of F-actin filaments. These modifications can influence the biophysical properties of the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for axon guidance. The study suggests that H2O2 may act as a signaling molecule that interacts with other endogenous molecules, further supporting its role in the physiological processes related to axon guidance."
