    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is a key component of Fenton's reagent, which is utilized for the in situ oxidation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in contaminated sites. The environmental impacts of using hydrogen peroxide in this application are highlighted, as it is noted for its strong oxidation capabilities and relatively low environmental footprint compared to other oxidants. The effectiveness of this method in remediating TCE contamination is discussed, indicating both successes and limitations in various studies."
