    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is involved in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) where it competes with organic sulfur compounds for hydroxyl radicals during treatments like UV/H2O2 and Fenton. The presence of organic sulfur compounds affects the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide decomposition, leading to increased consumption of hydrogen peroxide without significant mineralization of sulfur compounds. This indicates a competitive relationship where organic sulfur compounds influence the reactivity and effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in the treatment process."
