    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is utilized as an oxidizing agent in various treatment methods, including Fenton and photo-Fenton oxidation, which involve iron chloride (FeCl2). While chlorides are mentioned in relation to the use of iron chloride, there is no direct discussion of their interaction with hydrogen peroxide or their role in the oxidation processes. The focus remains on the efficiency of oxidation treatments rather than a specific relationship between H2O2 and chlorides."
