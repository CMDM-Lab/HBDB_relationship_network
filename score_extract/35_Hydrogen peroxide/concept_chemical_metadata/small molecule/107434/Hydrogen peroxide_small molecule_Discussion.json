    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed as a reactive species that can modify the properties of small molecules, potentially enabling them to function as signaling molecules in axon guidance. The interaction between H2O2 and small molecules is highlighted, suggesting that H2O2 can influence the biophysical characteristics of the cytoskeleton and contribute to signaling pathways relevant to cellular processes. This indicates a significant relationship where hydrogen peroxide acts as a modulator of small molecules involved in physiological functions."
