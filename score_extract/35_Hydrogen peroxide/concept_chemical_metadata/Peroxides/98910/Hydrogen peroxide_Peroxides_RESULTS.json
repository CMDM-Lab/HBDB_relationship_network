    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is specifically measured as a systemic product in leaves, while peroxides refer to a broader class of compounds that includes hydrogen peroxide. The study highlights the production of hydrogen peroxide in response to submergence stress, indicating its role as a reactive oxygen species. However, the relationship is primarily focused on hydrogen peroxide without detailed exploration of other peroxides, suggesting a direct but limited connection."
