    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is involved in the peroxone process, which enhances the mass transfer of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) when combined with ozone in water. The study indicates that the presence of H2O2 facilitates the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) through ozone decomposition, which subsequently interacts with DMDS, suggesting a significant role of H2O2 in improving the efficiency of DMDS treatment in advanced oxidation processes."
