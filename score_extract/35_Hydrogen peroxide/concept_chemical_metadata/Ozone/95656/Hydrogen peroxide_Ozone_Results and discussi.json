    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone (O3) are discussed in relation to their roles in the peroxone process, which involves the generation of hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) for enhanced oxidation. The study highlights the relationship between varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and ozone, demonstrating how their interaction can significantly increase radical generation yields, thus indicating a synergistic effect in oxidative processes. This suggests that both compounds are critical in improving the efficiency of the peroxone process for environmental applications."
