    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide and ozone are discussed in relation to their roles in chemical reactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Ozone is noted for its direct molecular attack and its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) through decomposition, which can subsequently react with other compounds. The study aims to understand the kinetic constants and mechanisms of these reactions, indicating a significant interaction between ozone and hydrogen peroxide in the context of oxidative processes and pollutant degradation."
