    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ozone (O3) are utilized in a scrubber system where they are mixed in an aqueous solution to track hydroxyl radicals. The experimental setup indicates a direct interaction between H2O2 and O3, as both are involved in the generation of reactive species for analytical purposes. Their combined use suggests a synergistic effect in oxidizing pollutants, highlighting their relevance in oxidative processes."
