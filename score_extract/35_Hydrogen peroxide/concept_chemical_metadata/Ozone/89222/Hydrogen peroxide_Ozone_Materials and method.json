    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide and ozone are both evaluated for their oxidative efficiency in treating volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) under controlled experimental conditions. The study compares the effects of equal molar concentrations of both oxidants, indicating their potential roles in oxidation processes. However, the specific interactions or comparative effectiveness between hydrogen peroxide and ozone are not deeply explored beyond their use in the same experimental setup."
