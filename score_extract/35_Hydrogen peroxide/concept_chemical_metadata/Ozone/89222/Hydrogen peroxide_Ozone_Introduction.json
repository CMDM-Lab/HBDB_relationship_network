    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide and ozone are both discussed as alternative oxidants for the removal of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in odour treatment processes. They are mentioned in relation to advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) that generate highly reactive oxidants, such as hydroxyl radicals, which are effective in degrading VSCs. The text highlights their roles in promoting oxidation, suggesting a functional relationship in the context of environmental remediation."
