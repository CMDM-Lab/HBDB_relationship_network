    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is mentioned as a chemical involved in reactions with ozone and hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) in the study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship is primarily focused on the chemical interactions and kinetics involving hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals, particularly in the context of their roles in oxidation processes. However, the specific interactions of hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals are not detailed, indicating a broader chemical context rather than a direct relationship."
