    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a reagent in the photo-Fenton reaction, which is a chemical process aimed at degrading volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like toluene. The study emphasizes the role of hydrogen peroxide as a chemical necessary for initiating the degradation process, highlighting its importance in the chemical reactions involved in treating effluent gas. Thus, hydrogen peroxide is directly related to the category of chemicals used in environmental remediation processes."
