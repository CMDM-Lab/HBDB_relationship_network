    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is discussed as a potential signaling molecule involved in axon guidance. It is suggested that H2O2 can modify the properties of other endogenous molecules, enabling them to function as additional signaling molecules. This indicates that H2O2 plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in relation to the cytoskeleton and axon guidance mechanisms."
