    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized in a photo-Fenton reaction to treat toluene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) present in effluent gas. The study emphasizes the need for continuous supply of hydrogen peroxide during the degradation process of toluene, indicating a direct chemical interaction where hydrogen peroxide acts as a reagent to facilitate the breakdown of toluene in the liquid phase."
