    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is utilized as a reagent in the photo-Fenton reaction to enhance the degradation of toluene gas in a heterogeneous gas-liquid photocatalytic oxidation process. The study indicates that the presence of H2O2 improves the overall absorption and degradation rates of toluene, suggesting a direct and significant role of hydrogen peroxide in facilitating the breakdown of toluene in the liquid phase during the reaction."
