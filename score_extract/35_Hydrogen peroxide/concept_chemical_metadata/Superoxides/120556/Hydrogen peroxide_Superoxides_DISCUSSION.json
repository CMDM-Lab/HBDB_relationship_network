    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxides (O2â€“) are both identified as toxic oxygen metabolites implicated in lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are produced by activated neutrophils and other phagocytic cells through various biochemical pathways. Both species are suggested to act as molecular mediators of tissue damage, indicating a significant relationship in the context of oxidative stress and lung pathology."
