    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxides are both classified as reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed during the incomplete reduction of oxygen. While superoxides are radical species, H2O2 is a nonradical, membrane-permeable molecule that plays a distinct role in cellular signaling. The study highlights the different reactivities and lifetimes of these ROS, indicating that H2O2 can function as an efficient signaling molecule, contrasting with the more reactive and shorter-lived superoxides."
