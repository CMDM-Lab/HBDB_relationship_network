    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key component of the peroxone process, which involves the simultaneous use of ozone (O3) and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals (HO°) for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The interaction between H2O2 and O3 leads to the formation of HO°, which are crucial for the oxidative degradation of pollutants. The efficiency of the peroxone process is influenced by the ratio of H2O2 to O3, indicating a significant and direct relationship between these two substances in enhancing the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
