    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is identified as a toxic oxygen metabolite implicated in lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is produced by activated neutrophils and other phagocytic cells during inflammatory responses. H2O2, along with other metabolites like superoxide ions and hydroxyl radicals, plays a critical role in mediating tissue damage in various pathological conditions, suggesting a significant relationship between hydrogen peroxide and the broader category of metabolites involved in oxidative stress and injury mechanisms."
