    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide is utilized as a reagent in the photo-Fenton reaction, which involves the degradation of toluene in the presence of iron(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid is mentioned as a reagent, its specific role in relation to hydrogen peroxide is not detailed. The focus is primarily on the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with iron and toluene rather than a direct relationship with sulfuric acid esters."
