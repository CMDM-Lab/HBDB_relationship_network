    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals are both identified as reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during mitochondrial respiration and lipid oxidation. Their production is linked to oxidative stress and aging, indicating that both species play a role in cellular redox status and signaling. The relationship highlights their common origin and involvement in oxidative processes within cells, suggesting they may influence similar biological pathways."
