    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is indirectly related to hydroxyl radicals (HOÂ°) through their roles in chemical reactions involving ozone (O3) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The generation of hydroxyl radicals is mentioned as a consequence of ozone decomposition, which can also involve hydrogen peroxide. The study aims to understand the kinetics of these reactions, highlighting the significance of both species in oxidative processes, although their direct interaction is not explicitly detailed."
