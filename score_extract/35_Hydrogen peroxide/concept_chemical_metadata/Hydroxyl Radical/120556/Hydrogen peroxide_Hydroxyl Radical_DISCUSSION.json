    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OHâ€¢) are both identified as toxic oxygen metabolites implicated in lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are produced through various biochemical pathways activated by neutrophils and other phagocytic cells. Both species are suggested to mediate tissue damage in pathological conditions, indicating a significant relationship in the context of oxidative stress and lung injury mechanisms."
