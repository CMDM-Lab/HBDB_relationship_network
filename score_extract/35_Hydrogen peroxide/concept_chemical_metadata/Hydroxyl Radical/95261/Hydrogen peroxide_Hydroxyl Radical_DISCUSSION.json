    "summary": "In this context, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OHâ€¢) are both classified as reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed during the incomplete reduction of oxygen. While H2O2 is described as a nonpolar, membrane-permeable molecule that serves as an efficient signaling molecule, the hydroxyl radical is noted for its high reactivity. The relationship highlights the differing roles and characteristics of these ROS in cellular processes, particularly in apoptosis and signaling pathways."
