    "summary": "In this context, formonitrile and cyanides are related through the discussion of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production by bacterial cultures. While formonitrile is a nitrile compound, cyanides refer to a broader class of compounds that include HCN. The text suggests that the bacterial cultures may produce compounds that interact with HCN, but it does not provide a direct relationship between formonitrile and cyanides beyond this general connection to cyanide production."
