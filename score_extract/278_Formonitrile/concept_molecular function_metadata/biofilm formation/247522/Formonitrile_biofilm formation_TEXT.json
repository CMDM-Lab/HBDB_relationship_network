    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is not directly mentioned in relation to biofilm formation. The study focuses on the methodology for assessing biofilm formation and measuring headspace HCN concentrations in cultures. While biofilm formation is quantitatively assessed, there is no indication of how Formonitrile influences or interacts with this process, leading to a lack of direct relevance between the two terms."
