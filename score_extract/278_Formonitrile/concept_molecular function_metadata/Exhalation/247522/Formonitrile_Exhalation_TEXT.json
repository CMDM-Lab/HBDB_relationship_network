    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to exhalation through the analysis of breath samples for volatile compounds, including hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and acetone. While the study focuses on breath concentrations of various compounds, Formonitrile itself is not explicitly mentioned as being exhaled or measured, indicating a lack of direct relevance to the exhalation process."
