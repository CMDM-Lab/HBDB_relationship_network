    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is not directly mentioned, but hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a volatile compound, is discussed in relation to exhalation as a potential marker for infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study indicates that HCN was not elevated in the exhaled breath of cystic fibrosis patients with chronic BCC infection, suggesting that exhalation analysis may not be effective for detecting this infection. The relationship between Formonitrile and exhalation remains unclear, as Formonitrile is not explicitly linked to the findings presented."
