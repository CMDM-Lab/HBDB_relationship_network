    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to acidification through the production of cyanide in biofilm cultures. The acidification of these cultures appears to influence the concentration of cyanide ions, suggesting that Formonitrile may play a role in cyanogenesis under acidic conditions. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and the overall impact of Formonitrile on acidification is not thoroughly explored."
