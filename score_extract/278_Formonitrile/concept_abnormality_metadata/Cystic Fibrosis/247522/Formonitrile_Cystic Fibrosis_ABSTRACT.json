    "summary": "In this context, formonitrile is indirectly related to cystic fibrosis through the investigation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as a potential marker for Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) infections in cystic fibrosis patients. However, the study found that HCN was not elevated in the breath of these patients, indicating that formonitrile's relevance is minimal as it is not directly discussed or linked to cystic fibrosis beyond the context of infection markers."
