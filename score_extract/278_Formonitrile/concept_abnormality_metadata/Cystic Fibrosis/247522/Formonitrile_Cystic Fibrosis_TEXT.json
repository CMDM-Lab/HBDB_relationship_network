    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to cystic fibrosis (CF) through the discussion of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) as a volatile compound associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF patients. While HCN is mentioned as a marker for P. aeruginosa in exhaled breath of CF patients, Formonitrile itself is not directly discussed or linked to CF or its pathology. The focus is primarily on HCN and its implications in CF rather than on Formonitrile's role."
