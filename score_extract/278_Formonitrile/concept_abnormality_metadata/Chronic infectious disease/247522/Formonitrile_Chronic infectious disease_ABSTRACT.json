    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to chronic infectious diseases through its association with hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a compound linked to infections caused by Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the study indicates that HCN is not a reliable marker for BCC infections in cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting limited relevance of Formonitrile in the context of chronic infectious diseases."
