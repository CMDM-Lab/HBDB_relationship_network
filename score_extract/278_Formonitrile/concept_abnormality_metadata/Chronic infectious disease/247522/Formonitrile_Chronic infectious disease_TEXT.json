    "summary": "In this context, Formonitrile is indirectly related to chronic infectious disease through its association with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production by Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The study investigates HCN as a potential marker for BCC infection, which is a chronic condition in CF patients. However, Formonitrile itself is not directly discussed as a factor in the disease process, limiting the depth of the relationship."
