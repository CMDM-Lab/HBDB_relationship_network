    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to its detection in mass spectrometry (MS) where the carboxylate anion [M−H]− of LTB4 plays a crucial role in its fragmentation process. The study details how the presence of anions, particularly the carboxylate anion, is integral to the mechanism of LTB4 fragmentation, indicating a direct chemical relationship between LTB4 and anions in the context of mass spectrometric analysis."
