    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using mass spectrometry, where it is detected as a carboxylate anion [M−H]−. The study focuses on the fragmentation of LTB4 to produce specific anions (m/z 195 and 317) during the analysis process. This indicates a direct relationship between LTB4 and anions, as LTB4 is measured in its anionic form during the quantitative analysis."
