    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a ligand that plays a role in eosinophil transmigration. The study demonstrates that pretreatment with Mig reduces eosinophil migration towards LTB4, indicating that LTB4 acts as a chemoattractant ligand for eosinophils. The data suggest that LTB4's function as a ligand is significant in mediating immune responses, particularly in the context of eosinophil activity."
