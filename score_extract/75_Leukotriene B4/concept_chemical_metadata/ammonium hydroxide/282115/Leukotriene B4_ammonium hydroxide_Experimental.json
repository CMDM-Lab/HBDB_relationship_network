    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and ammonium hydroxide are mentioned as part of a study involving the measurement of LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Ammonium hydroxide is listed among the chemicals obtained for the study, but there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between LTB4 and ammonium hydroxide. Their mention is primarily related to the preparation and analysis of samples rather than any biochemical interaction."
