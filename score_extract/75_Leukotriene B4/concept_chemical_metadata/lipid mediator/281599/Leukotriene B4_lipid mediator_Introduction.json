    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a lipid mediator within the context of eicosanoids, which are bioactive compounds derived from arachidonic acid. The text explains that LTB4 is biosynthesized from arachidonic acid through specific enzymatic processes and highlights its significant role in various inflammatory responses. This establishes a direct and critical relationship between LTB4 and its classification as a lipid mediator."
