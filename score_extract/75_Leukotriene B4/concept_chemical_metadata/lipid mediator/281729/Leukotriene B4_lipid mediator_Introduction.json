    "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a member of the leukotriene family, which are inflammatory lipid mediators. The text discusses the role of leukotrienes, including LTB4, in the pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), highlighting their involvement in systemic inflammation and various inflammatory processes. This establishes a clear relationship between LTB4 and lipid mediators, as LTB4 is specifically categorized as one of these mediators that contribute to inflammation in SDB."
