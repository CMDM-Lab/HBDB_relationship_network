    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is chemically modified to create LTB4-3-APA, which includes a terminal primary amino group. This amino group serves as a spacer for coupling LTB4 to the carrier protein VP1, enhancing the immune response in mice. The relationship is significant as the amino group is essential for the chemical coupling process that facilitates the study of LTB4's immunogenic properties."
