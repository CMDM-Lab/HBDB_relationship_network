    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to its synthesis and detection in macrophages, where amines play a role in the cross-linking process of eicosanoid carboxyl groups to proteins. The use of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC) facilitates this interaction, indicating a biochemical relationship where amines are involved in the stabilization or modification of LTB4 during experimental procedures. However, the context does not elaborate on the broader implications of this relationship beyond the experimental setup."
