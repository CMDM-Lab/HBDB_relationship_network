    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to the use of carbodiimides, specifically 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide (EDAC), which is employed to cross-link eicosanoid carboxyl groups to amines in adjacent proteins. This method is used to facilitate the immunodetection of LTB4 in macrophages, indicating a direct experimental relationship where carbodiimides are utilized to enhance the study of LTB4's synthesis and localization within cells. Thus, carbodiimides play a crucial role in the experimental setup for studying LTB4."
