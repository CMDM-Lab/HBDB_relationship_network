    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases such as asthma and COPD, with its concentrations measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The relationship to 'chemicals' arises from the mention of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) systems that utilize chemicals, specifically anti-LTB4 antisera, for the detection of LTB4. However, the connection is primarily focused on the diagnostic application rather than a direct chemical interaction."
