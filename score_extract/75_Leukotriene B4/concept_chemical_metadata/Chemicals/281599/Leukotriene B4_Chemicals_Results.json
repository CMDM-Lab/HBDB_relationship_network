    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed as a chemical compound that is the target of a specific monoclonal antibody. The study highlights the synthesis of a chemical derivative of LTB4, LTB4-3-APA, which is used in immunological assays. This indicates a direct relationship between LTB4 and the broader category of chemicals, particularly in the context of antibody development and immunoassays."
