    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its unique ability to activate BK channels, which is attributed to the presence of a hydroxyl group in its hydrocarbon structure. This feature distinguishes LTB4 from other leukotrienes that lack such a polar group, thereby highlighting a specific interaction between LTB4 and hydrocarbons that facilitates channel activation. The context emphasizes the structural importance of LTB4 in comparison to other hydrocarbons and leukotrienes, suggesting a significant biochemical relationship."
