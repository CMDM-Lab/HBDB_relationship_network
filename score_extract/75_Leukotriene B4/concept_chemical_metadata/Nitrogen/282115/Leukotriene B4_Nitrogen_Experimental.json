    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, with nitrogen mentioned as part of the sample concentration process. Specifically, LTB4 concentrations are concentrated under a gentle nitrogen stream, indicating that nitrogen is used as a carrier gas during the analytical procedure. However, there is no direct biological or chemical relationship established between LTB4 and nitrogen beyond this methodological aspect."
