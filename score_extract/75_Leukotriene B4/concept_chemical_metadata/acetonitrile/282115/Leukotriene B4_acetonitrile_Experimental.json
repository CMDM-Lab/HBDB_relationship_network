    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and acetonitrile are both mentioned as part of the materials used in a study involving the measurement of LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between LTB4 and acetonitrile. Acetonitrile is listed as a solvent used in the analytical methods, while LTB4 is the target analyte of the study. Their connection is purely incidental, related to the experimental setup rather than any chemical or biological interaction."
