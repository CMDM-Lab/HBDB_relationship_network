    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed through mass spectrometry, where the carboxylate anion [M−H]− derived from LTB4 is a key component in the fragmentation process. The mass spectra indicate that the carboxylate form of LTB4 is crucial for its detection and quantification in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), highlighting a direct relationship between LTB4 and its carboxylate form in analytical chemistry methods."
