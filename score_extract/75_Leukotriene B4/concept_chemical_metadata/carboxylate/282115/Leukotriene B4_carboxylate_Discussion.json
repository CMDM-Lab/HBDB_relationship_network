    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to its fragmentation process, where the carboxylate anion plays a significant role. The detection of LTB4 involves observing product ions, particularly the carboxylate anion, which is crucial for understanding the fragmentation mechanism of LTB4 during mass spectrometry analysis. The carboxylate anion is implicated in the rearrangement and cleavage processes that characterize LTB4's behavior in the mass spectrometer."
