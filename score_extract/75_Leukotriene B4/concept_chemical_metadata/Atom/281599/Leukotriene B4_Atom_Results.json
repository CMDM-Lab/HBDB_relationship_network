    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to the development of a specific monoclonal antibody that binds to it. The term 'atom' appears in the context of describing the chemical structure of LTB4-3-APA, which includes a 5-atom aliphatic chain. However, the relationship between LTB4 and 'atom' is not directly explored beyond this structural mention, indicating a very limited connection."
