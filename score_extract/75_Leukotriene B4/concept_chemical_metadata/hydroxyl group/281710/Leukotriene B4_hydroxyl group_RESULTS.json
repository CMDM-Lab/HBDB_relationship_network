    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its docking interactions with the BK Î²1 receptor, specifically highlighting the role of its hydroxyl groups. One of the hydroxyl groups of LTB4 forms a hydrogen bond with the amino acid Thr-169, which is crucial for its binding and activation of the receptor. This interaction emphasizes the functional importance of the hydroxyl group in the biological activity of LTB4."
