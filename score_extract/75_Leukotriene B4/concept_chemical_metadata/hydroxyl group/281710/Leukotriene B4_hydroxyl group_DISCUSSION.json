    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted for its unique ability to activate the BK channel, which is attributed to the presence of a hydroxyl group in its structure. This hydroxyl group allows for potential hydrogen bonding with Thr-169, a critical interaction that distinguishes LTB4 from other leukotrienes that lack this functional group. The presence of the hydroxyl group is essential for the effective docking and activation of the BK channel, underscoring its significant role in the biological activity of LTB4 compared to other members of the leukotriene family."
