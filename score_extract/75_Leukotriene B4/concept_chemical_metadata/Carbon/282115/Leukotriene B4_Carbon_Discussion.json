    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to confirm its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The fragmentation of LTB4 involves carbon-carbon bond cleavage, indicating a direct relationship with carbon in the context of its structural analysis. The proposed mechanism highlights the role of carbon atoms in the rearrangement and fragmentation processes of LTB4, emphasizing their significance in understanding its chemical behavior."
