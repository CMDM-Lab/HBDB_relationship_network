    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its fragmentation process, which involves the formation of a cyclic diene through a series of chemical rearrangements. The mechanism highlights the structural transformation of LTB4 during analysis, indicating that the presence of diene is a significant aspect of LTB4's chemical behavior and fragmentation pathway in mass spectrometry."
