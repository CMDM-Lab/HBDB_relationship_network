    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to confirm its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The fragmentation mechanism of LTB4 involves the rearrangement and cleavage of bonds, which is influenced by protons during the ionization process. Protons play a critical role in the formation of stable anions during the fragmentation of LTB4, indicating a direct relationship between the two in the context of mass spectrometric analysis."
