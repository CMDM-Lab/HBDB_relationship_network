    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is produced by macrophages in response to MCP-1 stimulation, which is shown to occur independently of TLR4 signaling, as TLR4-deficient mice still exhibit LTB4 synthesis. This indicates that while LTB4 is a product of macrophage activation, its synthesis does not rely on TLR4, suggesting alternative pathways for its production in inflammatory responses."
