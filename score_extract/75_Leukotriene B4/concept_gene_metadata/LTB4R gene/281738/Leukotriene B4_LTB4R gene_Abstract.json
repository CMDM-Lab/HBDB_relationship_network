    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator involved in inflammatory responses, and its receptor, LTB4R1, is crucial for mediating the effects of LTB4 in leukocyte recruitment, particularly in neutrophils. The dual expression of ALOX5 and LTB4R1 in neutrophils is essential for their recruitment in inflammatory conditions, indicating a direct functional relationship between LTB4 and the LTB4R gene in the context of immune responses and inflammation."
