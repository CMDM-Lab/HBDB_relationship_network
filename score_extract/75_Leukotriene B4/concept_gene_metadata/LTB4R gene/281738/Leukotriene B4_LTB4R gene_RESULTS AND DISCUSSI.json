    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to play a crucial role in eosinophil migration, with its signaling being essential for the accumulation of eosinophils around stimuli such as C. elegans. The LTB4R gene, which encodes the receptor for LTB4, is directly implicated in this process, as evidenced by the significant reduction in eosinophil accumulation observed in Ltb4r1âˆ’/âˆ’ eosinophils. This indicates a strong functional relationship between LTB4 and the LTB4R gene in mediating eosinophil responses."
