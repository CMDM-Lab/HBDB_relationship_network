    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant chemotactic factor involved in inflammatory processes, while the LTB4R gene encodes receptors (BLT1 and BLT2) that mediate LTB4 signaling. The interaction between LTB4 and its receptors is crucial for leukocyte attraction and regulation of inflammatory responses, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and the LTB4R gene in the context of immune signaling and inflammation."
