    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to macrophage activation and inflammatory responses, while the CCL2 gene is implicated in the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is known to stimulate macrophages. Although both terms are involved in inflammatory processes, the context does not explicitly detail a direct relationship between LTB4 and the CCL2 gene, focusing instead on the measurement of LTB4 in stimulated macrophages and the role of MCP-1 in macrophage activation."
