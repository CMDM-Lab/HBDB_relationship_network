    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant mediator in neutrophil infiltration during neurogenic inflammation. The study indicates that LTB4 antagonists can effectively reduce this infiltration, suggesting their potential therapeutic role in managing inflammation. This highlights a direct relationship where LTB4 antagonists counteract the effects of LTB4 in inflammatory processes."
