    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a lipid mediator that is biosynthesized from arachidonic acid upon cell activation. This process involves the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, which is then converted into LTB4 by specific enzymes. LTB4 plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses by acting as a chemotactic factor that attracts various leukocytes, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and cell activation in immune responses."
