    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 is implicated in the process of neutrophil infiltration during inflammatory responses. The study highlights that the release of Leukotriene B4, driven by mast cells and mediated through the H4 receptor, plays a significant role in recruiting neutrophils to sites of inflammation. This suggests a direct relationship where Leukotriene B4 acts as a key mediator in promoting neutrophil influx in response to inflammatory stimuli such as zymosan and carrageenan."
