    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator that promotes neutrophil infiltration in response to substance P-induced inflammation in mouse skin. The study indicates that antagonists of LTB4 can effectively reduce neutrophil infiltration, suggesting a critical role for LTB4 in mediating inflammatory responses involving neutrophils. This highlights the direct relationship between LTB4 and neutrophil infiltration in the context of neurogenic inflammation."
