    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a key mediator in inflammatory processes, functioning through signal transduction pathways. It is produced from arachidonic acid and acts as a potent chemotactic factor for various leukocytes. LTB4 signals through G-protein coupled receptors (BLT1 and BLT2), influencing gene regulation and cellular responses, thereby playing a crucial role in immune signaling and inflammation."
