    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to play a critical role in signal transduction related to eosinophil migration and accumulation. The activation of eosinophils leads to significant LTB4 production, which is essential for their movement towards stimuli, as evidenced by the marked reduction in eosinophil accumulation in Ltb4r1âˆ’/âˆ’ eosinophils. This indicates that LTB4 signaling is a key component in the transduction pathways that govern eosinophil behavior in response to external stimuli."
