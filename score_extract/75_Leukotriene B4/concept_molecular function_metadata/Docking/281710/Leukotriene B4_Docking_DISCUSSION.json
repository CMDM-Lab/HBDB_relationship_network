    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its ability to dock onto the BK channel's sensing site, which is critical for channel activation. The presence of a hydroxyl group in LTB4 enhances its docking capability compared to other leukotrienes, which lack this feature. This unique docking ability allows LTB4 to activate the BK channel at low concentrations, highlighting its significant role in lipid-induced channel activation."
