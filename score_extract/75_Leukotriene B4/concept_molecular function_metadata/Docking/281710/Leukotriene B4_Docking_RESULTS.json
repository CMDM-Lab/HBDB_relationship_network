    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is involved in computational docking studies to understand its interaction with the BK Î²1 subunit. The docking analysis focuses on how non-activating leukotrienes bind to the LTB4-sensing site, providing insights into the molecular interactions and structural conformations relevant to LTB4's biological functions. The study highlights the significance of docking in elucidating the binding characteristics of leukotrienes, particularly LTB4, in a biological system."
