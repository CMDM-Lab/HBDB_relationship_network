    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is involved in the synthesis of a conjugate for immunogen preparation, which is crucial for generating a specific monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype) for LTB4 detection. The synthesis process includes linking LTB4-3-aminopropylamide to a carrier protein, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and the synthesis of immunological components for analytical purposes."
