    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is being studied in relation to its synthesis, specifically through the inhibition of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) using zileuton. The experimental setup aims to ascertain the specificity of LTB4 immunolabeling, indicating that the synthesis of LTB4 is a critical focus of the investigation. The use of inhibitors to prevent LTB4 synthesis highlights its importance in the study of leukocyte function and inflammatory responses."
