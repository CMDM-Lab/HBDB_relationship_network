    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in a paracrine signaling mechanism that enhances leukocyte recruitment during inflammation. The dual expression of ALOX5 and the LTB4 receptor LTB4R1 in neutrophils indicates a paracrine amplification loop, suggesting that LTB4 may facilitate communication between eosinophils and other immune cells, thereby promoting their accumulation in response to nematode infections."
