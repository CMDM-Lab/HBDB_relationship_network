    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a potent chemotactic mediator involved in inflammatory reactions in the lungs, particularly noted for its role in increasing microvascular permeability. LTB4 is produced by activated neutrophils and is linked to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, which suggests a direct relationship between LTB4 and the regulation of microvascular permeability during inflammatory responses in the lungs."
