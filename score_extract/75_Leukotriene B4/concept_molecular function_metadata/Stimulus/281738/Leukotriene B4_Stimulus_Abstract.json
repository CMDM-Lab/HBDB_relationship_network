    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a key mediator in the immune response, particularly in eosinophil accumulation during nematode infections. The production of LTB4 is triggered by various stimuli, indicating that these stimuli play a crucial role in activating leukotriene signaling pathways. This relationship underscores the importance of stimuli in regulating LTB4 production and subsequent inflammatory responses."
