    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a potent chemotactic mediator that plays a significant role in inflammatory responses within the lungs and airways. It is noted to stimulate lymphocyte migration, indicating a direct relationship where LTB4 facilitates the movement of lymphocytes during inflammatory processes. This suggests that LTB4 is crucial for the recruitment of lymphocytes, particularly in conditions characterized by inflammation such as asthma and COPD."
