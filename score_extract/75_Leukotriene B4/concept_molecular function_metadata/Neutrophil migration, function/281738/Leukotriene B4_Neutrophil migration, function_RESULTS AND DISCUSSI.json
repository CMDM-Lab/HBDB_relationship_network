    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in the migration of neutrophils, particularly in response to nematode infections. The study highlights that neutrophils produce LTB4 upon Fc receptor engagement, suggesting that LTB4 plays a significant role in mediating neutrophil migration and function during immune responses. The comparison of neutrophil and eosinophil migration further emphasizes the specific role of LTB4 in neutrophil activity."
