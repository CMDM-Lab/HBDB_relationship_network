    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is investigated as a potential biomarker for airway inflammation, particularly in response to provocation by lipopolysaccharide exposure. The study measures LTB4 levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from subjects exposed to inflammatory stimuli, suggesting a link between LTB4 elevation and inflammatory responses triggered by such provocations. However, the overall detection of LTB4 in EBC samples was low, indicating variability in its presence as a response marker."
