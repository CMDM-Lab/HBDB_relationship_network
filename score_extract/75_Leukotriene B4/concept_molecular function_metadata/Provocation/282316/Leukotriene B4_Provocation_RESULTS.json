    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is measured in exhaled breath condensates (EBCs) from subjects before and after exposure to a swine house and following LPS provocation. The study aims to assess the immunoreactivity of LTB4 in response to provocation, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for inflammatory responses triggered by environmental exposures. However, only a small number of samples showed detectable levels of LTB4, suggesting limited provocation effects in the studied population."
