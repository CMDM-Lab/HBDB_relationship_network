    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 is directly linked to increased leukotriene production in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) abnormalities. The study reports elevated levels of leukotriene B4 and suggests a potential inflammatory process contributing to poor circulation in these patients. This indicates a clear and significant relationship between the two terms, as increased production of leukotriene B4 is a measurable outcome in the studied conditions."
