    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is measured in exhaled breath as a potential biomarker in asthmatic children receiving different doses of inhaled fluticasone. While LTB4 levels are discussed in relation to asthma treatment, there is no direct mention of its impact on inspiration function or lung function parameters. The study primarily focuses on LTB4 levels without establishing a clear link to the mechanics of inspiration."
