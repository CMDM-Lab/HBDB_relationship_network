    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is primarily produced by activated neutrophils and plays a crucial role in neutrophilic inflammation. The context highlights that LTB4 levels are elevated in conditions characterized by neutrophilic inflammation, such as asthma and COPD. The study aims to measure LTB4 levels in a model of induced neutrophilic inflammation, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 production and neutrophil activity in inflammatory responses."
