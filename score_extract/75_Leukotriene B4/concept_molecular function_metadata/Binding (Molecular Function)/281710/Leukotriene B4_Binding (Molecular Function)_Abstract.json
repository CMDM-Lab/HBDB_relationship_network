    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a potent ligand for BK channels, indicating its role in binding to these ion channel proteins. The docking of inactive leukotrienes may interfere with the binding of LTB4, suggesting a regulatory mechanism in smooth muscle contractility. This highlights the importance of LTB4 in molecular binding functions related to ion channel activity and physiological regulation."
