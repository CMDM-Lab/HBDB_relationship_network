    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed for its potential binding interactions with the BK channel's steroid-sensing site. The study highlights the structural similarities between LTB4 and LCA, suggesting that LTB4 can effectively align and bind to the BK channel, leading to its activation. This indicates a significant molecular function of LTB4 in the context of binding and channel modulation."
