    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated as a mediator in substance P-induced granulocyte infiltration, which is associated with cell degranulation. The study shows that pretreatment with an LTB4 antagonist significantly reduced neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration in response to substance P, indicating that LTB4 plays a crucial role in the degranulation process of mast cells and subsequent granulocyte recruitment in the skin."
