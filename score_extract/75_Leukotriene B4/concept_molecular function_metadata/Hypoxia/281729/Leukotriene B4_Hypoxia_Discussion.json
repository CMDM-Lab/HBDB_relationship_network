    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is linked to hypoxia through its role in regulating neutrophil survival and recruitment during intermittent hypoxia/reoxygenation events, such as those seen in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). LTB4 promotes the accumulation of neutrophils in circulation, which correlates with the severity of SDB, suggesting that hypoxia may enhance the inflammatory response mediated by LTB4, leading to systemic neutrophilic inflammation in affected children."
