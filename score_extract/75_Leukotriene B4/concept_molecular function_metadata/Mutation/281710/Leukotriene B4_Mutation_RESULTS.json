    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is investigated for its role in activating BK channels, specifically in relation to mutations in the Î²1 subunit of these channels. The study highlights that certain mutations, such as T169A, prevent LTB4 from inducing channel activation, indicating that the mutation directly affects the channel's response to LTB4. This suggests a critical relationship where the mutation alters the functional interaction between LTB4 and the BK channel, emphasizing the importance of specific residues in LTB4 sensing."
