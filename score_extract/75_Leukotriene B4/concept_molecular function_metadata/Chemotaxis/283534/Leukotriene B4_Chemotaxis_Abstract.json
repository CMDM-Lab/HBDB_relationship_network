    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator that promotes the infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into mouse skin, particularly in response to substance P. The study highlights LTB4's role in initiating inflammatory responses, suggesting that antagonists targeting LTB4 could be beneficial in managing neurogenic inflammation. This establishes a clear and direct relationship between LTB4 and chemotaxis, as LTB4 is directly involved in the chemotactic process for immune cell migration."
