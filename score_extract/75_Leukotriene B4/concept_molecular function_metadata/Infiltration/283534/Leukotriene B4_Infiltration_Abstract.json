    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator that promotes the infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils into mouse skin in response to substance P. The study demonstrates that pretreatment with an LTB4 antagonist effectively reduces this infiltration, indicating a direct role of LTB4 in mediating inflammatory responses. This suggests that LTB4 is crucial for initiating and sustaining the infiltration of these immune cells during neurogenic inflammation."
