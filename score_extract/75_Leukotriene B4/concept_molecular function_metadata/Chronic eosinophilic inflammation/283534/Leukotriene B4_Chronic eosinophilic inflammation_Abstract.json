    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator involved in the infiltration of eosinophils into mouse skin during neurogenic inflammation. The study indicates that LTB4 antagonists may help prevent eosinophil infiltration, suggesting a direct role of LTB4 in chronic eosinophilic inflammation. This highlights the potential therapeutic implications of targeting LTB4 in conditions characterized by eosinophilic inflammation."
