    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is assessed for its immunoreactivity in exhaled breath condensates (EBCs) from subjects exposed to a swine house and LPS provocation. The study measures LTB4 levels, indicating its presence and potential role as a biomarker in inflammatory responses. However, only a small fraction of samples showed detectable LTB4 immunoreactivity, suggesting limited expression under the conditions tested."
