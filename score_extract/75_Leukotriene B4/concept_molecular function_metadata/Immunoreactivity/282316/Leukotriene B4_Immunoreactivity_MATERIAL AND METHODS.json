    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is studied for its stability in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and saliva, with a focus on measuring its immunoreactivity over time. The research involves adding synthetic LTB4 to saliva and assessing the immunoreactive levels at various intervals, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 and its immunoreactivity as a measurable parameter in the study."
