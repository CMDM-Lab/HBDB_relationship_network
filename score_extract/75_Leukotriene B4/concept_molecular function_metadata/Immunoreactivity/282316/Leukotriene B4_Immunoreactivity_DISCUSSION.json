    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is assessed for its immunoreactivity in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. The study indicates that LTB4 levels can decrease over time, with a noted drop in immunoreactivity after three weeks of storage. This suggests a direct relationship between LTB4 and its immunoreactivity, highlighting the importance of timely analysis for accurate measurement of LTB4 in clinical settings, particularly in relation to respiratory conditions like asthma and rhinitis."
