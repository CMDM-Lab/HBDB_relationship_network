    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in relation to respiratory physiology, particularly in asthmatic children. The study measures exhaled LTB4 levels to assess inflammation and response to fluticasone treatment. Elevated LTB4 levels in steroid-na√Øve asthmatic children suggest its role in respiratory pathophysiology, although no correlation with lung function or other respiratory markers was found."
