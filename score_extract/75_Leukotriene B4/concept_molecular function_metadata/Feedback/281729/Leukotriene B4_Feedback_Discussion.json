    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is described as playing a crucial role in the feedback mechanisms that regulate neutrophil survival and recruitment during systemic inflammation, particularly in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). LTB4 induces a positive feedback autocrine pathway that enhances neutrophil survival, contributing to their accumulation in circulation. This feedback loop is significant in understanding the inflammatory response and the persistence of neutrophils in SDB, highlighting LTB4's role in mediating these processes."
