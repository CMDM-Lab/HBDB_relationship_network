    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in the amplification of inflammatory responses, particularly in the recruitment of leukocytes such as neutrophils and eosinophils during parasite infections. The dual expression of ALOX5 and the LTB4 receptor LTB4R1 in neutrophils creates a paracrine amplification loop, enhancing the inflammatory response. This suggests that LTB4 plays a critical role in amplifying the immune response to infections, particularly in the context of eosinophil accumulation associated with multicellular endoparasites."
