    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed as an important inflammatory mediator that activates BK channels, suggesting a potential interaction with other drugs that may target these channels. The findings imply that LTB4 could influence drug efficacy or safety through its interactions with cholane steroids, indicating a relevant area for further exploration in drug interactions involving LTB4."
