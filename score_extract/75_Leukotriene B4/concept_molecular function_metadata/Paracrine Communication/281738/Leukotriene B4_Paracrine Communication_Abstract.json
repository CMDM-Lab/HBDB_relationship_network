    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in paracrine communication, particularly in the recruitment of neutrophils during inflammatory responses. The dual expression of ALOX5 and the LTB4 receptor LTB4R1 in neutrophils establishes a paracrine amplification loop, indicating that LTB4 acts as a signaling molecule that enhances local immune responses. Additionally, the potential for similar paracrine signaling between eosinophils is suggested, highlighting the broader role of LTB4 in mediating intercellular communication in inflammation."
