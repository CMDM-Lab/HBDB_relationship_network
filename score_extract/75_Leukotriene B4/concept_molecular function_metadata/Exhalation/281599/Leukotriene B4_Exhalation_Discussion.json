    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its detection in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The use of monoclonal antibodies, specifically mAb S27BC6, is highlighted as a means to enhance the reliability of LTB4 measurements in EBC. This suggests a direct connection between LTB4 and exhalation, as the detection method aims to improve the accuracy of measuring this biomarker in breath samples."
