    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with various inflammatory diseases, including asthma and COPD. The presence of increased LTB4 levels in EBC suggests its role not only in leukocyte attraction but also as a potential diagnostic parameter for pulmonary diseases, emphasizing the relevance of exhalation as a non-invasive sampling method for assessing LTB4 concentrations."
