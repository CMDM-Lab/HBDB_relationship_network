    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed for its stability in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and saliva. The study indicates that LTB4 levels remain stable in EBC for 24 hours at room temperature and for over three months when frozen. This suggests that LTB4 can be reliably measured in exhaled breath, highlighting its potential as a biomarker in respiratory studies."
