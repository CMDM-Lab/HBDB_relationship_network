    "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is detected in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, but its presence is attributed to saliva contamination rather than being a direct marker of airway inflammation. The study suggests that while LTB4 can be found in exhaled breath, it may not be a reliable indicator for monitoring airway conditions due to this contamination issue. Thus, the relationship between LTB4 and exhalation is significant but complicated by the influence of saliva."
