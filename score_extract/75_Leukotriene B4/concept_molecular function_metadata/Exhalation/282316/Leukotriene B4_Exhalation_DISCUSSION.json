    "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath condensate, suggesting that its detection may be influenced by salivary contamination rather than originating solely from the lower airways. The study highlights the complexities of measuring LTB4 in exhaled air and indicates that the levels reported may not accurately reflect true differences in recovery from the airways, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of exhalation and salivary contributions."
