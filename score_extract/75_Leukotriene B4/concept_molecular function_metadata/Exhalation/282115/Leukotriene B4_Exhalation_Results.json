    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is measured in exhaled breath samples from different groups of children, including asthmatic and non-asthmatic individuals. The study investigates the levels of exhaled LTB4 to assess its potential role as a biomarker for asthma severity and treatment response. Elevated exhaled LTB4 values were noted in steroid-na√Øve asthmatic children, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 levels and exhalation in the context of asthma management."
