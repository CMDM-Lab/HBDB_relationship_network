    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a potent chemoattractant that enhances the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells at inflammatory sites. This function is crucial for the recruitment of inflammatory cells, indicating that LTB4 plays a significant role in promoting cell adhesion and sustaining neutrophil accumulation in conditions like sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The relationship is underscored by the correlation between elevated neutrophil levels and the severity of SDB, suggesting that LTB4-mediated cell adhesion is integral to the inflammatory response in this condition."
