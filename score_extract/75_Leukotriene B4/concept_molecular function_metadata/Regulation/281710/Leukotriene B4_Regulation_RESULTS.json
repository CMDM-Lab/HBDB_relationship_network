    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is involved in the regulation of BK channel activity, which is influenced by intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i). The study indicates that LTB4's effect on BK channel activation is dependent on specific calcium concentrations, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where LTB4 modulates channel activity based on calcium availability. This highlights the importance of LTB4 in the regulation of ion channels in response to calcium signaling."
