    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to activate BK channels through direct interaction with the BK Î²1 subunit, indicating a specific targeting mechanism. The high potency of LTB4 in activating these channels at physiologically relevant levels suggests that it plays a significant role in regulating smooth muscle contractility via targeted interactions with BK channels, highlighting its importance in vascular physiology."
