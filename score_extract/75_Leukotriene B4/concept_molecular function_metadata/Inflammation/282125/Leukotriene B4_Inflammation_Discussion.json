    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a pro-inflammatory eicosanoid whose levels are elevated in response to inflammation, particularly in the context of colon tissue analysis. The study suggests that increased LTB4 levels correlate with inflammation and carcinogenesis, indicating its role in mediating inflammatory responses. The relationship is further supported by the observation that treatments affecting inflammation also influence LTB4 levels."
