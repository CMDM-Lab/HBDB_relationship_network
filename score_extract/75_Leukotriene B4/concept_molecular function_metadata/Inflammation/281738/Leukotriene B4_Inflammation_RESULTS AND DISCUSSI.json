    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant mediator in the inflammatory response, particularly in the recruitment of eosinophils during inflammation. The study demonstrates that LTB4 facilitates the accumulation of eosinophils around nematodes, indicating its role in promoting inflammatory cell migration. Additionally, the use of a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor (MK886) further supports the connection between LTB4 and inflammation, as it prevented eosinophil accumulation, underscoring LTB4's critical role in the inflammatory process."
