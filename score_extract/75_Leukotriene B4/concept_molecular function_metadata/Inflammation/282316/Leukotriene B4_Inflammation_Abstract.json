    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a key mediator in the inflammatory response, primarily produced by activated neutrophils and macrophages. It plays a significant role in recruiting neutrophils, increasing microvascular permeability, and stimulating lymphocyte migration, particularly in conditions characterized by neutrophilic inflammation such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and COPD. The context highlights elevated LTB4 levels in subjects with these inflammatory diseases, indicating its direct involvement in the inflammatory process."
