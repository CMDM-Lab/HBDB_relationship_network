    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed as an eicosanoid that can be quantified in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using LC/MS/MS techniques. The analysis of LTB4 is relevant for assessing airway inflammation, as its concentrations may indicate the degree of inflammatory response in patients. The study highlights the challenges in quantifying LTB4 in healthy subjects and those with mild airway inflammation, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for inflammation severity in respiratory conditions."
