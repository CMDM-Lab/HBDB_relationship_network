    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is mentioned as a mediator involved in eosinophil responses, particularly in the context of asthma. The study highlights that Mig, an inhibitor, blocks LTB4-induced responses in eosinophils, indicating that inhibitors like Mig can modulate the effects of LTB4 on eosinophil activation and function. This suggests a significant relationship where inhibitors can directly impact the signaling pathways activated by LTB4."
