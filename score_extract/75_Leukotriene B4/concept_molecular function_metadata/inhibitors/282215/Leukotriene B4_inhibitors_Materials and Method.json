    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is studied in relation to its synthesis and detection in leukocytes, with a specific mention of inhibitors that block its production. The use of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton demonstrates a direct relationship, as it prevents the synthesis of LTB4, indicating that inhibitors play a crucial role in modulating LTB4 levels during the experimental procedures. This highlights the importance of inhibitors in the study of LTB4's biological functions and its implications in inflammatory responses."
