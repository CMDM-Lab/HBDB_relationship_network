    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a mediator involved in substance P-induced granulocyte infiltration in the skin. The study demonstrates that the use of LTB4 inhibitors effectively reduces neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration in response to substance P, indicating a significant role of LTB4 in this inflammatory process. The findings suggest that LTB4 inhibitors can modulate the inflammatory response mediated by LTB4, highlighting their potential therapeutic relevance in conditions characterized by granulocyte infiltration."
