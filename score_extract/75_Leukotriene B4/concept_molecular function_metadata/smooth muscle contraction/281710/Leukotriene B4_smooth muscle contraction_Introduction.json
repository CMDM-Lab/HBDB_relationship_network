    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to activate BK channels, which are involved in regulating smooth muscle contraction. The study highlights that LTB4 interacts with BK channels at physiologically relevant levels, suggesting a significant role for LTB4 in modulating smooth muscle contractility through this mechanism. The findings indicate a potential cross-talk between leukotrienes and cholane steroids in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle function."
