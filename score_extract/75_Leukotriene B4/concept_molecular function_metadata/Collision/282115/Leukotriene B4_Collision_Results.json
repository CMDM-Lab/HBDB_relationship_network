    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed using mass spectrometry, where collision-induced decomposition is a critical step in identifying and quantifying LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The process involves fragmenting LTB4 ions to produce specific product ions, which are then monitored for accurate measurement. The relationship between LTB4 and collision is thus integral to the analytical method employed for its detection."
