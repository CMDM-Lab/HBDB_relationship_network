    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed through mass spectrometry, where its fragmentation is influenced by collisional activation. The study details how collisional processes lead to specific product ions, indicating that collision plays a critical role in the fragmentation and identification of LTB4 in the analysis. This relationship highlights the importance of collision in understanding the structural behavior of LTB4 during mass spectrometric analysis."
