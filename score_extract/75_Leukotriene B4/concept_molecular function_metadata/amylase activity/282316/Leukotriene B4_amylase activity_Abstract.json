    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and amylase activity are both measured in saliva samples from healthy subjects. The study investigates LTB4 levels in response to exposure to pig house-dust and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while also assessing Î±-amylase activity. However, the relationship between LTB4 and amylase activity is not explicitly discussed, indicating that they are part of separate measurements without a direct interaction or functional link established in the study."
