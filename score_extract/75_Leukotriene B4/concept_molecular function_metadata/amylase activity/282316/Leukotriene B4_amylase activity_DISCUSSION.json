    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and amylase activity are both measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess potential salivary contamination. The study highlights that while LTB4 levels and amylase activity are quantified in saliva, the variability in amylase activity raises concerns about its reliability as a marker for excluding saliva contamination in EBC samples. Thus, the relationship is primarily focused on the methodological implications of measuring these substances together rather than a direct biological interaction."
