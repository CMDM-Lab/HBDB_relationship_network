    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and amylase activity are both measured in saliva samples collected from healthy volunteers. The study demonstrates a direct relationship, as increasing amounts of saliva added to exhaled breath condensate (EBC) resulted in parallel increments in both LTB4 levels and amylase activity. This suggests a potential correlation between the two, indicating that saliva contamination can influence the levels of both biomarkers in EBC samples."
