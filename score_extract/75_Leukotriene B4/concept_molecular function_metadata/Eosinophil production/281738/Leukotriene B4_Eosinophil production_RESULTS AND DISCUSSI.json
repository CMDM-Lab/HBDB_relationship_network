    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils, demonstrating a direct relationship between LTB4 and eosinophil migration. The study shows that eosinophils migrate robustly towards LTB4, indicating that LTB4 plays a critical role in eosinophil production and accumulation, particularly in response to stimuli such as C. elegans. The requirement of LTB4 signaling for eosinophil migration further underscores its significance in eosinophil biology."
