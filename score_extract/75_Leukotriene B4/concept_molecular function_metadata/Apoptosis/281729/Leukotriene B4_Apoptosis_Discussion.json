    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in the regulation of neutrophil survival and apoptosis. The text indicates that LTB4 can induce a positive feedback mechanism that supports neutrophil survival, potentially delaying apoptosis. This relationship is significant in understanding the accumulation of neutrophils in conditions like sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), where LTB4 facilitates both the recruitment of neutrophils and their prolonged survival, contributing to systemic inflammation."
