    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in various respiratory disorders, as evidenced by its elevated levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with conditions like asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. The presence of LTB4 in EBC suggests its potential role as a biomarker for inflammation in respiratory diseases, linking it directly to respiratory dysfunction."
