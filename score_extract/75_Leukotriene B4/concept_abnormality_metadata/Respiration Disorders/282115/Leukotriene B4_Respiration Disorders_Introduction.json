    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a significant mediator in the pathophysiology of various respiratory disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. It acts as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, contributing to inflammation in the airways. The measurement of LTB4 levels in biological fluids, particularly in patients with respiratory diseases, is crucial for understanding its role and potential therapeutic implications in managing these conditions."
