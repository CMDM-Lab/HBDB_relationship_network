    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in the inflammatory response associated with arthritis. It is produced by neutrophils and plays a crucial role in leukocyte accumulation during inflammatory diseases. The dual expression of ALOX5 and the LTB4 receptor LTB4R1 in neutrophils is essential for their recruitment in arthritis models, indicating a significant role for LTB4 in mediating inflammation and potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of arthritis."
