    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its increased concentrations found in the exhaled breath condensate of patients. The presence of LTB4 is associated with inflammatory responses in various pulmonary diseases, including COPD, suggesting its role in leukocyte attraction and inflammation in the airways. This relationship underscores the potential of LTB4 as a non-invasive diagnostic parameter for chronic obstructive airway disease."
