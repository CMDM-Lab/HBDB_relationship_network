    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant mediator in inflammatory responses within the lungs and airways, particularly in conditions like Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). Elevated levels of LTB4 have been observed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from COPD patients, indicating its role in neutrophilic inflammation associated with the disease. The study aims to further investigate LTB4 levels in a model of induced neutrophilic inflammation, highlighting its potential involvement in the pathophysiology of COPD."
