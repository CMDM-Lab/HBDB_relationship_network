    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is mentioned as a significant leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa, with elevated levels observed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with respiratory conditions like asthma and rhinitis. While there is a noted comorbidity between asthma and Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD), the direct relationship between LTB4 and COPD is not explicitly detailed. The context suggests a potential link through inflammation, but lacks specific evidence connecting LTB4 levels directly to COPD pathology."
