    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is measured in exhaled breath of atopic children with asthma to assess its levels in relation to inhaled fluticasone treatment. The study finds that lower doses of fluticasone correlate with higher LTB4 levels in asthmatic children, indicating a potential link between LTB4 and the atopic condition in the context of asthma management. However, no significant differences in LTB4 levels were observed between atopic non-asthmatic children and healthy controls, suggesting that while LTB4 is relevant in asthma, its role in atopy may not be as pronounced."
