    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of atopic asthmatic children, atopic non-asthmatic children, and healthy children. The studies aim to establish the presence and measurement of LTB4, which is relevant in understanding its role in atopic conditions, particularly asthma. The focus on atopic children indicates a direct relationship between LTB4 and atopic asthma, suggesting that LTB4 may be a significant biomarker in this population."
