    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a biomarker for airway inflammation in steroid-na√Øve children with atopic asthma. Elevated LTB4 levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) were observed in these children compared to healthy controls, indicating a significant relationship between LTB4 and atopic asthma. The study suggests that LTB4 measurement can help assess airway inflammation, particularly in atopic children with asthma who are not receiving glucocorticoid treatment."
