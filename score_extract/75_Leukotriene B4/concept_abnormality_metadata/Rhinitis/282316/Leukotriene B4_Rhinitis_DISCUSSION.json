    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a major leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa, with elevated levels observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis compared to controls. This suggests a significant role of LTB4 in the inflammatory processes associated with rhinitis, particularly in the context of its comorbidity with asthma. The data indicates that LTB4 levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may reflect underlying inflammatory events in the upper airways related to rhinitis."
