    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. The text discusses LTB4's role in signaling and its interaction with leukocyte receptors, suggesting that increased levels of LTB4 in secretions may contribute to the inflammatory processes observed in psoriasis. This indicates a potential link between LTB4 and the pathophysiology of psoriasis, although the specifics of this relationship are not deeply explored."
