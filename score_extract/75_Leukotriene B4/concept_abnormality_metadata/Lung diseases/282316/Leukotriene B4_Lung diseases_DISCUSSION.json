    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and its elevated levels in subjects with various lung diseases. The study indicates that while LTB4 is not detected in healthy controls, it is found in higher concentrations in individuals with lung diseases, suggesting a potential role of LTB4 as a biomarker for inflammation or disease severity in these conditions. This relationship highlights the significance of LTB4 in the context of lung pathology."
