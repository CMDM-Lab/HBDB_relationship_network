    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a significant mediator in the pathophysiology of various inflammatory airway diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. It acts as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, indicating its role in the inflammatory response associated with these lung diseases. The measurement of LTB4 concentrations in biological fluids is crucial for understanding its involvement in pulmonary diseases and evaluating therapeutic interventions."
