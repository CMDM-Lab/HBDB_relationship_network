    "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker for various lung diseases, including COPD, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. Elevated levels of LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) suggest its role in the pathophysiology of these conditions, indicating that it may serve as an early diagnostic indicator even before symptoms manifest. This establishes a clear and direct relationship between LTB4 and lung diseases."
