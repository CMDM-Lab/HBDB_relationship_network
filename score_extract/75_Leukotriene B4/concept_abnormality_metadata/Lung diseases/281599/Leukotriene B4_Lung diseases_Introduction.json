    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in various lung diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Increased levels of LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) suggest its role in the inflammatory response associated with these conditions. The study indicates that LTB4 could serve as a valuable non-invasive diagnostic parameter for pulmonary diseases, emphasizing its relevance in the context of lung inflammation and disease progression."
