    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of children with asthma. The study aims to measure LTB4 concentrations using advanced mass spectrometry techniques, indicating a potential role of LTB4 as a biomarker or mediator in asthma pathophysiology. The focus on LTB4 suggests its relevance in the inflammatory processes associated with asthma, although specific findings on its impact are not detailed in the provided text."
