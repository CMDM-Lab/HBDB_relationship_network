    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential biomarker for asthma. The study employs gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure LTB4 concentrations in both asthma patients and healthy controls. The focus on LTB4 in relation to asthma suggests its relevance in understanding airway inflammation and disease mechanisms, although the specificity of measurement methods is noted as a limitation."
