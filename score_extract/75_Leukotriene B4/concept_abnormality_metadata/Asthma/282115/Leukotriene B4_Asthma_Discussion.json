    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is discussed in relation to asthma, particularly in how its levels are affected by inhaled glucocorticoid treatment in asthmatic children. The study indicates that children receiving higher doses of fluticasone exhibited lower exhaled LTB4 values compared to those who were steroid-naive, suggesting a potential role of LTB4 in asthma inflammation and the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy in managing airway inflammation."
