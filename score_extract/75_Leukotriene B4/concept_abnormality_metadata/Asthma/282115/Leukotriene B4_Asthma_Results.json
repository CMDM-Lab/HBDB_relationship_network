    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is mentioned in relation to asthma, specifically in the analysis of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from different groups of children, including those with asthma. The study notes that LTB4 levels were measured but found no correlation with exhaled nitric oxide (NO) or other demographic factors. This suggests that while LTB4 is relevant to asthma, its specific role or significance in the condition remains unclear, particularly in steroid-na√Øve asthmatic children compared to those treated with steroids."
