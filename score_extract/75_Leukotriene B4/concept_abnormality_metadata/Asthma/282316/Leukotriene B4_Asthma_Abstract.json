    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant chemotactic mediator involved in inflammatory reactions within the lungs and airways, particularly in asthma. Elevated levels of LTB4 have been observed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from asthma patients compared to healthy individuals, indicating its role in neutrophilic inflammation associated with asthma. The study aims to measure LTB4 levels in a model of induced airway inflammation, further supporting its relevance in asthma pathology."
