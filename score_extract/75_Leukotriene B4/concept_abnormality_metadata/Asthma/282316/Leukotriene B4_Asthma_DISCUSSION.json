    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant leukotriene produced in the nasal mucosa, with implications for asthma due to its association with inflammatory responses. The text mentions a comorbidity between asthma and rhinitis, suggesting that elevated LTB4 levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) may reflect underlying inflammatory processes relevant to asthma. The study indicates that higher LTB4 levels are observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, which often coexists with asthma, linking LTB4 to asthma pathophysiology indirectly through its role in airway inflammation."
