    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant molecule in the inflammatory response associated with asthma. Increased levels of LTB4 have been found in the exhaled breath condensate of asthma patients, suggesting its role in attracting leukocytes and potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of asthma. The presence of LTB4 in diagnostic tests indicates its relevance in monitoring pulmonary diseases, including asthma."
