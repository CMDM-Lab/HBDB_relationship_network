    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is identified as a significant mediator in inflammatory disorders, particularly in the recruitment of eosinophils during nematode infections. The production of LTB4 by eosinophils and its role in leukocyte accumulation highlight its critical involvement in inflammatory responses associated with various inflammatory diseases. The study emphasizes the importance of LTB4 signaling in the pathophysiology of these disorders, suggesting a direct link between LTB4 and inflammatory processes."
