    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a biomarker for airway inflammation, particularly in patients with inflammatory airway diseases. The measurement of LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using advanced analytical techniques is proposed as a non-invasive method to assess and monitor inflammation associated with various inflammatory disorders. This suggests a direct relevance of LTB4 in the context of inflammatory conditions."
