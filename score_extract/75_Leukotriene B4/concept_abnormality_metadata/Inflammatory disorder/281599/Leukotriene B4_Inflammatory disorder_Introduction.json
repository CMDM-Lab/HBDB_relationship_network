    "summary": "Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is closely associated with various inflammatory disorders, as evidenced by its increased levels in the secretions of conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). LTB4 functions through its receptors, primarily BLT1 and BLT2, to attract leukocytes and may play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) suggests its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing inflammatory pulmonary diseases."
