    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is implicated in chronic bronchitis as part of the inflammatory response. Increased levels of LTB4 have been found in the secretions of patients with chronic bronchitis, suggesting its role in leukocyte attraction and inflammation. The presence of LTB4 in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) indicates its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing chronic bronchitis and other pulmonary diseases, highlighting its relevance in the pathophysiology of chronic bronchitis."
