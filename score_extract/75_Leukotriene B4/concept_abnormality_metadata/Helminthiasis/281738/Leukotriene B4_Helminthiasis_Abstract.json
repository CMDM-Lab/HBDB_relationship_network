    "summary": "In this context, leukotriene B4 is identified as a crucial signaling molecule that facilitates the migration of eosinophils towards nematodes, including the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. This paracrine signaling is essential for eosinophil accumulation around the nematodes, indicating a significant role of leukotriene B4 in the immune response to helminthiasis. The study highlights the specific interaction between eosinophils and helminths, mediated by leukotriene B4, suggesting its importance in the host's defense against parasitic infections."
