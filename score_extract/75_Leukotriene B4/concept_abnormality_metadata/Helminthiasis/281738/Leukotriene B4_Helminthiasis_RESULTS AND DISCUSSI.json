    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is shown to play a significant role in the migration and accumulation of eosinophils in response to helminth infection, specifically involving the nematode C. elegans. The study indicates that LTB4 production is stimulated by the presence of these worms, and its signaling is crucial for eosinophil recruitment, suggesting a direct relationship between LTB4 and the immune response to helminthiasis."
