    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant mediator in various inflammatory diseases, including Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The increased levels of LTB4 in secretions from patients with ARDS suggest its role in leukocyte attraction and inflammation. This positions LTB4 as a potential biomarker for diagnosing pulmonary diseases, including ARDS, due to its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC)."
