    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is analyzed as a potential non-invasive biomarker for airway inflammation in children with extrinsic asthma (atopic asthma). The study shows that LTB4 concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are significantly elevated in steroid-na√Øve children with asthma compared to healthy controls and other groups, indicating a direct relationship between LTB4 levels and the inflammatory processes associated with extrinsic asthma. This suggests that LTB4 could play a critical role in the pathophysiology of this condition."
