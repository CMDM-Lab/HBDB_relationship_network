    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a biomarker that is elevated in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with cystic fibrosis, among other respiratory diseases. The study indicates that LTB4 levels are significantly higher in cystic fibrosis, suggesting its potential role in the inflammatory processes associated with the disease. The presence of LTB4 in EBC may serve as a noninvasive indicator of disease activity in cystic fibrosis patients."
