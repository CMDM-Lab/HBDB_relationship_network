    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant chemotactic mediator involved in inflammatory responses in the lungs, with elevated levels observed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) from cystic fibrosis patients. This suggests a direct relationship where LTB4 may play a role in the inflammatory processes associated with cystic fibrosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease severity and inflammation in affected individuals."
