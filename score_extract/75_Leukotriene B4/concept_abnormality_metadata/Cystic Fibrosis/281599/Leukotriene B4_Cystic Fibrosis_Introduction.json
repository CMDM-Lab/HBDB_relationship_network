    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is highlighted as a significant biomarker in various inflammatory diseases, including cystic fibrosis. The increased levels of LTB4 found in secretions from cystic fibrosis patients suggest its role in the inflammatory response associated with the disease. The study indicates that LTB4 may not only attract leukocytes but also serve as a diagnostic parameter for pulmonary diseases, emphasizing its relevance in cystic fibrosis pathology."
