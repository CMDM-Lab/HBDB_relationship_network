    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is evaluated in relation to the Zr0.4Ce0.6−x Mn x O2 solid solutions, which serve as catalysts for the total oxidation of butanol. The study highlights the catalytic performance of these solid solutions, particularly at a specific composition (x = 0.36), achieving a high conversion rate of 90% for butan-1-ol at 175°C. The relationship is significant as the solid solution's properties directly influence the catalytic activity for butanol oxidation."
