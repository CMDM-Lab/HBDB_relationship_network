    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is mentioned in relation to its oxidation experiments using various catalytic systems, specifically focusing on the performance of mixed metal oxides like Zr–Ce–Mn–O. The study aims to optimize these oxides for the complete oxidation of butan-1-ol, indicating a direct relationship where the oxides serve as catalysts for the oxidation process of butan-1-ol. This suggests a significant interaction between the compound and the oxides in the context of catalytic oxidation reactions."
