    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) undergoing oxidation, while vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is part of a catalyst system (V2O5â€“WO3/TiO2) used for the oxidation of various compounds, including butanol. The study highlights the catalytic activity of vanadium pentoxide in facilitating the oxidation of butan-1-ol, indicating a direct relationship where V2O5 enhances the reaction efficiency for butanol oxidation compared to other VOCs."
