    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is oxidized to produce butanal, which is identified as the major intermediate product in the oxidation process. Other aldehydes, such as propanal and ethanal, are also mentioned but are produced in negligible amounts. This indicates a direct relationship between butan-1-ol and aldehydes, particularly butanal, as a significant product of its oxidation."
