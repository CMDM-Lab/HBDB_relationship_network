    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol and chlorobenzene are both mentioned in relation to their classification reliability in a study comparing equilibrium response and bitmap data sets. The results indicate that both compounds show significant improvements in identification reliability when using bitmap data, suggesting that their properties can be effectively distinguished through advanced analytical methods. However, the context does not delve into any specific chemical interactions or biological implications between butan-1-ol and chlorobenzene."
