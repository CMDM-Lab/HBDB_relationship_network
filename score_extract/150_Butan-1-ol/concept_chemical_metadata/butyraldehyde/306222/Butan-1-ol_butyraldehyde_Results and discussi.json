    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol and butyraldehyde are related through the catalytic oxidation process where butan-1-ol is oxidized to form butyraldehyde (butanal) as an intermediate. The reaction scheme indicates that butan-1-ol undergoes conversion to butanal, which is then further oxidized to CO2. This highlights a direct chemical transformation between the two compounds during the oxidation process."
