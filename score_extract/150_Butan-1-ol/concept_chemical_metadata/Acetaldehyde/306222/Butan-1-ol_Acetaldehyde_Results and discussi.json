    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is discussed in relation to its oxidation process, where butanal is identified as a major intermediate product. While acetaldehyde is mentioned as another aldehyde produced during oxidation, it is noted to be in negligible concentrations compared to butanal. Thus, the relationship between butan-1-ol and acetaldehyde is indirect, as both are products of oxidation but with butanal being the primary focus in the conversion process."
