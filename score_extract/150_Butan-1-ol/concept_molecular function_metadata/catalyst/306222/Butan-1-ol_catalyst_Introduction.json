    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) undergoing oxidation in the presence of various catalysts, specifically focusing on the effectiveness of group VIII metal catalysts like Pt and Pd, as well as mixed metal oxides like Zr–Ce–Mn–O. The study aims to optimize catalyst performance for the complete oxidation of butan-1-ol, indicating a direct relationship where the catalyst is essential for the oxidation process of butan-1-ol."
