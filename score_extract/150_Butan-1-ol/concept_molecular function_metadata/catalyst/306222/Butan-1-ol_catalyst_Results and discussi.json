    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is discussed in relation to its conversion efficiency over various catalysts, particularly in the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The text highlights the performance of different catalytic systems, including commercial catalysts, in achieving high conversion rates of butan-1-ol at specific temperatures. This indicates a direct relationship where the catalytic properties significantly influence the oxidation process of butan-1-ol."
