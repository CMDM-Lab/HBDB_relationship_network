    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is discussed primarily in relation to its environmental exposure and potential health effects, particularly through inhalation in occupational settings. While the text mentions symptoms such as central nervous system depression and ocular issues, it does not explicitly connect these effects to the inspiration function or respiratory health. Therefore, the relationship between butan-1-ol and inspiration function is implied but not directly addressed."
