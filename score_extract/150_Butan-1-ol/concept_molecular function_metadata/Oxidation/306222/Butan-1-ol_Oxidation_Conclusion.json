    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is discussed in relation to its total oxidation, which is catalyzed by Zr0.4Ce0.6âˆ’x Mn x O2 solid solutions. The study highlights the catalytic activity of these materials in facilitating the oxidation of butan-1-ol, indicating a direct relationship where the oxidation process is a key focus of the research. The presence of specific redox couples enhances the catalytic efficiency for the complete oxidation of butan-1-ol, demonstrating a significant interaction between the compound and the oxidation process."
