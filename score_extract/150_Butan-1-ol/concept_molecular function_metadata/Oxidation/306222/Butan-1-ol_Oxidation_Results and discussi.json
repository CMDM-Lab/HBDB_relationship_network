    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is directly involved in oxidation reactions, where it is converted to butanal and subsequently to CO2. The oxidation process is highlighted as a significant pathway for butan-1-ol, with specific temperature conditions affecting the conversion efficiency. The study emphasizes the catalytic oxidation of butan-1-ol, indicating a clear and direct relationship between butan-1-ol and oxidation processes."
