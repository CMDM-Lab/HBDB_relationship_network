    "summary": "In this context, butan-1-ol is mentioned in relation to its catalytic oxidation, which implies a connection to enzyme activity involved in the oxidation process. However, the specific enzyme activity is not detailed or quantified, and the focus is primarily on the catalytic properties of the synthesized solid solutions rather than a direct relationship with enzyme activity. Thus, while there is an implied connection, it lacks explicit discussion."
