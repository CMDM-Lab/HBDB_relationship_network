    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mentioned as a chlorinated hydrocarbon with potential cancer risks due to long-term exposure, particularly in indoor environments. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of Tangier Disease, which is a genetic disorder affecting lipid metabolism.
