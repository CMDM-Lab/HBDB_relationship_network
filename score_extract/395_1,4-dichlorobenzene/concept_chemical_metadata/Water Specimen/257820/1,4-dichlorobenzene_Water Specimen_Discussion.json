    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is identified as a significant treatment performance indicator for assessing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in recycled water, specifically in the context of reverse osmosis (RO) treatment. It was detected in a high percentage of samples, indicating its prevalence in recycled water and its relevance in evaluating treatment efficiency. The study highlights the challenges of detecting all VOCs in recycled water, with 1,4-dichlorobenzene serving as a key marker for treatment performance."
