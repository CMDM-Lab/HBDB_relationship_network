    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios in classrooms and kindergartens. However, the text primarily focuses on the I/O values of various VOCs without detailing any specific interactions or comparative significance between 1,4-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene. Their mention is more about their presence in the same study rather than a direct relationship."
