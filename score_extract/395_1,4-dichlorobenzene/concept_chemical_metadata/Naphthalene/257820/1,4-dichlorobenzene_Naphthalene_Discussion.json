    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and naphthalene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in post-microfiltration (MF) water samples during a study on wastewater treatment processes. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions, chemical properties, or comparative significance in the treatment process, indicating a general association as part of a broader analysis of VOCs in treated water."
