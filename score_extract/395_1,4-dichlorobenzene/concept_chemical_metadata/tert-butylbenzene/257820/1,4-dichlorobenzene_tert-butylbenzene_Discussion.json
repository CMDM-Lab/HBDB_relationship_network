    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and tert-butylbenzene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in post-microfiltration (MF) water samples during a study on wastewater treatment processes. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or comparative significance in the treatment process, indicating they are simply part of a broader analysis of VOCs present in the samples."
