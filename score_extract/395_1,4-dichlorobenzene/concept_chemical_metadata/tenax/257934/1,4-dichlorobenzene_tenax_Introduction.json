    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is evaluated as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) trapped and desorbed using Tenax TA, a widely used sorbent in gas sampling. The study compares the performance of Tenax TA with newer polymeric resins in terms of their ability to capture and release various VOCs, including 1,4-dichlorobenzene. This indicates a direct functional relationship where Tenax serves as a medium for analyzing the behavior of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in chromatographic processes."
