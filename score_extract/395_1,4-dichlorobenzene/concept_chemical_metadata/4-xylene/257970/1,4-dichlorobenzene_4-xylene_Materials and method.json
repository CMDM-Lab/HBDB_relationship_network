    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 4-xylene are both listed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored in the Scheldt estuary over a three-year period. They are part of a broader study on the occurrence and variability of priority hazardous substances in the environment. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or relationships beyond their classification as VOCs and inclusion in the same monitoring survey."
