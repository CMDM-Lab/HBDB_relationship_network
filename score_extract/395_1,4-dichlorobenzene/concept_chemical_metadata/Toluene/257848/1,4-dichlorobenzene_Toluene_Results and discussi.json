    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with reported indoor air quality measurements. However, their specific relationship is not discussed in detail. The focus is on the indoor sources and mean indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of various VOCs, including toluene, which has a significant I/O value, while 1,4-dichlorobenzene is not highlighted in the same manner. Thus, they are related as components of indoor air quality assessments but lack a direct interaction or functional relationship."
