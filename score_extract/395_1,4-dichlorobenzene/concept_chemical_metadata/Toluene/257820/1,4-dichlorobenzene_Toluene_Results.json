    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in groundwater samples. However, their relationship is limited to their co-occurrence in the same environmental study, with no further discussion on their interactions, effects, or significance in relation to each other. The detection percentages for both compounds are low, indicating minimal relevance in terms of their environmental impact or chemical interactions."
