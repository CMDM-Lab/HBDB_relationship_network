    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 2-chlorotoluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tested for their toxicity in a static luminescent bacteria test. They are part of a mixture toxicity experiment aimed at evaluating the effects of various VOCs on bacterial luminescence, indicating their relevance in assessing environmental toxicity. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative toxicity within the study."
