    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in post-membrane filtration (MF) water samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations in treated wastewater, indicating their presence but lacking specific relevance to each other."
