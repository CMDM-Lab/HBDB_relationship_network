    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is identified as a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons. The study highlights a correlation between exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene and certain biochemical liver tests, suggesting that this compound, along with other aromatic hydrocarbons, may impact liver function. The relationship is established through statistical analysis, indicating that both 1,4-dichlorobenzene and aromatic hydrocarbons collectively influence liver biochemical markers."
