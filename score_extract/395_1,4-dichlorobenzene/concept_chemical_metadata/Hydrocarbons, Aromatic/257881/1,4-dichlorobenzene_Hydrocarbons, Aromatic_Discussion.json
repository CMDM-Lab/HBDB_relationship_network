    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is identified as a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) that falls under the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons. The study discusses the relationship between personal exposure to various aromatic hydrocarbons, including 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and their effects on biochemical liver tests. While 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mentioned alongside other aromatic hydrocarbons, the focus is on its association with serum concentrations of LDH and total bilirubin, indicating a potential health impact related to its exposure as part of the aromatic hydrocarbon group."
