    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and butadiene are both listed as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) among a group of volatile organic compounds. They are mentioned together in the context of their prevalence in various microenvironments, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions, effects, or any direct relationship beyond their classification as pollutants. Thus, their connection is limited to being part of a broader list of harmful substances without further elaboration on their individual or comparative significance."
