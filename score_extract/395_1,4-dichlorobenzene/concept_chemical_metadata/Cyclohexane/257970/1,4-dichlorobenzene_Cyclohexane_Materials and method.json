    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and cyclohexane are both listed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored in the Scheldt estuary over a three-year period. However, the text does not provide any specific information about their interactions, chemical properties, or any comparative analysis between the two compounds. They are simply part of a broader study on VOC levels without a direct relationship established."
