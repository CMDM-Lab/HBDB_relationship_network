    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene and acetaldehyde are both identified as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) contributing to personal exposure levels in urban environments. They are mentioned together in the context of indoor air quality, where their concentrations are significantly higher than outdoor levels. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly detailed, indicating they are part of a broader discussion on HAPs rather than having a direct interaction or comparison."
