    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is mentioned as a chemical contributing to cancer risk estimates based on inhalation rates, particularly in males who may have higher exposure due to occupational settings. The relationship to 'inspiration function' is indirect, as inhalation rates are a factor in assessing exposure risk, but there is no direct discussion of how 1,4-dichlorobenzene specifically affects respiratory function or inspiration mechanics."
