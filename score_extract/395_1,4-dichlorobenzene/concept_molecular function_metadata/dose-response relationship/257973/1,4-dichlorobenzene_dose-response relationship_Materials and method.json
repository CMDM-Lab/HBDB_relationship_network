    "summary": "In this context, 1,4-dichlorobenzene is part of a study assessing the dose-response relationships of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on luminescent bacteria. The experiments aim to determine how different concentrations of 1,4-dichlorobenzene affect bacterial toxicity, indicating a direct relationship between the compound's concentration and its toxic effects on the bacteria. This relationship is crucial for understanding the environmental impact of 1,4-dichlorobenzene in groundwater remediation efforts."
