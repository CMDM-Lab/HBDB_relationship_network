    "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as a methylated alkane found in exhaled breath, particularly in patients with non-small lung cancer (NSLC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and smokers. The study highlights that the concentration of decane in exhaled breath is significantly higher in these pathological states compared to controls, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for lung diseases. This indicates a direct relationship between decane and exhalation, as the presence of decane in breath samples is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation processes in the lungs."
