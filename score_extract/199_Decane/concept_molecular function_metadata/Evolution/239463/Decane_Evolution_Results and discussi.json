    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the alkanes whose area reduction correlates with the improvement in asthma symptoms in a child undergoing treatment. The evolution of the child's condition is tracked through changes in the levels of these compounds, suggesting that the decrease in decane levels may reflect a reduction in inflammation and oxidative stress associated with asthma. This indicates a potential relationship between the metabolic changes of decane and the evolution of the child's health status over the treatment period."
