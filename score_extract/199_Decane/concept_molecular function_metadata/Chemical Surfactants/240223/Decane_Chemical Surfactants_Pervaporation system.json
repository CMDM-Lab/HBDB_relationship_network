    "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the marker compounds in the removal process of Varsolâ„¢ using chemical surfactants. The study discusses the partitioning behavior of decane in relation to surfactant concentrations, indicating that its removal is expected to be less efficient compared to other compounds like 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. The relationship highlights the role of chemical surfactants in the removal of decane from a surfactant solution, suggesting a significant interaction in the context of environmental remediation."
