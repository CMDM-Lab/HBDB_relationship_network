    "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the alkanes that characterize the breath profile of asthmatic children. The study highlights the role of decane, along with other compounds, in distinguishing between allergic asthmatic and control populations. This suggests that decane may be relevant in understanding metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, although it is mentioned alongside other compounds without detailed interaction."
