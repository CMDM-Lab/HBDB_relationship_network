    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the compounds selected for a new PLS-DA model aimed at distinguishing between allergic asthmatic children and control subjects based on their exhaled breath profiles. The inclusion of decane, along with other alkanes and aldehydes, suggests its relevance in metabolic pathways associated with asthma, although no specific interactions or unique properties of decane are detailed beyond its role in the breath analysis model."
