    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a specific aliphatic compound tested for its effects on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. The study indicates that decane, along with other aliphatic compounds, did not cause any cytotoxic effects or significant changes in cytokine/chemokine production when compared to control cultures. This suggests that decane does not have a notable biological impact in the tested conditions."
