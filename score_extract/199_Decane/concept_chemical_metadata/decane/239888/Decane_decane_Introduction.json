    "summary": "In this context, 'Decane' and 'decane' refer to the same aliphatic compound, specifically n-decane, which is included in a study investigating the pro-inflammatory potential of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study aims to analyze the inflammatory effects of n-decane along with other aliphatic and aromatic compounds over a wide concentration range. However, there is no additional discussion or differentiation between the two terms, as they are simply different representations of the same chemical."
