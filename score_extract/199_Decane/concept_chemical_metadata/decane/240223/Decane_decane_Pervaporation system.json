    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned in relation to its removal efficiency during a surfactant plateau region, where it averaged 56% removal. The discussion focuses on the performance of decane in comparison to undecane and other compounds, indicating its significance in the study of surfactant interactions and removal processes. However, there is no additional detail on the specific chemical properties or interactions of decane itself."
