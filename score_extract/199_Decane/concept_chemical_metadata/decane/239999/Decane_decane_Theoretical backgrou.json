    "summary": "In this context, the term 'decane' is mentioned as 'n-decane,' referring to a specific alkane with ten carbon atoms. The discussion focuses on the behavior of n-decane in gaseous displacement experiments and its interactions with soil, particularly regarding its adsorption and partitioning. However, there is no distinct relationship or interaction described between different forms of decane, as the term is used consistently to refer to the same compound."
