    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a gaseous interfacial tracer used to study the relationship between air saturation and water saturation in unsaturated soils. The study highlights the linear relationship between the calculated air interfacial value and water saturation, indicating decane's role in enhancing air-water contact area during surfactant-enhanced air sparging experiments. However, the mention of decane does not provide additional insights into its specific properties or interactions beyond its use as a tracer."
