    "summary": "In this context, decane and propane are both mentioned as non-methane hydrocarbons analyzed in the Boulder air standard. However, the discussion focuses on the recovery rates of various compounds, indicating that while propane experienced significant losses during sampling, decane did not. This suggests a difference in behavior under the same conditions, but no direct interaction or functional relationship between the two compounds is established."
