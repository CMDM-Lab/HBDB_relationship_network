    "summary": "In this context, decane and nonanal are identified as part of a selected set of compounds used to distinguish between allergic asthmatic children and control subjects through breath analysis. Both compounds are categorized as alkanes and aldehydes, contributing to a pattern that aids in the non-invasive diagnosis of asthma. Their inclusion in the PLS-DA model indicates a potential relationship in metabolic pathways relevant to asthma pathology, although the specific interactions between decane and nonanal are not detailed."
