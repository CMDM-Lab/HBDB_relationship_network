    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a specific chemical involved in the study of gaseous displacement experiments and its interactions with soil. The text discusses the behavior of decane in relation to its low water solubility and its partitioning into different phases, indicating its relevance as a chemical in environmental studies. However, the relationship is primarily focused on decane's properties rather than a broader discussion of chemicals in general."
