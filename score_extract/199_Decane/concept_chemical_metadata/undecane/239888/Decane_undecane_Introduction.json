    "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are both mentioned as aliphatic compounds being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are part of a broader analysis of various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but no specific interactions or comparative effects between decane and undecane are detailed. Their relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same experimental model for assessing inflammatory effects."
