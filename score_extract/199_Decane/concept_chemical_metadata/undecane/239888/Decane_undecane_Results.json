    "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are mentioned as part of a study investigating the effects of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. However, neither decane nor undecane, along with other aliphatic compounds, showed any significant effects on cytokine/chemokine production, indicating that their relationship is limited to being part of a broader analysis of VOCs without any specific interaction or impact highlighted between them."
