    "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are identified as marker compounds of Varsol™, a hydrocarbon-based dry cleaning solvent. Both compounds are part of the measurement objectives for assessing the removal efficiency of Varsol™ during a pervaporation treatment project. Their presence indicates a shared role in evaluating the solvent's environmental impact, but no direct interaction or functional relationship between them is discussed."
