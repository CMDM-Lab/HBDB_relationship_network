    "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are both hydrocarbon compounds whose removal efficiencies were evaluated in the presence of surfactants. The study reports that undecane had an average removal rate of 33%, while decane had a higher removal rate of 56%. This indicates a comparative analysis of their effectiveness in a specific environmental remediation scenario, highlighting their functional relationship as secondary contaminants."
