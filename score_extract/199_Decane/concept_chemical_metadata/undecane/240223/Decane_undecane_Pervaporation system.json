    "summary": "In this context, decane and undecane are both mentioned as compounds whose removal efficiencies were evaluated during a surfactant plateau region. Decane removal averaged 56%, while undecane removal averaged 33%. This indicates a comparative analysis of their removal rates, suggesting that both compounds are relevant in the study of surfactant interactions and removal processes, although their specific interactions are not detailed."
