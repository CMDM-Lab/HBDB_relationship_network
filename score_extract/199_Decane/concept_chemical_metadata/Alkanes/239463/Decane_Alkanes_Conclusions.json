    "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the specific compounds belonging to the broader category of alkanes. The study highlights the use of various alkanes, including decane, in distinguishing between allergic asthmatic and control populations through breath analysis. This indicates that decane, as an alkane, plays a role in the metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, contributing to the identification of specific breath patterns linked to the condition."
