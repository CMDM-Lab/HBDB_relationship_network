    "summary": "In this context, decane and chlorobenzene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential. They are part of a broader study examining various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or comparative effects on inflammation. Their relationship is limited to their inclusion in the same experimental framework without detailed analysis of their individual or combined effects."
