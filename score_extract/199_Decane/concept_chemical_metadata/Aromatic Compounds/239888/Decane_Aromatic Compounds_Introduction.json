    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as one of the aliphatic compounds being investigated alongside various aromatic compounds, including styrene and m-xylene, for their pro-inflammatory potential. The study aims to analyze the inflammatory effects of both aliphatic and aromatic VOCs over a wide concentration range, indicating a comparative approach to understanding their biological impacts. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between decane and the aromatic compounds beyond their inclusion in the same experimental framework."
