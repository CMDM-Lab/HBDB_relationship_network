    "summary": "In this context, decane and methane are both mentioned as gaseous tracers in a study examining the transport of organic compounds through a sand column. The study highlights that n-decane is transported at a slower linear velocity compared to methane due to interfacial sorption at the air-water interface. This suggests a significant difference in their behavior in the environment, particularly in relation to mass transfer and sorption dynamics in contaminated aquifers."
