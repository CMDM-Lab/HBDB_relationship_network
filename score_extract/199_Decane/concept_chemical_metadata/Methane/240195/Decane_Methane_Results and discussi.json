    "summary": "In this context, decane and methane are both mentioned as components of a study analyzing the recovery of various hydrocarbons in air samples. However, the focus is primarily on the recovery rates of lighter hydrocarbons, with no specific discussion of the relationship or interaction between decane and methane. They are simply categorized as non-methane hydrocarbons, indicating they are part of a broader analysis without direct relevance to each other."
