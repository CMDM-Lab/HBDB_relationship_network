    "summary": "In this context, decane and heptanes are both mentioned as components of indoor air quality assessments, specifically regarding their concentrations in indoor versus outdoor environments. The indoor to outdoor concentration ratios for heptane and n-decane are noted to be significantly high, indicating that these compounds may be more prevalent indoors. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific chemical interactions or biological implications between decane and heptanes, focusing instead on their environmental concentrations."
