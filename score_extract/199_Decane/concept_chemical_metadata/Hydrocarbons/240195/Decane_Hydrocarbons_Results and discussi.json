    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a non-methane hydrocarbon that was analyzed in the Boulder air standard study. The results indicate that decane, along with other hydrocarbons from pentane to decane, did not suffer significant losses during the sampling process, suggesting its stability in the analyzed conditions. This positions decane within the broader category of hydrocarbons, highlighting its role in air quality studies, but does not elaborate on specific interactions or unique properties of decane compared to other hydrocarbons."
