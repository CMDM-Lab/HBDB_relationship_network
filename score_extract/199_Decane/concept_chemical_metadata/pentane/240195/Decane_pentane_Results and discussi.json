    "summary": "In this context, decane and pentane are both mentioned as non-methane hydrocarbons that were analyzed for recovery rates in air sampling experiments. The data indicates that while lighter compounds experienced significant losses, pentane through decane did not show such losses, suggesting that both compounds are stable under the sampling conditions described. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their recovery rates."
