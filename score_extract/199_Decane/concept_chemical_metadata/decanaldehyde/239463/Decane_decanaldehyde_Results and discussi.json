    "summary": "In this context, decane and decanaldehyde are part of a selected set of compounds used to distinguish between allergic asthmatic children and control subjects through breath analysis. Both compounds belong to the same chemical family, with decanaldehyde being an aldehyde derived from the oxidation of decane. Their inclusion in the breath-print analysis suggests a potential relationship in metabolic pathways relevant to asthma diagnosis, although the specific interaction between them is not elaborated upon."
