    "summary": "In this context, decane and n-dodecane are identified as part of a group of alkanes that characterize the breath profile of asthmatic children. Both compounds are included in the analysis of breath samples to distinguish between allergic asthmatic and control populations. Their presence in the breath-print suggests a potential link to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, although the specific interactions between decane and n-dodecane are not elaborated upon."
