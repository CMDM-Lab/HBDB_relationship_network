    "summary": "In this context, decane and n-dodecane are both mentioned as aliphatic compounds being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are part of a broader analysis of various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but no specific interactions or comparative effects between decane and n-dodecane are detailed. Their inclusion in the same study suggests a shared relevance in the context of VOCs, but their relationship is not explicitly defined."
