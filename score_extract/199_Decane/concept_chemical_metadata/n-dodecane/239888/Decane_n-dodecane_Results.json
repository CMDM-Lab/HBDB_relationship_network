    "summary": "In this context, decane and n-dodecane are both mentioned as aliphatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tested for their effects on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. However, neither decane nor n-dodecane, nor any of the other aliphatic compounds tested, showed any significant effects on cytokine/chemokine production, indicating that they do not have a notable biological interaction or impact in this experimental setup."
