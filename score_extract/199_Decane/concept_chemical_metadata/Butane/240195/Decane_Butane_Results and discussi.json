    "summary": "In this context, decane and butane are both mentioned as non-methane hydrocarbons analyzed in the Boulder air standard. However, the discussion focuses on the recovery rates of various compounds during the experiments, with no specific interaction or relationship between decane and butane highlighted. They are simply part of a broader analysis of hydrocarbon recovery without direct relevance to each other."
