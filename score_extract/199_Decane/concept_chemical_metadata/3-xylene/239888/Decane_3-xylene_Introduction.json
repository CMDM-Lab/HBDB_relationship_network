    "summary": "In this context, decane and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study examining various aliphatic and aromatic compounds. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or comparative effects on inflammation, indicating they are part of a broader analysis rather than having a defined relationship."
