    "summary": "In this context, decane and methylcyclopentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their pro-inflammatory potential in a study. They are part of a broader analysis of various aliphatic and aromatic compounds, but the specific relationship or interaction between decane and methylcyclopentane is not detailed. Their inclusion in the same study suggests they may share similar properties or effects, but no direct connection is established."
