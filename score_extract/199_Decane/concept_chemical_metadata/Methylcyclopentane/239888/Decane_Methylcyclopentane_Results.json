    "summary": "In this context, decane and methylcyclopentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tested for their effects on cytokine and chemokine release in A549 cells. However, neither compound exhibited any cytotoxic effects or significant influence on cytokine/chemokine production when compared to control cultures. Their relationship is limited to their inclusion in the same study without any direct interaction or comparative analysis between them."
