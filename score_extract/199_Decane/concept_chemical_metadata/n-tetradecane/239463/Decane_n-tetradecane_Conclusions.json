    "summary": "In this context, decane and n-tetradecane are both identified as alkanes that contribute to the 'breath-print' of asthmatic children. They are part of a larger group of compounds analyzed to distinguish between allergic asthmatic and control populations. Their presence in the breath samples suggests a potential link to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma, although the specific relationship between decane and n-tetradecane is not elaborated upon."
