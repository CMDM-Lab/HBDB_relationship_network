    "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the alkanes associated with the allergic asthma group, suggesting a potential link between exposure to decane and the manifestation of extrinsic asthma. The study indicates that the allergic asthma group is characterized by a higher prevalence of certain alkanes, including decane, compared to the control group, which is characterized by aldehydes. This suggests that decane may play a role in the pathophysiology of extrinsic asthma, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear."
