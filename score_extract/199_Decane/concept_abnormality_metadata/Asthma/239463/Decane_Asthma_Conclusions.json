    "summary": "In this context, decane is identified as one of the alkanes that characterize the breath profile of allergic asthmatic children. The study highlights the potential of using breath analysis to distinguish between asthmatic and control populations, suggesting that decane, along with other compounds, may be linked to metabolic pathways associated with allergic asthma. This indicates a significant relationship between decane and asthma, as it contributes to the identification of asthmatic conditions through breath analysis."
