    "summary": "In this context, decane is mentioned as a methylated alkane identified in exhaled breath studies of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study indicates that decane concentrations are higher in COPD patients compared to controls, suggesting a potential role of decane as a biomarker for oxidative stress and inflammation associated with chronic airway diseases. This relationship highlights the significance of alkanes in characterizing lung pathologies, including COPD."
