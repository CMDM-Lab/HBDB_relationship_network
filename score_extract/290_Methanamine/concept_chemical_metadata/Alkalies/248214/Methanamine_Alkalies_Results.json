    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its effect on the pH of the growth medium, which is relevant to the concept of alkalies. The treatment with methylamine raises the pH of the medium, indicating a shift towards more alkaline conditions. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, as the study primarily focuses on the growth of Bcc strains at various pH levels rather than a direct interaction between methanamine and alkalies. The inhibition of bacterial growth by methylamine appears to be independent of the pH changes induced."
