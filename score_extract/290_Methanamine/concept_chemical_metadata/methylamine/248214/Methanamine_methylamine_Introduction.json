    "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine are related as methylamine is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) produced by the bacterium P. haloplanktis TAC125 when grown in a medium enriched with L-methionine. While methanamine is not explicitly mentioned as a product, it is structurally related to methylamine, suggesting a potential connection in the metabolic pathways involved in VOC production. However, the focus is primarily on methylamine's antimicrobial activity against Bcc strains, with methanamine's role remaining unclear."
