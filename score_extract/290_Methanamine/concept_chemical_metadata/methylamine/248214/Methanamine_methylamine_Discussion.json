    "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine are related as both are amines, but the focus is primarily on methylamine's antimicrobial properties against Bcc strains. While methanamine is not explicitly discussed, its structural similarity to methylamine suggests potential relevance. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds, limiting the strength of their relationship."
