    "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine are related as both are amines that can influence the growth of Bcc strains. The study discusses the sensitivity of Bcc strains to methylamine, indicating that while some strains can grow at alkaline pH levels, they are inhibited by methylamine regardless of pH. This suggests a potential interaction between these two compounds in terms of microbial growth inhibition, although methanamine is not explicitly mentioned as being tested in the same capacity."
