    "summary": "In this context, methanamine and methylamine hydrochloride are directly related through a chemical reaction process. Methylamine hydrochloride serves as a precursor to generate gaseous methylamine via an acid-base reaction with sodium hydroxide. The amount of methylamine produced is quantitatively linked to the amount of methylamine hydrochloride used, indicating a clear functional relationship between the two compounds in the experimental setup."
