    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is linked to the process of alkalinization of the growth medium. The study indicates that exposure to methanamine leads to an increase in the pH of the TYP liquid medium, suggesting that methanamine can induce alkalinization. This change in pH may influence the growth inhibition of certain bacteria, highlighting a significant relationship between methanamine exposure and the alkalinization effect on the medium."
