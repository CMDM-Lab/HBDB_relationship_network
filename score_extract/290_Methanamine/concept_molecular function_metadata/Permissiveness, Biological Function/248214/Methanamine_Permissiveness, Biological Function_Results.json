    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its inhibitory effects on the growth of Bcc strains, suggesting a potential biological function related to growth permissiveness. The study indicates that while some strains can grow at alkaline pH levels, their growth is inhibited by methanamine, implying that the compound may affect the permissiveness of the growth environment for these bacteria. However, the exact biological function of methanamine in this context remains unclear, as it does not directly correlate with pH tolerance."
