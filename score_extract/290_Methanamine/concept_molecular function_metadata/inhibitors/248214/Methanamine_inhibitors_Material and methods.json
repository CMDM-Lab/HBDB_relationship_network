    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its role as a volatile compound, specifically methylamine, which is synthesized and tested for its inhibitory effects on bacterial strains. The term 'inhibitors' refers to the Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) of methylamine, indicating its potential to inhibit bacterial growth. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the measurement of inhibition rather than a detailed exploration of how methanamine functions as an inhibitor."
