    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is evaluated for its role as an inhibitor of bacterial growth, specifically against B. cenocepacia strains. The study investigates the Minimum Volatile Inhibitory Concentration (MVIC) of methanamine, demonstrating its effectiveness in inhibiting bacterial growth at certain concentrations. This indicates a direct relationship where methanamine acts as an inhibitor, affecting the growth of specific bacterial strains."
