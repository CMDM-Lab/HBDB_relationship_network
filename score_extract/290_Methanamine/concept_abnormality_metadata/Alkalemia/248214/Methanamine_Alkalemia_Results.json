    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is mentioned in relation to its effects on the growth of Bcc strains in alkaline pH conditions. While the study evaluates the growth of these strains at various pH levels, including alkaline conditions, there is no direct discussion of alkalemia, which refers to an excess of base in the body fluids. The relationship between methanamine and alkalemia is not explicitly established, as the focus is on microbial growth rather than physiological pH imbalances."
