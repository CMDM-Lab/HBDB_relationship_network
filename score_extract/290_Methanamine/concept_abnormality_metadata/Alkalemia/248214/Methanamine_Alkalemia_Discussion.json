    "summary": "In this context, methanamine is discussed in relation to its potential antimicrobial activity and metabolic pathways in the bacterium P. haloplanktis TAC125. However, there is no direct mention or exploration of alkalemia, which refers to a condition of increased blood pH. The relationship between methanamine and alkalemia is not established, as the focus is primarily on the metabolic processes and antimicrobial properties of methanamine without linking it to pH changes or alkalemia."
