    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is indirectly related to dehydration through its connection to furfural, which is a product of pentose dehydration. The strain R. eutropha exhibits high metabolic activity on furfural, indicating that dehydration processes in biomass pretreatment can lead to the formation of compounds like Furan-2-carbaldehyde. However, the specific relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and dehydration is not explicitly detailed, making the connection more general."
