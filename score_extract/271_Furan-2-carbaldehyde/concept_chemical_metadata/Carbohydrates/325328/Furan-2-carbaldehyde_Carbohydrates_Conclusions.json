    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is indirectly related to carbohydrates through its association with the degradation of carbohydrates, as indicated by the mention of furfural, which is linked to carbohydrate breakdown. While Furan-2-carbaldehyde itself is not explicitly discussed, its connection to carbohydrate degradation suggests a potential relevance in the context of food processing and the formation of byproducts from carbohydrates."
