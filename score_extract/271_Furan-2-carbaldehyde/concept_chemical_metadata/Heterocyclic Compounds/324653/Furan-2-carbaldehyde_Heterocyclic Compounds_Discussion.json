    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as an O-heterocyclic compound involved in the biological oxidation processes carried out by R. eutropha. The text discusses the enzymatic degradation of such compounds, indicating that Furan-2-carbaldehyde is part of a broader category of heterocyclic compounds that can be metabolized by specific microbial strains. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the enzymatic activity rather than a direct interaction between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and heterocyclic compounds as a whole."
