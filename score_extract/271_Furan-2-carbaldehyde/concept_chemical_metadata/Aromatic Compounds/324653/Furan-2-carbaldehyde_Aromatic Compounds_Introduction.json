    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as one of the important groups of hydrolysates generated during the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of biomass, alongside aromatic compounds. Both are categorized as byproducts of biomass pretreatment that can inhibit microbial activity, particularly in ethanol production. However, the specific relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and aromatic compounds is not elaborated upon beyond their shared classification as hydrolysates with inhibitory effects."
