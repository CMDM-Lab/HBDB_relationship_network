    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is indirectly related to bagasse as a product of the dilute acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process of bagasse. The hydrolysis of bagasse generates various hydrolysates, including furfural, which is a precursor to Furan-2-carbaldehyde. This indicates that Furan-2-carbaldehyde can be derived from the breakdown of bagasse, linking the two in the biorefinery process."
