    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde (furfural) is discussed as a derivative of pentoses, particularly xylose, which is not a good substrate for R. eutropha. However, furfural is identified as a suitable substrate for this organism, indicating a metabolic pathway where pentoses can be converted into more usable forms like furfural. This suggests a relationship where pentoses serve as precursors for the production of Furan-2-carbaldehyde, which can then be utilized by R. eutropha for growth."
