    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is indirectly related to pentoses through the discussion of hydrolysate inhibitors generated during the thermal pretreatment of biomass. The text mentions that pentoses can lead to the formation of inhibitors like furfural, which is a related compound. However, the specific relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and pentoses is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct interaction."
