    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as one of the hydrolysates generated during the dilute acid pretreatment of biomass, alongside organic acids. Both Furan-2-carbaldehyde and organic acids are products of biomass hydrolysis, which can inhibit microbial activity, particularly in ethanol production. However, the specific relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and organic acids is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
