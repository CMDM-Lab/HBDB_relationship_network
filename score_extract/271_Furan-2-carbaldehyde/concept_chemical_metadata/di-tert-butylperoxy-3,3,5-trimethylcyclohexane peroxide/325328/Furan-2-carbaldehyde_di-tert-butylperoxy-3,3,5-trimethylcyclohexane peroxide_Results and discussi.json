    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde and di-tert-butylperoxy-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane peroxide are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) quantified in various samples, including LDPE and WPC pellets. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions, functional relationships, or comparative significance within the study, indicating they are simply part of a broader analysis of VOCs without specific relevance to each other."
