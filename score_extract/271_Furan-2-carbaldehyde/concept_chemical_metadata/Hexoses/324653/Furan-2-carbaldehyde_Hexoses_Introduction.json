    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as a type of furaldehyde derived from hexose degradation during sugar processing. Hexoses, as sugars, are precursors in the formation of furaldehydes like Furan-2-carbaldehyde, which can inhibit microbial activity during ethanol production. The relationship highlights the impact of hexose degradation products on fermentation processes."
