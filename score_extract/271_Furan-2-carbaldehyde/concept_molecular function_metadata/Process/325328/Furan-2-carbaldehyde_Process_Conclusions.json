    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) characterized in wood-plastic composite (WPC) materials. The injection molding process significantly reduced the concentration of Furan-2-carbaldehyde in the samples, indicating a direct relationship between the processing method and the levels of this compound. The process also influenced the formation and degradation of other compounds, highlighting its role in VOC management during WPC production."
