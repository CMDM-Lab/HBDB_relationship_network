    "summary": "In this context, Furan-2-carbaldehyde is mentioned as an O-heterocyclic compound that undergoes oxidation to form carboxylic acid, facilitated by aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes. This process highlights the role of oxidation in the biodegradation of organic inhibitors, suggesting a direct relationship between Furan-2-carbaldehyde and oxidation in microbial activity and catabolic pathways."
