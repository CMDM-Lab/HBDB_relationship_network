    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is linked to the catabolic state through its production in response to arginine deficiency during sepsis. The study suggests that insufficient NO production may exacerbate the catabolic state, while excessive NO can lead to hemodynamic instability. This indicates a complex relationship where NO levels influence metabolic and physiological responses in critically ill patients."
