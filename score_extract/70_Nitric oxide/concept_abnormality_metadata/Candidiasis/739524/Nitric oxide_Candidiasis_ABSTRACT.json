    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the immune response against Candidiasis, specifically in the production by peritoneal macrophages (MÏ†). The study indicates that impairment in NO production correlates with reduced antibody responses to Candida albicans in GKO mice, highlighting NO's role in host defense mechanisms against this opportunistic pathogen. The findings suggest that adequate NO levels are crucial for effective immune responses to C. albicans infections."
