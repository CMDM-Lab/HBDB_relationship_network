    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted for its dual role in airway diseases, acting as both a marker of airway inflammation and a regulatory molecule in the lower airways. Increased levels of NO and its metabolites are associated with inflammatory conditions such as asthma and bronchiectasis, indicating its significant involvement in the pathogenesis of airway diseases. This suggests that NO is crucial for understanding and potentially managing airway inflammation and related disorders."
