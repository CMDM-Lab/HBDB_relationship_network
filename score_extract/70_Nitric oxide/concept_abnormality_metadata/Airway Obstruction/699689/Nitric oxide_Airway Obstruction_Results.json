    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is mentioned in relation to airway obstruction in subjects with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Although exhaled nitric oxide levels were measured, they did not significantly differ between healthy controls and BPD subjects, suggesting that NO may not be a reliable biomarker for assessing airway obstruction severity in this population. The spirometric measurements indicate varying degrees of airway obstruction, but the lack of difference in NO levels implies a complex relationship that may not directly correlate with the degree of obstruction."
