    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. The study indicates that atherosclerosis is associated with impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation, which is linked to decreased production and activity of NO. Additionally, oxidative stress from superoxide (O2-) radicals, which are elevated in atherosclerotic arteries, inactivates NO, leading to the formation of peroxynitrite, a cytotoxic compound. This suggests a critical relationship where NO's biological activity is compromised in atherosclerosis, contributing to vascular dysfunction."
