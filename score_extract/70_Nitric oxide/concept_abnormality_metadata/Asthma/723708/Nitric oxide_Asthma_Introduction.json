    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a useful biochemical marker for asthma, a condition characterized by airway inflammation. The study aims to investigate how ethanol consumption may affect the measurement of NO in exhaled breath, which is relevant for diagnosing asthma. This suggests a direct relationship between NO levels and asthma diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of accurate measurement in clinical settings."
