    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to asthma through the measurement of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), which serves as a biomarker for eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthmatic patients. The correlation between elevated FeNO levels and asthma severity highlights the importance of NO in asthma management, particularly with the advent of portable analyzers that enable regular monitoring of FeNO levels at home, potentially improving patient care and treatment outcomes."
