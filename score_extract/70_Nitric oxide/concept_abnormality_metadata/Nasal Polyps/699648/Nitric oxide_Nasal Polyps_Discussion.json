    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (nNO) levels are discussed in relation to nasal polyps, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of nasal polyposis may contribute to reduced levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which in turn affects nNO concentrations. This suggests a potential link between nasal polyps and altered nitric oxide metabolism, impacting diagnostic testing for conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)."
