    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is linked to the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene through its role in sensitizing ovarian carcinoma cells to TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity. The study shows that NO, generated by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) upon interferon-γ (IFN-γ) treatment, enhances the apoptotic effects of TNF-α. Additionally, NO donors were found to inhibit NF-κB activation, which is involved in TNF-α signaling, suggesting a complex interplay between NO and TNF-α in regulating apoptosis in cancer cells."
