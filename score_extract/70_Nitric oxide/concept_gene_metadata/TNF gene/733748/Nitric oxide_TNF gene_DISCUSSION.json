    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is described as having an inhibitory effect on the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, which is crucial for the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. The interaction suggests that NO can sensitize cells to apoptosis by disrupting the TNF-α-dependent signaling pathway, highlighting a significant relationship between NO and the TNF gene in regulating cell survival and apoptosis."
