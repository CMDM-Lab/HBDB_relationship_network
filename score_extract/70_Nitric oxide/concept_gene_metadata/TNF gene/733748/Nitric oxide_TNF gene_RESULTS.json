    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is shown to inhibit the TNF-α-induced activation of the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in AD10 cells. The presence of the NO donor SNAP significantly decreased the activation caused by TNF-α, indicating a regulatory role of nitric oxide in modulating the inflammatory response mediated by TNF-α. This suggests a direct interaction where nitric oxide acts as a negative regulator of TNF-α signaling pathways."
