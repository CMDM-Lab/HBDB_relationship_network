    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is regulated at the transcriptional level by various transcription factors, including IRF-1. The activation of IRF-1 is crucial for the expression of iNOS, thereby influencing NO production in activated macrophages. This indicates a direct regulatory relationship where IRF-1 plays a significant role in modulating the expression of the iNOS gene, which in turn affects nitric oxide levels during inflammatory responses."
