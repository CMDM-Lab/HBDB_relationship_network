    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is shown to interact with sulfhydryl compounds by modifying thiol groups on critical amino acid residues of NF-κB, thereby affecting its DNA-binding ability. This thiol modification is significant in the context of TNF-α-induced oxidative stress, indicating a direct biochemical relationship between NO and sulfhydryl compounds in cellular signaling pathways."
