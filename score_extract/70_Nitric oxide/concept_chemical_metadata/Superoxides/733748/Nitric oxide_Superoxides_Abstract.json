    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) and superoxides are interconnected through their roles in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathways, particularly in relation to TNF-α-mediated effects. Superoxides are generated as a result of TNF-α stimulation and can react with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). This interaction highlights a potential regulatory mechanism where NO may influence ROS-dependent signaling pathways, although the specific regulatory role of NO in TNF-α signaling remains to be fully established."
