    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its production during inflammatory responses following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. The study notes that while plasma nitrate/nitrite levels and airway NO concentrations remained unchanged, this indicates a complex relationship where the expected increase in NO production did not occur despite inflammatory events. Nitrate and nitrite are often considered metabolites of NO, suggesting a potential link, but the lack of change in their levels implies that the NO pathway was not activated as anticipated in this specific pathological context."
