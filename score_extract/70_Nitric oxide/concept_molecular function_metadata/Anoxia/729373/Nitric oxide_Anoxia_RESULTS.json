    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is investigated in relation to anoxia, particularly regarding its role in apoptosis during anoxic conditions. The study explores how carbon monoxide (CO) can exert an anti-apoptotic effect independent of cGMP and nitric oxide synthase activity. Although NO production was not increased during anoxia, the presence of CO was able to rescue cells from apoptosis induced by anoxia, suggesting a complex interplay between NO and anoxic conditions in cellular responses."
