    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is linked to arginine metabolism through the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which converts arginine into NO. The discussion suggests that changes in arginine metabolism may influence nitric oxide levels, particularly in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The lower levels of NO in CF patients could be attributed to alterations in arginine metabolism or reduced inducible NOS activity, indicating a significant relationship between these two terms in the context of respiratory health."
