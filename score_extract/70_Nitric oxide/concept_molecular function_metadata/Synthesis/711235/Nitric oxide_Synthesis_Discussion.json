    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a product of epithelial cells, which are significant sites for its synthesis. The study discusses the relationship between fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels and eosinophilic inflammation, suggesting that NO synthesis may play a role in the inflammatory processes observed in patients with steroid-resistant asthma (SRA). The synthesis of NO is linked to the presence of eosinophils and their chemoattractant factors, indicating its importance in airway inflammation."
