    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) plays a complex role in tumor biology, influencing apoptosis in various ways. Low levels of NO are associated with increased blood flow and tumor growth, while high levels can inhibit caspase activation, thereby reducing apoptosis in surrounding lymphocytes. Conversely, high NO output can also promote apoptosis in certain contexts, indicating that the relationship between NO and apoptosis is context-dependent and influenced by local concentrations and reactive molecules present in the tumor environment."
