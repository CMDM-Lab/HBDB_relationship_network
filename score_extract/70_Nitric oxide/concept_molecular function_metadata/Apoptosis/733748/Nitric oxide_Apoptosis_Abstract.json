    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the sensitization of ovarian carcinoma cells to TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. The study shows that NO, generated through the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), enhances the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α. Furthermore, NO donors were found to sensitize the cancer cells to TNF-α, while inhibiting nitric oxide synthase blocked this sensitization, indicating a direct role of NO in modulating apoptotic pathways in response to TNF-α signaling."
