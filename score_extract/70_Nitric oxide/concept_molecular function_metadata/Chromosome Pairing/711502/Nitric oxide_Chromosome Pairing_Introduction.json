    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a key molecule involved in synaptic changes and neurodegenerative processes, particularly in diseases like Alzheimer's and ALS. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of chromosome pairing in relation to NO. The context focuses on the role of NO in synaptic loss rather than any genetic or chromosomal interactions."
