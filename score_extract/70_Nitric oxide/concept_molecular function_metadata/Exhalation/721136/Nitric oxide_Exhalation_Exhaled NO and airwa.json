    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed as a naturally occurring component in the exhaled breath of various mammalian species, including humans. The study highlights that exhaled NO is primarily sourced from the lower airways rather than from autoinhalation of endogenous NO. The measurement of fractional concentration of exhaled NO (FENO) is emphasized, indicating its relevance in respiratory physiology and potential clinical applications."
