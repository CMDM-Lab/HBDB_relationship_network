    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a significant marker detectable in exhaled breath, particularly in relation to respiratory health and diseases such as asthma and COPD. The measurement of exhaled NO has gained attention for its potential diagnostic value, indicating that NO plays a crucial role in respiratory physiology and may reflect underlying pathological processes. The relationship between NO and exhalation is underscored by its role as a signaling molecule in the respiratory tract, although the clinical implications of its measurement are still being explored."
