    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is measured in exhaled breath as a non-invasive biomarker for asthma, highlighting its significance in respiratory health. The study investigates how ethanol consumption may affect the accuracy of NO measurements in exhalation. This relationship underscores the importance of understanding exhaled NO levels in diagnosing and monitoring airway inflammation in patients."
