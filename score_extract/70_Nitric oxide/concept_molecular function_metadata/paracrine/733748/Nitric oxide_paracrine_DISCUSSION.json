    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in a paracrine signaling mechanism that influences the apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells. The study suggests that NO disrupts the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, which is part of a survival autocrine-paracrine loop. This indicates that NO can modulate the local cellular environment and affect neighboring cells' responses to TNF-α, highlighting its role in paracrine signaling within tumor biology."
