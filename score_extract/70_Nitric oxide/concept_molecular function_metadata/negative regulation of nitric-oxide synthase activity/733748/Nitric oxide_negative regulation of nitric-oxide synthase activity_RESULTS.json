    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the sensitization of human ovarian carcinoma AD10 cells to TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity. The study indicates that the presence of a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, l-NMA, negatively regulates the production of nitric oxide, thereby decreasing the sensitization effect of IFN-γ on the tumor cells. This suggests a direct relationship where the regulation of NOS activity impacts nitric oxide levels and subsequently influences cellular responses to TNF-α."
