    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is shown to influence gene expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB in TNF-α-stimulated AD10 cells. The study indicates that NO can selectively affect one of the pathways involved in NF-κB activation, suggesting a regulatory role of NO in gene expression related to inflammatory responses. The findings highlight the complex interactions between NO and gene expression mechanisms, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and inflammation."
