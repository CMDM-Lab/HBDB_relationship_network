    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted for its role in antiviral host defense and its potential protective effects through bronchodilation. The study examines the expression of NOS-2, an enzyme responsible for NO production, in the lungs of hypereosinophilic mice, suggesting that NO may act as a protective agent in the immune response against respiratory viral infections. The increased expression of NOS-2 in hypereosinophilic mice indicates a significant relationship between NO and protective mechanisms in the context of antiviral immunity."
