    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is produced in response to the activation of host cells by peptidoglycan (PGN) from Gram-positive bacteria, which stimulates various signal transduction pathways, including those involving MAPKs. This indicates that nitric oxide is a downstream product of signal transduction processes initiated by PGN, linking it to inflammatory responses in macrophages. The relationship highlights the role of NO in mediating the effects of signal transduction during immune responses."
