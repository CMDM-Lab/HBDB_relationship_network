    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the study of antioxidant activity attributed to allicin, a compound in garlic. The research hypothesizes that the antioxidant effects of garlic may involve the inhibition of NO production by cytokine-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The findings indicate that allicin significantly reduces nitrite production, suggesting a direct relationship between allicin's antioxidant activity and the modulation of NO levels in response to inflammatory stimuli."
