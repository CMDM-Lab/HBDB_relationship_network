    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its production during inflammatory responses following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. While the study observed changes in lung function, specifically reduced oxygenation index, it noted that airway nitric oxide concentrations did not significantly change, suggesting that the inflammatory response did not sufficiently impact alveolar ventilation function. The relationship indicates that while NO is involved in lung responses, its levels may not directly correlate with alveolar ventilation function under certain pathological conditions."
