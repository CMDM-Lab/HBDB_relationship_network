    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is shown to directly influence the DNA-binding ability of NF-κB by modifying its structure through thiol modification of critical amino acid residues. This interaction suggests that NO can regulate gene expression by affecting transcription factor activity, specifically reducing NF-κB's ability to bind DNA, which is crucial for inflammatory responses."
