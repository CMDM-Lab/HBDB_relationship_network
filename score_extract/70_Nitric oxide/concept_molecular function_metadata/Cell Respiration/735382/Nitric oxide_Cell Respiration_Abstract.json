    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a significant regulator of cell respiration, influencing mitochondrial function. The study indicates that high concentrations of NO can lead to both reversible and irreversible inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, particularly affecting complex I activity. This suggests that NO plays a critical role in modulating oxygen consumption in cells, especially under pathological conditions."
