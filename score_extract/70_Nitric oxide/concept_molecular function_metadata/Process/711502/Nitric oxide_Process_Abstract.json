    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the process of synapse loss during neurodegenerative conditions. The upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) suggests that NO plays a critical role in mediating synaptic changes. The signaling pathways involved, including soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK), indicate that NO is central to the processes leading to synapse elimination, highlighting its importance in neurobiology."
