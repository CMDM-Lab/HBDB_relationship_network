    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the sensitization process of tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α, particularly in the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. The relationship highlights how NO mediates cellular responses and influences various biological processes, including the induction of iNOS and the activation of transcription factors like NF-κB, which are crucial for inflammatory responses and tumor cell sensitivity."
