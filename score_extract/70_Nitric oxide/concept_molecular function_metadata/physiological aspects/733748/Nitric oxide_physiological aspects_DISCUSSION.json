    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its physiological roles in tumor biology, particularly its effects on tumor cell sensitivity to TNF-Î±-mediated cytotoxicity and its influence on immune responses. The study highlights both the physiological and pathophysiological aspects of NO, indicating its dual role in promoting blood flow and potentially inhibiting immune cell activation, which can affect tumor growth and apoptosis. This suggests a complex relationship where NO's physiological functions are intricately linked to tumor biology."
