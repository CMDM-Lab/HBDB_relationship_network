    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to the inflammatory response following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. The studies indicate that while an increase in NO production was anticipated due to inflammation, the actual measurements of plasma nitrate/nitrite and airway NO concentrations did not show significant changes. This suggests that the inflammatory events were not sufficient to trigger a high-output NO pathway, indicating a complex relationship where inflammation does not always correlate with increased NO production."
