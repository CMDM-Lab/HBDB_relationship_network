    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a biochemical marker for asthma, a condition characterized by airway inflammation. The study aims to investigate how ethanol consumption may affect the measurement of NO in exhaled breath, which is relevant for assessing inflammation in asthmatic patients. Thus, NO is directly linked to the inflammatory processes associated with asthma, indicating its role in monitoring airway inflammation."
