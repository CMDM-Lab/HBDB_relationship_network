    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its role as a biomarker for airway inflammation, particularly in asthma. The fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels correlate with eosinophilic inflammation in the airways, indicating that NO is a significant mediator in inflammatory processes. The ability to measure FeNO non-invasively allows for better management of asthma by monitoring inflammation levels and adjusting treatment accordingly."
