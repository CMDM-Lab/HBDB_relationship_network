    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), whose expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. The activation of transcription factors such as NF-ÎºB and AP-1 is crucial for iNOS gene expression, linking NO production to genetic transcription processes. The study emphasizes the role of MAPK pathways in regulating these transcription factors, thereby influencing NO synthesis in activated macrophages."
