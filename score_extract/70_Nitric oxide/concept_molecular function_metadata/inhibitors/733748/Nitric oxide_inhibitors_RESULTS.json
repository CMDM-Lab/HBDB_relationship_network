    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed as an inhibitor of the TNF-α-induced activation of the NF-κB-dependent reporter gene in AD10 cells. The presence of the NO donor SNAP significantly decreased the activation levels, indicating that nitric oxide acts as an inhibitor in this signaling pathway. This relationship highlights the role of NO in modulating inflammatory responses through its inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation."
