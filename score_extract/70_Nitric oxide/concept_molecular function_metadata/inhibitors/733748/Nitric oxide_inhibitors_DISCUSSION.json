    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is described as having an inhibitory effect on the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, which is crucial for maintaining cell survival against apoptotic stimuli. The generation of NO, either endogenously or exogenously, can disrupt the autocrine-paracrine loop that promotes cell resistance to apoptosis, indicating that NO acts as an inhibitor of this survival pathway. This relationship highlights the role of NO in sensitizing cells to apoptosis through its inhibitory actions on pro-inflammatory signaling pathways."
