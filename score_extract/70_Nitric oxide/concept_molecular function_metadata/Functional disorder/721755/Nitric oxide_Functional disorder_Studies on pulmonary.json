    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its production during inflammatory responses following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. While the study anticipated increased NO production due to inflammation, the findings indicated that plasma nitrate/nitrite and airway NO concentrations remained unchanged, suggesting that the inflammatory response was insufficient to induce significant NO output. This implies a potential link between NO levels and functional disorders related to lung injury, although the relationship is not strongly established due to conflicting findings in other studies."
