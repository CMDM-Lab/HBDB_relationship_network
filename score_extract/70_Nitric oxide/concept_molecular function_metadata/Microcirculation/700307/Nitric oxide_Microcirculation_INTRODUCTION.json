    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is identified as a crucial factor for maintaining microcirculation, particularly in the setting of sepsis. The production of NO in endothelial cells is essential for proper organ perfusion, and its inadequate production is linked to impaired microcirculation and subsequent organ failure. Experimental evidence shows that during endotoxaemia, there is a decrease in endothelium-dependent NO, highlighting its role in microcirculatory dysfunction. The relationship is further supported by changes in the arginine pathway, which affect NO production and contribute to microcirculatory impairment in sepsis."
