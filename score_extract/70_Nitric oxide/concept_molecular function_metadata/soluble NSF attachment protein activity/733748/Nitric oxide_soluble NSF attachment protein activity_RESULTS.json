    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the regulation of TNF-α mRNA expression through its inhibitory effects on the NF-κB pathway. While soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP) is mentioned as a nitric oxide donor, the direct relationship between NO and soluble NSF attachment protein activity is not explicitly detailed. The focus is primarily on NO's role in modulating inflammatory responses rather than its interaction with soluble NSF attachment protein activity."
