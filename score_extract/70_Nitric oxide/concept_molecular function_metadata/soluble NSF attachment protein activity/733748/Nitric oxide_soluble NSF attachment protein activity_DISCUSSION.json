    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is discussed in relation to its inhibitory effects on TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB, which is crucial for the expression of various genes, including those related to soluble NSF attachment protein activity. While the direct relationship between nitric oxide and soluble NSF attachment protein activity is not explicitly detailed, the modulation of TNF-α signaling by nitric oxide suggests a potential regulatory role that could influence soluble NSF attachment protein activity indirectly through the NF-κB pathway."
