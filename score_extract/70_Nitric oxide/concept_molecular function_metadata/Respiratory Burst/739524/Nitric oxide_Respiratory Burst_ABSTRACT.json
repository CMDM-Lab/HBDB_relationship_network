    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is highlighted as a potential contributor to the anticandidal functions of mononuclear phagocytes during the respiratory burst, which is a critical process for generating toxic compounds to kill pathogens like C. albicans. The relationship suggests that NO may enhance the effectiveness of the respiratory burst in immune responses against fungal infections, indicating a synergistic role in host defense mechanisms."
