    "summary": "In this context, nitric oxide (NO) is evaluated as a potential vasodilator for patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), particularly in comparison to calcium-channel blockers (CCB). While the study focuses on the acute response to inhaled NO, it indirectly relates to inspiration function by potentially improving pulmonary hemodynamics, which can enhance respiratory efficiency. However, the specific relationship between NO and inspiration function is not explicitly detailed in the context provided."
