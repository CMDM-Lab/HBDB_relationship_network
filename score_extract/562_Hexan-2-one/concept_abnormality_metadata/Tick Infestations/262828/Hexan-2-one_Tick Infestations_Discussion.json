    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one is mentioned as part of a formulation combined with benzaldehyde aimed at protecting dogs from infestations by the brown dog tick, R. sanguineus s. l. The study suggests that this formulation could enhance the effectiveness of anti-tick vaccines, thereby providing a dual approach to managing tick infestations and the diseases they transmit. The relationship indicates that Hexan-2-one may play a role in repelling ticks, contributing to the overall strategy for tick management."
