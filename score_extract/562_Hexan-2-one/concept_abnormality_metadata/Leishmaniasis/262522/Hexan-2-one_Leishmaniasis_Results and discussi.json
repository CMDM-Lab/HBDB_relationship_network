    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to the discrimination between leishmaniasis-infected and non-infected dogs. The study highlights the significance of various VOCs, including Hexan-2-one, in odor modifications associated with infections, suggesting that these changes may play a role in the survival strategies of parasites by attracting disease-transmitting vectors. Thus, Hexan-2-one is relevant in the context of leishmaniasis as a potential biomarker for infection status in dogs."
