    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and caprylic aldehyde are both mentioned as part of a broader study involving the extraction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from canine hair samples. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interaction, or significance in the context of the study. They are simply listed among other carbonyl compounds and hydrocarbons used in the analysis, indicating they are part of the same experimental framework without further elaboration on their specific roles or connections."
