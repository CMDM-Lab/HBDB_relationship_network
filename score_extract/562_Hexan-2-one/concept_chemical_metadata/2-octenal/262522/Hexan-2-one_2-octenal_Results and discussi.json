    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and 2-octenal are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in canine hair samples through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). They are part of a larger analysis aimed at identifying various VOCs, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships within the study. Their mention is primarily as components of a chromatographic analysis rather than indicating any direct relevance to each other."
