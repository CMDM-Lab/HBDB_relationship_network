    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one (2-hexanone) is specifically mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) analyzed in the odour of beagles, alongside benzaldehyde. Hexanones, as a broader category, include Hexan-2-one, indicating that the study focuses on the repellent properties of these compounds. The relationship is established through the analysis of their concentrations and their role in host odour, which is linked to tick repellency. However, the context does not delve deeply into the chemical interactions or specific functional relationships between Hexan-2-one and other hexanones beyond their classification as VOCs."
