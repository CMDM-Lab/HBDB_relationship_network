    "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and nonanal are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have been studied for their attractiveness to disease-transmitting vectors, particularly mosquitoes. Nonanal is specifically noted for its electrophysiological and behavioral effects on Culex quinquefasciatus, while hexan-2-one is listed among other compounds relevant to vector orientation. However, their direct relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon, indicating a more general association within the study of VOCs and vector attraction."
