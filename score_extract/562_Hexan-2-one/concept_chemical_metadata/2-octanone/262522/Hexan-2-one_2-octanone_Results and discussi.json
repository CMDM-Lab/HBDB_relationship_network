    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and 2-octanone are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in canine hair samples through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). They are part of a larger analysis aimed at identifying various VOCs, but there is no specific discussion of their relationship or interaction beyond their presence in the chromatogram. Thus, their connection is limited to being part of the same analytical study without further elaboration on their significance or functional relationship."
