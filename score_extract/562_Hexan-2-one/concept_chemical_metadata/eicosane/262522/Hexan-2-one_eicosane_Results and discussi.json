    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and eicosane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in canine hair samples through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships; they are simply part of a larger analysis of VOCs without any direct relevance to each other beyond their presence in the same study."
