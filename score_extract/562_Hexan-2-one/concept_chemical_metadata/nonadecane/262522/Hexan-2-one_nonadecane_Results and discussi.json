    "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and nonadecane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in canine hair samples through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, there is no specific discussion of their relationship or interaction beyond their presence in the same analytical study. They are part of a larger set of VOCs analyzed for potential associations with leishmaniasis in dogs."
