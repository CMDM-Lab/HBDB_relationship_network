    "summary": "In this context, hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their presence in the odour of beagles. The study focuses on validating an analytical method to quantify these compounds, highlighting their relative concentrations and the natural ratio of benzaldehyde to hexan-2-one in the beagle odour samples. However, the specific interactions or functional relationships between the two compounds are not discussed in detail."
