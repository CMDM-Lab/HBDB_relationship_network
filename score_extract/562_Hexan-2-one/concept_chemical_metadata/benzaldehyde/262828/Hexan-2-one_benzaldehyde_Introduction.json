    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one and benzaldehyde are analyzed as components of odour released by beagle dogs. The study aims to quantify the release rates and ratios of these compounds, suggesting that their combination may influence the perception of chemical signals to parasites. However, the specific interactions or effects of these compounds on each other are not detailed."
