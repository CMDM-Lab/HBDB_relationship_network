    "summary": "In this context, Hexan-2-one (2-hexanone) is mentioned as a compound quantified in dog odour extracts using gas chromatography, while 'adjudication' does not appear to have a direct connection to the chemical analysis or the compounds discussed. The term 'adjudication' seems out of place, as it typically refers to a legal process rather than a chemical or biological interaction, indicating no relevant relationship between the two terms."
