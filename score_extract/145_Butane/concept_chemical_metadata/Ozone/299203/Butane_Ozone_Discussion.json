    "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned as a non-halogenated hydrocarbon that replaced halogenated hydrocarbons like Freon due to environmental concerns regarding ozone layer depletion. The text discusses the health risks associated with butane inhalation, particularly its potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. However, the relationship with ozone is primarily environmental, focusing on the shift in propellant use to protect the ozone layer rather than a direct interaction between butane and ozone."
