    "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its emissions and their impact on ozone formation. The study indicates that the concentration of butane, when compared to propane, affects the maximum ozone produced during the experiment. Specifically, as the ratio of butane to propane increases, the maximum ozone production diminishes, suggesting a significant interaction between butane emissions and ozone levels in the atmosphere."
