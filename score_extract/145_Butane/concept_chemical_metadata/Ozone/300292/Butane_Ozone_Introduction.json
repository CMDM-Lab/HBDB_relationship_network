    "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a significant contributor to ozone formation in urban smog, particularly in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The study highlights the role of butane, along with propane, in the production of ozone through various emission sources, including exhaust and evaporative emissions. The research aims to understand the reactivity of these compounds in ozone production, indicating a direct relationship between butane emissions and increased ozone levels in the atmosphere."
