    "summary": "In this context, butane and ozone are indirectly related through their involvement in air quality studies, particularly in smog chamber experiments aimed at understanding ozone formation. The experiments measured the initial concentrations of hydrocarbons, including butane, to assess their contribution to ozone levels in the atmosphere. However, the specific interaction between butane and ozone is not detailed, focusing instead on their roles in broader environmental monitoring."
