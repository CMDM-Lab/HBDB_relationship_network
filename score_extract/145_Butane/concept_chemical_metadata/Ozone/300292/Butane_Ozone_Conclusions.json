    "summary": "In this context, butane and ozone are indirectly related through discussions on air quality and the reactivity of LP gas components. The study suggests that changing the formulation of LP gas to include more propane, which is less reactive than butane, could help reduce ozone formation in the atmosphere. However, the specific interaction between butane and ozone is not deeply explored, focusing instead on the broader implications for air quality improvement."
