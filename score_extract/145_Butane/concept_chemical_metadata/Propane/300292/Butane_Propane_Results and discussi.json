    "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are both discussed as components of liquefied petroleum (LP) gas, with propane being more prevalent in ambient air samples compared to butane. The analysis indicates that while both gases are used as domestic fuels, their emissions and concentrations differ, with propane being more abundant in LP gas and butane being more concentrated in exhaust emissions from fossil fuel combustion. This suggests a relationship based on their usage and environmental presence, but does not delve into their chemical interactions or specific functional roles."
