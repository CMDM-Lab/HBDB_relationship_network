    "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are discussed as components of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas) in relation to their reactivity and impact on air quality. The recommendation to increase propane concentration over butane is based on propane's lower reactivity, suggesting a direct relationship where the choice of gas formulation can influence environmental outcomes, particularly ozone formation. This indicates a significant connection between the two gases in terms of their chemical properties and implications for air quality management."
