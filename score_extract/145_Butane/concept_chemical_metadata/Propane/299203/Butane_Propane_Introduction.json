    "summary": "In this context, butane and propane are both identified as aliphatic hydrocarbons commonly found in products like lighter fluid and aerosol sprays. The text discusses the toxicological implications of butane inhalation, particularly in cases of abuse, while mentioning that accidental inhalation often involves a mixture of butane, propane, and isobutane. However, the relationship between butane and propane is not explored in detail beyond their classification as similar hydrocarbons used in similar applications."
