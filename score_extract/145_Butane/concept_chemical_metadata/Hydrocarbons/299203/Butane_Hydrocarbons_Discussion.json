    "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a specific type of hydrocarbon with notable effects on the central nervous system (CNS) due to its lipophilic properties. The inhalation of butane, categorized under hydrocarbons, is linked to serious health risks, including cardiac arrhythmias and potential fatal outcomes. The relationship emphasizes butane's role as a volatile hydrocarbon that can sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, leading to dangerous physiological responses."
