    "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned as a non-halogenated hydrocarbon that replaced halogenated hydrocarbons, such as Freon, in aerosol propellants due to environmental concerns. The text discusses the health risks associated with inhaling butane, particularly its potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias, contrasting it with the dangers posed by halogenated hydrocarbons. This indicates a relationship where butane is categorized under hydrocarbons while also being compared to halogenated variants regarding safety and health implications."
