    "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned in relation to its reactivity compared to propane in the formulation of liquefied petroleum gas (LP gas) for improving air quality in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The discussion focuses on the need for specific studies on the reactivity of butane and its impact on ozone formation, indicating its significance in environmental chemistry. However, since both mentions refer to the same compound, the relationship is more about its properties rather than an interaction with another distinct entity."
