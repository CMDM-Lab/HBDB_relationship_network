    "summary": "In this context, butane is mentioned twice as part of a sample preparation process involving t-butanol and butane from a lighter refill found at a crime scene. The analysis focuses on comparing chromatograms of the butane sample from the scene with a known butane sample. The relationship is purely procedural, as both instances refer to the same chemical compound used in forensic analysis without any additional context or interaction described."
