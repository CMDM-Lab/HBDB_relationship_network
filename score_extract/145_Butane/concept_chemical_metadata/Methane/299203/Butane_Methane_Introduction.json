    "summary": "In this context, butane and methane are both mentioned as aliphatic hydrocarbons commonly found in inhalants that are abused for their psychoactive effects. While butane is specifically described in terms of its use as a propellant and its associated health risks, methane is not elaborated upon in detail. Their relationship lies in their classification as hydrocarbons and their presence in inhalant products, but no direct interaction or comparison is made between the two."
