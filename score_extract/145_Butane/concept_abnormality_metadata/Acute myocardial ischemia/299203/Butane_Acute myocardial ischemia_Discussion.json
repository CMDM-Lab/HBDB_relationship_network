    "summary": "In this context, butane inhalation is implicated as a cause of asphyxia, which subsequently leads to acute myocardial ischemic lesions. The text suggests that the pathophysiological effects of butane contribute to severe respiratory distress, resulting in insufficient oxygen supply to the heart, thereby causing ischemia. This establishes a direct link between butane exposure and acute myocardial ischemia through the mechanism of asphyxia."
