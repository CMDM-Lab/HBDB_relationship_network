    "summary": "In this context, butane is linked to ventricular fibrillation through its anesthetic effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and its potential to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline. Inhalation of butane can lead to fatal arrhythmias, particularly ventricular fibrillation, following sudden physical stress or emotional triggers. The text suggests that butane exposure may contribute to sudden cardiac events, highlighting a critical relationship between the substance and the risk of arrhythmias."
