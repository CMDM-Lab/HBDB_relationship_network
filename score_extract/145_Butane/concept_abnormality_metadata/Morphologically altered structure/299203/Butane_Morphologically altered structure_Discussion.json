    "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its lipophilic properties and potential effects on the myocardium, leading to fatal arrhythmias. However, there is no direct mention of morphologically altered structures specifically linked to butane intoxication. The text indicates that no pathognomonic morphological changes have been identified for butane exposure, suggesting a lack of established structural alterations associated with its toxicity."
