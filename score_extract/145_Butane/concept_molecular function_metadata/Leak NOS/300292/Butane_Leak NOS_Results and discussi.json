    "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its consumption as a domestic fuel and its emissions profile compared to propane. The mention of 'leak NOS' refers to the potential sources of propane emissions from LP gas leaks and incomplete combustion. While butane is noted for its higher concentration in exhaust emissions, the relationship with leak NOS is indirect, focusing on the comparative analysis of emissions rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship."
