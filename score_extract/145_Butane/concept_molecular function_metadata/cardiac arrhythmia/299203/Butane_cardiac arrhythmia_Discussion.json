    "summary": "In this context, butane is linked to cardiac arrhythmia through its anesthetic and narcotic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Inhalation of butane is suspected to sensitize the myocardium to adrenaline, potentially leading to fatal arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, especially during stress or physical exertion. The text suggests that hypoxia, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmia are mechanisms contributing to sudden death associated with butane inhalation, highlighting a significant health risk related to its use."
