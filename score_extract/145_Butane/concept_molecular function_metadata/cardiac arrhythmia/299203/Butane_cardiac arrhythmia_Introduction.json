    "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a volatile substance commonly abused through inhalation, which can lead to severe health consequences, including cardiac arrhythmia. The inhalation of butane can trigger sudden sniffing death syndrome, where a burst of catecholamines may induce ventricular fibrillation, resulting in fatal arrhythmias. This highlights a direct and dangerous relationship between butane abuse and cardiac arrhythmia, particularly in the context of inhalant-related deaths."
