    "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a liquefied petroleum gas that can lead to fatal outcomes when abused as an inhalant. The report discusses two cases of sudden death linked to the intentional inhalation of butane from a cigarette lighter refill. The inhalation of butane acts as a simple asphyxiant, displacing oxygen and causing toxicity, which can result in death. This establishes a direct and critical relationship between butane exposure and fatal outcomes."
