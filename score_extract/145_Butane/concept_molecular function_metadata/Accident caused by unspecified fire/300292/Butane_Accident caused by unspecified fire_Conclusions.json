    "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its presence in ambient air and emissions from fossil fuel combustion, particularly LP gas. However, there is no direct mention of an accident caused by an unspecified fire related to butane. The focus is on the comparative concentrations of butane and propane in the environment, without any explicit connection to fire incidents or accidents."
