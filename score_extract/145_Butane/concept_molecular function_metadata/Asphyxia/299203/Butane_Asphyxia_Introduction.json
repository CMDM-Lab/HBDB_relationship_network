    "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a volatile substance commonly abused through inhalation, which can lead to asphyxia. As a simple asphyxiant, butane displaces oxygen in the air, preventing it from reaching vital tissues and organs, thereby causing toxicity and potentially resulting in suffocation or death. The relationship is critical, as inhalation of butane directly contributes to the risk of asphyxia in users."
