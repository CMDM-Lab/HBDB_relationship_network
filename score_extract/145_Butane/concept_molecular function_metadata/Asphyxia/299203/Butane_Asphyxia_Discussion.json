    "summary": "In this context, butane inhalation is directly linked to asphyxia, which is identified as the primary cause of acute myocardial lesions in the cases discussed. The inhalation of butane leads to a lack of oxygen, resulting in asphyxia and subsequent death. The pathophysiological changes in the lungs due to butane exposure are highlighted as contributing factors to the asphyxia experienced by the individuals, indicating a critical and harmful relationship between the two terms."
