    "summary": "In this context, butane is identified as a volatile substance commonly abused through inhalation, which can lead to respiratory depression among other serious health risks. The inhalation of butane displaces oxygen in the lungs, resulting in reduced oxygen availability to vital organs, thereby causing respiratory depression. This relationship highlights the dangers associated with inhalant abuse, particularly in children and adolescents."
