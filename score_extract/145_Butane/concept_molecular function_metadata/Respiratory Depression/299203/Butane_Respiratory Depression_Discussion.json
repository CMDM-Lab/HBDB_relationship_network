    "summary": "In this context, butane is linked to respiratory depression through its anesthetic and narcotic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Inhalation of butane can lead to hypoxia and respiratory depression, which are identified as potential mechanisms for sudden death associated with volatile inhalant abuse. The lipophilic nature of butane allows it to accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, including the brain, exacerbating its depressant effects on respiration."
