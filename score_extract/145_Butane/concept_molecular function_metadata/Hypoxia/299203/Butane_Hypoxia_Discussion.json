    "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its lipophilicity, which allows it to integrate into the lipid layer of the basal capillary membrane, potentially obstructing microcirculation. This obstruction may contribute to chronic hypoxia, which is identified as a significant factor leading to ischemic changes in the myocardium. The relationship suggests that butane exposure could exacerbate hypoxic conditions, particularly in the context of chronic lung issues."
