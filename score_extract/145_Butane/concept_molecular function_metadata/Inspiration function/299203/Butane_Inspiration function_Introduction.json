    "summary": "In this context, butane is described as a gaseous propellant that can be abused through inhalation, leading to asphyxiation by displacing oxygen. This displacement directly impacts the inspiration function, as it prevents oxygen from reaching vital tissues and organs, potentially resulting in fatal outcomes. The report highlights cases of sudden death linked to butane inhalation, emphasizing its toxic effects on respiratory function."
