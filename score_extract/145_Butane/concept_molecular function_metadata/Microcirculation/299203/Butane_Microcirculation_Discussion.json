    "summary": "In this context, butane is discussed in relation to its lipophilicity, which allows it to integrate into the lipid layer of the basal capillary membrane, potentially obstructing microcirculation. This blockage may contribute to ischemic changes in the myocardium, indicating a significant relationship between butane exposure and impaired microcirculation, particularly in the context of chronic hypoxia and its effects on cardiac health."
