    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed as a potential marker for systemic inflammation that may be induced by viral infections, particularly rhinovirus. The text suggests that urinary LTE4 levels could reflect a virus-induced systemic component, which may influence the responsiveness to montelukast, a medication used for asthma. However, the lack of direct viral specimen collection limits the ability to definitively assess the relationship between viral exposure and LTE4 levels."
