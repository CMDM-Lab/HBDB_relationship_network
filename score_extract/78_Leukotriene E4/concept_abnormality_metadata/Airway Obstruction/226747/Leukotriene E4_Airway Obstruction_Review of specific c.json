    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is linked to airway obstruction, particularly in asthma exacerbations. Elevated urinary LTE4 levels correlate with decreased lung function and increased airway obstruction, as indicated by a fall in FEV1 during challenges. While LTE4 levels rise during asthma exacerbations, their predictive value for airway obstruction varies among patients, suggesting a complex relationship influenced by factors like aspirin sensitivity and eosinophil levels."
