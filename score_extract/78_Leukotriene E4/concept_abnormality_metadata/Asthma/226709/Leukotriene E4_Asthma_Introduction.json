    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (uLTE4) is identified as a significant biomarker for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), which affects a subset of asthmatics. The release of cysteinyl leukotrienes, including uLTE4, is linked to bronchoconstriction triggered by aspirin ingestion. Elevated levels of uLTE4 are also observed in clinically stable asthmatics, indicating its relevance in asthma pathology and management."
