    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is measured as a biomarker in children with mild-to-moderate asthma during a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of treatments like fluticasone propionate (FP) and montelukast. The study collects asthma outcome data alongside LTE4 levels to evaluate the relationship between leukotriene levels and asthma control, indicating that LTE4 may play a role in asthma pathophysiology and treatment response."
