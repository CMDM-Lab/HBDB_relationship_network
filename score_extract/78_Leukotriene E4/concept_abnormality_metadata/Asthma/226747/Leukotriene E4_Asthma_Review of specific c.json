    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is highlighted as a potential biomarker for characterizing different asthma phenotypes, such as aspirin-sensitive and eosinophilic asthma. The measurement of urinary LTE4 is suggested to be important for understanding the relationship between eicosanoid biology and asthma, indicating its relevance in asthma research and treatment strategies. However, the specific interactions between LTE4 and asthma phenotypes require further investigation."
