    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is associated with asthma, particularly in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and adult-onset severe asthma. Higher urinary levels of LTE4 are noted in these populations, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for characterizing asthma phenotypes. The measurement of LTE4 is recommended for studies focusing on the eicosanoid pathway and asthma characterization."
