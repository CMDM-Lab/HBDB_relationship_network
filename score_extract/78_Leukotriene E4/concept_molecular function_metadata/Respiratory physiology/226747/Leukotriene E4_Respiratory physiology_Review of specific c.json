    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to respiratory physiology, particularly in the context of asthma. Elevated urinary LTE4 levels are associated with lung function metrics, airway obstruction during asthma exacerbations, and specific asthma phenotypes. However, the associations are not robust enough to establish LTE4 as a reliable surrogate marker for lung function or asthma severity, indicating a complex relationship with respiratory physiology that requires further investigation."
