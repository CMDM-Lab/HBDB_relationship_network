    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is presented as a biomarker associated with the inflammatory response, particularly in relation to asthma and its treatment. Higher LTE4 levels may indicate a broader inflammatory response to various triggers, while its ratio with FENO suggests differing responses to therapies like montelukast and FP. The study implies that LTE4 serves as a general indicator of inflammation, potentially influenced by nonallergic triggers such as tobacco smoke, which can elevate LTE4 levels and alter treatment responsiveness."
