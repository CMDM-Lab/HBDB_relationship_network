    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to its interaction with the drug montelukast, which is used to manage asthma symptoms. The study highlights how LTE4 levels influence the effectiveness of montelukast, indicating that higher LTE4 levels may lead to poorer responses to the drug. This suggests a significant relationship between LTE4 and drug interactions, particularly in the context of asthma treatment in children."
