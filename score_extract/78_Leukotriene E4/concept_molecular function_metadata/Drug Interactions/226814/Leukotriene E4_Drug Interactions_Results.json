    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to the effects of montelukast treatment on albuterol usage among children with varying cotinine levels. The study highlights a significant interaction between LTE4 levels and drug usage, suggesting that montelukast may influence the effectiveness of albuterol in patients with different LTE4 levels. However, the specific nature of drug interactions involving LTE4 is not deeply explored, limiting the understanding of its role in pharmacological contexts."
