    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is implicated in inflammation, particularly in relation to nonallergic asthma triggers such as tobacco smoke. Increased urinary LTE4 levels may indicate systemic inflammation, which can be associated with respiratory conditions. The study suggests a potential link between LTE4 and inflammatory responses, particularly in smokers, highlighting its role as a biomarker for inflammation in asthma management."
