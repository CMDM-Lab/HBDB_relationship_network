    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed as a marker of lung cysteinyl leukotriene activity, with its synthesis being influenced by various factors such as asthma exacerbations and drug interventions. The synthesis of LTE4 is notably reduced by drugs that block cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis, indicating a direct relationship between LTE4 levels and its synthesis pathways. This suggests that understanding LTE4 synthesis is crucial for evaluating its role in asthma and related conditions."
