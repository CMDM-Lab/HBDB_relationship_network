    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is linked to the use of 5-LO inhibitors, which are shown to significantly reduce urinary LTE4 levels by 40% to 75%. The effectiveness of these inhibitors in decreasing LTE4 levels is influenced by the initial urinary LTE4 concentration, indicating a direct relationship between LTE4 and its inhibitors in managing asthma exacerbations and responses to allergens and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs."
