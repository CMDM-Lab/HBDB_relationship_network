    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to its excretion levels, particularly in the context of asthma and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Increased urinary LTE4 excretion is noted as a response to tobacco smoking, indicating a potential link between LTE4 levels and excretory function. The study suggests that monitoring LTE4 could provide insights into inflammatory responses and asthma management, particularly in children exposed to ETS."
