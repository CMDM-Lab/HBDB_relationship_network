    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is measured in urine samples to assess its excretory function in patients with Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (AERD). The study found that urinary excretion of LTE4 was higher in AERD subjects compared to controls, and its levels correlated with bronchial symptoms. This indicates that LTE4 plays a role in the excretory function related to inflammatory responses in AERD."
