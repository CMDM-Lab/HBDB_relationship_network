    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to its role as a mediator in allergic responses, particularly in the early and late asthmatic reactions (EAR and LAR). The study highlights that urinary excretion of LTE4 is not reduced despite the inhibition of airway obstruction by glucocorticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists. This suggests that while LTE4 is involved in the inflammatory response, its excretion may not directly correlate with the excretory function in the context of airway inflammation and treatment efficacy."
