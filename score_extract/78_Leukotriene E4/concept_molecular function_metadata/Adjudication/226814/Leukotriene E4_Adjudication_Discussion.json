    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to asthma treatment and the effectiveness of different therapies, including inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) like montelukast. The mention of adjudication refers to the study's design, which allows for precise measurement of treatment responses in susceptible patient subgroups. While LTE4 levels may inform treatment choices, the term 'adjudication' is more about the study's methodology rather than a direct relationship with LTE4 itself."
