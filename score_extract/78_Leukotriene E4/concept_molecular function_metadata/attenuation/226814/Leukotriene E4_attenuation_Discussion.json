    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is associated with the attenuation of asthma symptoms, particularly in children undergoing montelukast treatment. The study indicates that higher LTE4 levels correlate with increased albuterol usage, but this association diminishes during montelukast treatment, suggesting that montelukast may effectively reduce LTE4's impact on asthma severity. This highlights the role of LTE4 in modulating asthma responses and the potential for montelukast to attenuate these effects."
