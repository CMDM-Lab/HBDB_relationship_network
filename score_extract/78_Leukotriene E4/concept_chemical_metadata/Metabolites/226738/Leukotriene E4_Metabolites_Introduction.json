    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is identified as a member of the cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are metabolites derived from arachidonic acid. The text discusses LTE4 and its metabolites, such as leukotriene F4 (LTF4) and N-acetyl leukotriene E4, highlighting their roles in inflammatory respiratory diseases like asthma and cystic fibrosis. This indicates a direct relationship where LTE4 is a specific metabolite involved in inflammatory processes."
