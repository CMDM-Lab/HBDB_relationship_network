    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is discussed in relation to its metabolites, specifically N-acetyl-LTE4. The study evaluates the specificity of antibodies against various leukotrienes, including LTE4 and its metabolite, highlighting that the immunobeads show comparable specificity for both. This suggests a direct relationship between LTE4 and its metabolites in the context of immunological assays and their relevance in studying conditions like bronchial asthma."
