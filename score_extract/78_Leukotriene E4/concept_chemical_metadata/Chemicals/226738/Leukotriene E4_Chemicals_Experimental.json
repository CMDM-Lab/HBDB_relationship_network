    "summary": "In this context, Leukotriene E4 (LTE4) is mentioned as part of a mixture of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys LTs) used in a highly selective and sensitive analytical method for quantifying biomarkers in biological samples from asthma patients. The term 'chemicals' broadly encompasses the various reagents and substances, including LTE4, utilized in the study, indicating that LTE4 is one of the specific chemicals analyzed. However, the relationship is primarily about LTE4 being a component of a larger group of chemicals used for analysis rather than a detailed interaction or functional relationship."
