    "summary": "In this context, kynurenine and indole are related through the kynurenine pathway, where kynurenine serves as a substrate for the production of kynurenic acid, an NMDA antagonist. The stimulation of indole amine 2,3-dioxygenase by oxygen leads to increased kynurenine levels, which may enhance kynurenic acid production. This relationship highlights the biochemical interplay between these two compounds in response to hyperbaric oxygen conditions."
