    "summary": "In this context, kynurenine is discussed as a substrate in the kynurenine pathway, which leads to the production of kynurenic acid, an NMDA antagonist. While amines are not directly mentioned in relation to kynurenine, the kynurenine pathway involves the metabolism of tryptophan, which is an amino acid and a type of amine. The relationship is indirect, as kynurenine's role in the pathway may influence the levels of certain amines, but no specific interactions are detailed."
