    "summary": "In this context, kynurenine is linked to convulsions through its metabolic pathway, which produces quinolinic acid, a potent excitatory compound. The stimulation of the kynurenine pathway by hyperbaric oxygen may lead to increased levels of quinolinic acid, potentially causing convulsions. Conversely, recovery from convulsions may involve increased production of kynurenic acid, an NMDA antagonist, suggesting a complex interplay between these compounds in the context of oxygen exposure and seizure activity."
