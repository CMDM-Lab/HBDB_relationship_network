    "summary": "In this context, kynurenine is linked to oxygen toxicity through its role in the kynurenine pathway, which produces kynurenic acid, an NMDA antagonist. The production of kynurenic acid may be stimulated by oxygen, suggesting a potential protective mechanism against excitotoxicity during conditions of oxygen poisoning. However, the exact relationship between kynurenine levels and oxygen toxicity remains unclear, particularly regarding the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on the pathway's enzyme activity."
