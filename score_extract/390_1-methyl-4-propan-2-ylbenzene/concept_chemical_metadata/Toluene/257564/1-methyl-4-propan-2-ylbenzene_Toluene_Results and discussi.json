    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene (also known as isobutylbenzene) and toluene are both mentioned as compounds analyzed in air samples using gas chromatography. However, the context does not provide any specific information about their relationship, interactions, or comparative significance beyond their identification as components of the air samples. They are part of a broader analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) but lack a direct connection in the discussion."
