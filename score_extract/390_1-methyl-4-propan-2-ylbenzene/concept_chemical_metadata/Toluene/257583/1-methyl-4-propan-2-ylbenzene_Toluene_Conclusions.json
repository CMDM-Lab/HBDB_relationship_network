    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene (also known as 4-isopropyltoluene) and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in soil samples from construction and demolition waste recycling facilities. They are mentioned together in the context of leachability tests, where toluene is noted for its high leachability compared to other compounds. However, the specific relationship between 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as VOCs present in the samples."
