    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene, specifically (E)-Î²-ocimene, is identified as a prominent member of the monoterpenes class. It plays a crucial role in plant defense mechanisms, emitted in response to herbivore damage and pathogen infection. The context highlights its significance in attracting natural enemies of herbivores and inducing plant defense genes, underscoring its functional relevance as a monoterpene in ecological interactions."
