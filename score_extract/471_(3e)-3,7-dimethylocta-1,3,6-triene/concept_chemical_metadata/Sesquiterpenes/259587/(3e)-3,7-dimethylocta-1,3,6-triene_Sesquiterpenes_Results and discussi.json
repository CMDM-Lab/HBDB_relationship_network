    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is identified as a product of the enzyme (E)-β-ocimene synthase (MtEBOS) from M. truncatula, which specifically produces (E)-β-ocimene rather than sesquiterpenes. While sesquiterpenes are a broader class of terpenes, the context indicates that MtEBOS does not function in their production, highlighting a distinction between this compound and sesquiterpenes."
