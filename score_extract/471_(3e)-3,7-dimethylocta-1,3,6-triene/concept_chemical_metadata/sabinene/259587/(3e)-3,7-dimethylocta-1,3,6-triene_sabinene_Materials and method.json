    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and sabinene are both mentioned in the context of terpene synthases and their sequence comparisons in various plant species. However, the context does not provide specific information about their functional relationship or interactions. They are part of a broader discussion on monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases, indicating they belong to the same category of compounds but lack direct relevance to each other in this context."
