    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene and linalool are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from tobacco plants treated with jasmonic acid (MeJA) in response to powdery mildew infection. While the context highlights their presence among other terpenes released from the plants, it does not detail any specific interaction or functional relationship between these two compounds, indicating they are part of a broader response to stress rather than directly related to each other."
