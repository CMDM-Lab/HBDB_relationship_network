    "summary": "In this context, (3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene, specifically the volatile compound (E)-Î²-ocimene, is implicated in plant signaling and defense mechanisms. It plays a role in signal transduction by activating ethylene release and defense-related gene expression in uninfested plants when they perceive volatiles from damaged neighbors. This indicates a significant relationship between the compound and the process of signal transduction in plant defense responses."
