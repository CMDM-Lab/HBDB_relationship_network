    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is mentioned in the context of plant responses to pathogens, specifically regarding the induction of genes related to defense mechanisms. The study indicates that pre-treatment with this compound, along with others like MeJA and (E)-2-hexenal, leads to significant changes in the expression of genes associated with reducing the severity of powdery mildew infections. This suggests a direct relationship between the volatile compound and the induction of defense-related genes in tobacco plants."
