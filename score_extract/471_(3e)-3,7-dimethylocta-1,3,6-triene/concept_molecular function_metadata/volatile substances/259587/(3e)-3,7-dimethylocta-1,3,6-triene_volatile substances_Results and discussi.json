    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene, specifically the (E)-Î²-ocimene isomer, is identified as a volatile substance that plays a role in plant signaling and defense mechanisms. It is emitted by plants in response to herbivore damage, influencing neighboring plants' defense responses. This highlights the functional significance of (3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene as a volatile compound involved in ecological interactions."
