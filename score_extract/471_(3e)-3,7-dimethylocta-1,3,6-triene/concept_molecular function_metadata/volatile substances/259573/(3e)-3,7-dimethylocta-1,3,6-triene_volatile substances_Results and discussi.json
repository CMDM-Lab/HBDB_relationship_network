    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from tobacco plants treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in response to powdery mildew infection. This compound, along with other terpenes, plays a role in plant defense and signaling, indicating its classification as a volatile substance. The study highlights the significance of these emissions in the context of plant responses to biotic stress."
