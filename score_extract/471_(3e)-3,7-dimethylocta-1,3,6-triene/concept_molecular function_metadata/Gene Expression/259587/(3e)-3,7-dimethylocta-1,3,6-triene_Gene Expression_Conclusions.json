    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene, identified as (E)-Î²-ocimene, is linked to gene expression through the regulation of terpene synthase gene expression in M. truncatula. The study indicates that herbivore damage leads to increased volatile release, which correlates with the accumulation of transcripts for the MtEBOS gene, suggesting that gene expression is crucial for terpene production in response to environmental stressors like wounding."
