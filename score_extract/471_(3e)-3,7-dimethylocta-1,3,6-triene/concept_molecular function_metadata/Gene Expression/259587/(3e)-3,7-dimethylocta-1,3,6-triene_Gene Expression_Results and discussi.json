    "summary": "(3e)-3,7-dimethylocta-1,3,6-triene, specifically (E)-β-ocimene, is a volatile compound produced in response to herbivore damage in plants, indicating a relationship with gene expression. The context suggests that the low levels of (E)-β-ocimene in undamaged plants may be due to low constitutive gene expression. This implies that gene expression plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of this compound in response to environmental stressors."
