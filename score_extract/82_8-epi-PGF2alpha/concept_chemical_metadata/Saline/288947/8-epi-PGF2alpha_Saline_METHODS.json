    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is used as a biomarker in a test solution that is nebulized with saline (0.9% solution) to simulate tidal breathing. The saline serves as a diluent for the biomarker, facilitating its delivery through the nebulizer and into the respiratory system for analysis. The relationship is primarily functional, as saline is essential for the preparation and administration of the biomarker solution."
