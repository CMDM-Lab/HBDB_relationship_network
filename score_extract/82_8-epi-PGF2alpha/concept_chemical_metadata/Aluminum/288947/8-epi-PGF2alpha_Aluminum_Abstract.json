    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using various condenser coatings, including aluminum. The study indicates that aluminum coating results in significantly lower concentrations of 8-isoprostane compared to silicone and glass coatings. This suggests that the choice of material for the condenser can affect the recovery of this biomarker, highlighting a potential limitation of using aluminum in such measurements."
