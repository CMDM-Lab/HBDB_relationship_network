    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker that can be measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), while aluminum is referenced in relation to the efficiency of different condenser coatings for collecting EBC. The study suggests that aluminum coatings are less effective compared to silicone or glass coatings for recovering biomarkers like 8-epi-PGF2alpha, indicating a potential negative impact of aluminum on the measurement accuracy of this biomarker."
