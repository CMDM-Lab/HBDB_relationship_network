    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha and nitrate are both measured as part of a biochemical analysis involving exhaled breath condensate (EBC). While nitrate is quantified using a colorimetric assay, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is assessed through a competitive enzyme immunoassay. However, the relationship between these two compounds is not explicitly discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of biomarkers without direct interaction or significance highlighted in the context."
