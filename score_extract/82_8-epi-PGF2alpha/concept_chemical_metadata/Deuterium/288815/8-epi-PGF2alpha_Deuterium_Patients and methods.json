    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed in breath condensate samples, where deuterium-labeled standards are used as internal controls during the immunoseparation process. The use of deuterium-labeled compounds helps in quantifying the levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha accurately in the samples, indicating a methodological relationship where deuterium serves as a tracer in the analysis of this biomarker."
