    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a biomarker related to the measurement of various chemicals, specifically nitrate and nitrite concentrations, in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The study employs colorimetric assays and enzyme immunoassays to quantify these chemicals, indicating that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may be part of a broader analysis involving chemical measurements, but no direct relationship or interaction between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and the chemicals is established."
