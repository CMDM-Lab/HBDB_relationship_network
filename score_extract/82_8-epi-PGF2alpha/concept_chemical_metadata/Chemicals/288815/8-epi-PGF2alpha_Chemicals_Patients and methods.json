    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed as part of breath condensate samples collected for testing, which involves various chemicals used in the immunoseparation process. The mention of 'chemicals' refers broadly to the reagents and standards utilized in the analysis, but there is no specific discussion of how 8-epi-PGF2alpha interacts with or relates to these chemicals beyond its role as a target for measurement in the study."
