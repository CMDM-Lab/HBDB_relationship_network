    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is identified as a predominant isoprostane used as a quantitative index of oxidative stress in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is measured in breath condensate, which reflects airway inflammation and oxidative stress in response to various inflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin-6. The relationship indicates that 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels can serve as a biomarker for oxidative stress triggered by inflammatory stimuli in COPD patients."
