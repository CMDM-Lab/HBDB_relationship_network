    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is directly linked to peroxidation as it is produced through free radical-induced peroxidation of arachidonic acid on plasma membrane phospholipids. The study highlights that oxidative stress, indicated by increased levels of 8-isoprostane, is present in children with asthma, suggesting a significant relationship between oxidative processes and the production of this eicosanoid."
