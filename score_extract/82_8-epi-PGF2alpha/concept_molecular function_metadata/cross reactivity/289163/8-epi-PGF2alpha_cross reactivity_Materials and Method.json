    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to cross-reactivity through the analysis of immunoreactive materials in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The study assesses the specificity of anti-8-isoprostane and anti-PGE2 sera, indicating that both 8-epi-PGF2alpha and PGE2 may exhibit similar immunologic profiles, which could lead to cross-reactivity in assays. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the specificity of the antibodies rather than a direct interaction between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and cross-reactivity itself."
