    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to cross-reactivity through the measurement of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) using a specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The assay demonstrates 100% cross-reactivity with 8-isoprostane, indicating that the assay can accurately measure this compound without interference from prostaglandin analogues. This relationship highlights the specificity of the assay in detecting 8-epi-PGF2alpha and its analogues in biological samples."
