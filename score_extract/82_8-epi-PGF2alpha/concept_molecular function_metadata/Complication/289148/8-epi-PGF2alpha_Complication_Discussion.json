    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, represented by 8-isoprostane, is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study indicates a positive correlation between 8-isoprostane levels in exhaled breath and plasma, suggesting that elevated oxidative stress may contribute to chronic cardiovascular complications associated with OSA. This relationship highlights the potential of 8-isoprostane as a biomarker for monitoring complications in OSA patients."
