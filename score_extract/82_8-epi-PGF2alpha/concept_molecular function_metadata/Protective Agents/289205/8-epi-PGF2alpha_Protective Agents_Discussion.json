    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a marker of oxidative stress and airway inflammation, particularly in response to ozone exposure. Protective agents, such as inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide and beclomethasone, are discussed in relation to their effects on 8-isoprostane levels, which are related to 8-epi-PGF2alpha. The study indicates that while some corticosteroids may have protective effects against inflammatory responses, the specific impact on 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels remains unclear, suggesting a complex interaction between these agents and oxidative stress markers in the airways."
