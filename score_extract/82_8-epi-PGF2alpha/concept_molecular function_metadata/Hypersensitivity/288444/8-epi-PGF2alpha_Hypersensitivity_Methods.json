    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is analyzed as a dependent variable in relation to various respiratory symptoms and lung function parameters. While hypersensitivity is not explicitly mentioned, the respiratory symptoms assessed (such as cough and shortness of breath) could be indicative of hypersensitivity reactions. However, the direct relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and hypersensitivity is not clearly established, making the connection more suggestive than definitive."
