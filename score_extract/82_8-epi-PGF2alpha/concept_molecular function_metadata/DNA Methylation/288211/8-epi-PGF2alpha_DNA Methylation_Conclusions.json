    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to DNA methylation through the assessment of oxidative stress markers and their impact on global DNA methylation levels. The study highlights a significant negative correlation between oxidative stress (indicated by 8-OHdG) and DNA methylation in leukocytes, suggesting that increased oxidative damage may lead to alterations in DNA methylation patterns. However, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is not explicitly mentioned as a direct factor influencing DNA methylation, limiting the strength of their relationship."
