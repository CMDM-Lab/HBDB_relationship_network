    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is measured in exhaled breath of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) at two time points: before sleeping and upon waking. The study finds higher levels of this marker in the morning, suggesting that oxidative stress may be influenced by sleep patterns and the severity of OSA. The reduction of 8-epi-PGF2alpha after waking indicates a potential link between sleep duration and oxidative stress levels, highlighting the importance of monitoring this marker in relation to sleep health."
