    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is discussed in relation to obesity and asthma. The study indicates that while obesity increases airway oxidative stress, there is no synergism observed between plasma and exhaled levels of 8-isoprostanes. This suggests that the relationship between oxidative stress and asthma severity may not be straightforward, indicating a lack of direct interaction or enhancement between these factors."
