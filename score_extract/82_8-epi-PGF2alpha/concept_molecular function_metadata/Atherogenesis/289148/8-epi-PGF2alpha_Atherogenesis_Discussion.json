    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, represented as 8-isoprostane, is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are suggested to contribute to atherogenesis. The study indicates a positive correlation between 8-isoprostane levels in exhaled breath and plasma in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), highlighting its potential role as a biomarker for oxidative stress that may lead to cardiovascular complications associated with atherogenesis. The findings suggest that elevated oxidative stress markers like 8-isoprostane could be indicative of increased risk for atherogenic processes in OSA patients."
