    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress in the airways following ozone exposure, which relates to respiratory physiology. The study indicates that while lung function metrics like FEV1 and FVC return to baseline after ozone exposure, levels of 8-isoprostane remain elevated, suggesting a persistent oxidative stress response that may impact respiratory health. This highlights the relevance of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in understanding airway inflammation and oxidative damage in respiratory physiology."
