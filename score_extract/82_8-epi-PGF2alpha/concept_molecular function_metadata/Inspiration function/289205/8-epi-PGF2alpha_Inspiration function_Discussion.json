    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is mentioned as a marker of oxidative stress in the lungs following ozone exposure, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with inspiration function. The study focuses on inflammatory responses and cellular changes in the lungs, without establishing how 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels might influence or correlate with the mechanics of inspiration or lung function. Thus, while both terms are relevant to respiratory health, their connection is not explicitly defined."
