    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is linked to apnea through its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane increase after episodes of nocturnal apnea and decrease with CPAP therapy, suggesting a relationship between oxidative stress and the physiological effects of apnea. This connection highlights the potential of measuring 8-epi-PGF2alpha as a means to assess cardiovascular risk in OSA patients."
