    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is investigated as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress in relation to airborne pollutant exposure. While some studies indicate associations between particulate matter (PM2.5) and decreased pulmonary function, the direct relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels and pulmonary function measures is not clearly established. The evidence suggests that while 8-epi-PGF2alpha may reflect oxidative stress, its correlation with pulmonary function remains inconclusive, as some studies did not find significant associations."
