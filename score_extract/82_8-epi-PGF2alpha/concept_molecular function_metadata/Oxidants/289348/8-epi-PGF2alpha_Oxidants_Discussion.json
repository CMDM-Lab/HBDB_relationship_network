    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed as a potential mediator of oxidative stress, particularly in relation to cystic fibrosis. The increased levels of 8-isoprostane in breath condensate indicate lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage, suggesting a direct relationship with oxidants. This highlights the role of 8-isoprostane in the pathophysiology of oxidative stress and its potential as a biomarker for antioxidant treatment efficacy in clinical trials."
