    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed as a marker of oxidative stress, with its concentrations positively correlating with the presence of oxidants in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study suggests that an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants may contribute to cardiovascular complications associated with OSA, indicating a significant relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and oxidants in the context of inflammation and oxidative stress in these patients."
