    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is discussed in relation to exhaled breath condensate (EBC) analysis in children with asthma. The study indicates that 8-isoprostane levels remain unchanged regardless of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker in asthma. However, the relationship is primarily observational, focusing on its presence in exhalation rather than a direct functional interaction."
