    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, which can be measured in exhaled breath condensate. The study aims to compare 8-isoprostane levels in the breath of cystic fibrosis patients versus normal subjects, indicating a direct relationship between the measurement of this biomarker and the method of exhalation for assessing lung oxidative stress."
