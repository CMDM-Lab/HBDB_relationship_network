    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a biomarker for oxidative stress and inflammation. Participants performed tidal breathing to collect EBC, which was then analyzed for 8-isoprostane, a specific type of 8-epi-PGF2alpha. This indicates a direct relationship where exhalation serves as the method for sampling and quantifying 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels in the respiratory system."
