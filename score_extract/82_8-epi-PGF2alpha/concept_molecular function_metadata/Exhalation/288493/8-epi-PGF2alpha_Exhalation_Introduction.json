    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to exhalation through its role as a biomarker of oxidative stress measured in exhaled breath condensate. The study investigates how indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, including 8-isoprostane (a type of isoprostane like 8-epi-PGF2alpha), change in response to diesel exhaust exposure in asthmatic and nonasthmatic individuals. This suggests that exhalation can serve as a noninvasive method to assess lung responses to environmental stressors."
