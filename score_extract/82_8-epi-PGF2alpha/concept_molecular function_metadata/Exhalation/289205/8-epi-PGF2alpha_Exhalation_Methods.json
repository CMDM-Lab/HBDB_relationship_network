    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. The study highlights the collection and quantification of this biomarker in exhalation, indicating its relevance as a potential indicator of oxidative stress or inflammation in respiratory conditions. The method used for measurement ensures high accuracy and specificity for 8-isoprostane, linking it directly to exhalation as a noninvasive diagnostic approach."
