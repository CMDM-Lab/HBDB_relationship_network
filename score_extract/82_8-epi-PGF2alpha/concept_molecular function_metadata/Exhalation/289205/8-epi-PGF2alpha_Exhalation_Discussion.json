    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess airway inflammation following ozone exposure. The study compares the levels of exhaled 8-isoprostane between groups treated with inhaled corticosteroids and a placebo, indicating that exhalation is a method for evaluating the effects of these treatments on inflammatory markers in the respiratory system. However, the relationship is primarily focused on measurement rather than a direct interaction."
