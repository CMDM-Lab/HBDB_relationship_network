    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is measured in the exhaled breath condensate of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study highlights that elevated levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha correlate with oxidative stress in the airways and plasma, suggesting that exhalation analysis of this compound could help identify patients at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases associated with OSA."
