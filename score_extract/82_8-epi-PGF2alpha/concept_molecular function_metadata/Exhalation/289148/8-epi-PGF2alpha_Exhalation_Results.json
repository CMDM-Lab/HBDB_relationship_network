    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically measured as 8-isoprostane, is analyzed in relation to exhalation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study finds a positive correlation between morning levels of exhaled 8-isoprostane and plasma levels, indicating that exhalation can serve as a noninvasive method to assess oxidative stress in OSA patients. However, no significant differences in exhaled levels were found between OSA patients and healthy controls, suggesting that while exhalation is relevant for measuring 8-epi-PGF2alpha, its diagnostic utility may be limited in this context."
