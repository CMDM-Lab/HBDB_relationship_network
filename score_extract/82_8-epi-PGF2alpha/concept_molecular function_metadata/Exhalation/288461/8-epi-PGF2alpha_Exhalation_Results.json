    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is measured in exhaled breath samples of asthmatic patients to assess oxidative stress levels. The study indicates that while obesity is linked to increased exhaled 8-isoprostane levels, asthma itself raises plasma levels without a correlation to exhaled levels. This suggests that exhalation of 8-epi-PGF2alpha may serve as a noninvasive marker for oxidative stress in asthma, but the relationship is complex and influenced by obesity."
