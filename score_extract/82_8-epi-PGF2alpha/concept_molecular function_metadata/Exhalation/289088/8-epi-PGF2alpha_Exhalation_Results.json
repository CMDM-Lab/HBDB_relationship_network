    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (also known as 8-isoprostane) is mentioned in relation to exhalation as a biomarker. The study indicates a positive correlation between exhaled Interleukin-6 and exhaled 8-isoprostane levels in COPD patients, suggesting that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may serve as a relevant indicator of inflammatory processes in exhaled breath. This highlights its potential role in assessing respiratory conditions through breath analysis."
