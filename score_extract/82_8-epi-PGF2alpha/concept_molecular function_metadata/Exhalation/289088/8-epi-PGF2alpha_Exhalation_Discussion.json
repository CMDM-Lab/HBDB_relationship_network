    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is indirectly related to exhalation as it is mentioned alongside exhaled markers like Interleukin-6 in the assessment of inflammation and oxidative stress in COPD patients. The study suggests that exhaled markers can be useful in clinical management, indicating that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may be measured in exhaled breath to evaluate oxidative stress in respiratory diseases, although its specific role in exhalation is not detailed."
