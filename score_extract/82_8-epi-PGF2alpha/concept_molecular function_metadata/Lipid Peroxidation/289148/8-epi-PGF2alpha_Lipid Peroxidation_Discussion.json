    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker for oxidative stress, which is closely linked to lipid peroxidation processes. The measurement of 8-isoprostane levels in biological fluids serves as an indicator of oxidative stress and reflects local lipid peroxidation in the airways, particularly in patients with various pulmonary diseases. This suggests a direct relationship where increased levels of 8-isoprostane indicate heightened lipid peroxidation, emphasizing its role in assessing oxidative damage in respiratory conditions."
