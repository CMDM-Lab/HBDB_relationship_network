    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, with increased levels observed in various respiratory conditions, including Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The study indicates that elevated concentrations of 8-isoprostane are found in exhaled breath condensate of ARDS patients, suggesting a significant relationship between oxidative stress and the severity of respiratory distress. This connection underscores the potential of 8-epi-PGF2alpha as a non-invasive marker for assessing lung oxidative stress in ARDS."
