    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is linked to asthma through its increased levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) following exposure to cigarette smoke. The studies mentioned indicate that both asthmatic and healthy individuals show elevated 8-isoprostane levels after smoke exposure, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for oxidative stress in asthma. However, the relationship is not fully established, as some studies did not find a correlation between 8-isoprostane and particulate matter in asthmatic children."
