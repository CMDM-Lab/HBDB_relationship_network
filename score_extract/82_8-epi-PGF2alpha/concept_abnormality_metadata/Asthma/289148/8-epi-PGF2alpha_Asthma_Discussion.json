    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for oxidative stress, which has been linked to various pulmonary diseases, including asthma. Increased levels of 8-isoprostane have been found in the exhaled breath condensates of asthma patients, indicating its potential role in reflecting local oxidative stress in the airways. This suggests a significant relationship between oxidative stress, as indicated by 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels, and the pathophysiology of asthma."
