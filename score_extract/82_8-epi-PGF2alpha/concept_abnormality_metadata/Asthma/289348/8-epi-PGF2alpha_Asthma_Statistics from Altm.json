    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker for oxidative stress, with increased concentrations found in the exhaled breath condensate of asthma patients. This suggests a significant relationship between elevated levels of 8-epi-PGF2alpha and the pathophysiology of asthma, indicating that oxidative stress may play a role in the disease's progression and severity."
