    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to asthma through its role as a biomarker of oxidative stress, which is measured in exhaled breath condensate. The study investigates how indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, including 8-isoprostane, differ between asthmatic and nonasthmatic individuals, particularly in response to diesel exhaust exposure. While 8-epi-PGF2alpha is not explicitly mentioned, its association with oxidative stress suggests relevance to asthma exacerbations and inflammation."
