    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is linked to asthma through its increased levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with inflammatory airway diseases, including asthma. The study suggests that measuring 8-isoprostane could serve as a noninvasive marker for oxidative stress in asthma, particularly in response to ozone exposure. Additionally, the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on 8-isoprostane levels in asthma patients are explored, indicating a potential relationship between oxidative stress and asthma management."
