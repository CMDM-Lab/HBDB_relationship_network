    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is indirectly related to asthma through the discussion of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection methods. The text mentions that subjects with asthma are more likely to show positive albumin detection in EBC, suggesting a potential link between inflammatory markers like 8-epi-PGF2alpha and asthma. However, the specific role of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in asthma is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of the relationship."
