    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is highlighted as a marker of oxidative stress in children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. The study indicates that increased levels of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) correlate with oxidative stress in asthmatic patients, suggesting its potential role as a noninvasive biomarker for assessing asthma severity and inflammation. This relationship underscores the relevance of oxidative stress in asthma pathology."
