    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, also referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane are elevated in individuals with asthma, suggesting its potential role in the inflammatory processes associated with the disease. The findings imply that measuring 8-isoprostane could provide insights into asthma pathology and severity, particularly as levels vary with age among patients."
