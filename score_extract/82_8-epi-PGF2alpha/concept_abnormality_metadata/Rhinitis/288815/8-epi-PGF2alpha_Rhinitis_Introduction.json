    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha is investigated alongside leukotrienes in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to monitor changes in patients with suspected occupational asthma and/or rhinitis. The study aims to assess the relationship between these biomarkers and allergic responses triggered by workplace allergens, indicating a potential link between 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels and rhinitis symptoms in affected individuals."
