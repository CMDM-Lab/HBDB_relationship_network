    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. Its levels are reported to be increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), indicating a potential link between oxidative stress and the pathophysiology of COPD. The study suggests that measuring 8-epi-PGF2alpha concentrations in biological fluids could provide insights into the oxidative stress present in patients with this disease."
