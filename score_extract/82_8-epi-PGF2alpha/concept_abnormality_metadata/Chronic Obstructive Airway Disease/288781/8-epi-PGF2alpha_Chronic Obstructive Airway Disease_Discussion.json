    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD) among other respiratory diseases. The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane are elevated in patients with COPD, suggesting its potential role in reflecting oxidative stress or inflammation associated with the disease. The findings imply a significant relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels and the presence of COPD, particularly as they vary with age in the studied population."
