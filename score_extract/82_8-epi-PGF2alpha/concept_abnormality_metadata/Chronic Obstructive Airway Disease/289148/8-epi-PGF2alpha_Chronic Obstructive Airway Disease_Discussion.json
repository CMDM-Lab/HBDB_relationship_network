    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for oxidative stress, which is relevant in various pulmonary diseases, including Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease (COPD). Increased levels of 8-isoprostane have been observed in the urine of COPD patients, indicating its potential role in reflecting oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the disease's pathophysiology. This suggests a significant relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and COPD, as it may serve as a useful marker for monitoring oxidative stress in affected individuals."
