    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is linked to cardiovascular diseases through its elevated levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study suggests that increased oxidative stress, indicated by 8-isoprostane levels, may contribute to the heightened risk of cardiovascular diseases in these patients. Monitoring 8-epi-PGF2alpha could help identify individuals at greater risk for cardiovascular complications associated with OSA."
