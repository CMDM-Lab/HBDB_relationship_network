    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in various lung diseases, including interstitial lung diseases and cystic fibrosis. The study highlights the increased levels of 8-isoprostane in patients with these conditions, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for oxidative stress and inflammation in lung pathology. However, the specific relationship between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and interstitial lung diseases is not deeply explored beyond its mention as a relevant isoprostane in the context of oxidative stress."
