    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for oxidative stress, which has been linked to various lung diseases, including interstitial lung disease. Increased levels of 8-isoprostane have been observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with interstitial lung disease, indicating its potential role in monitoring oxidative stress and related pathophysiological changes in the lungs."
