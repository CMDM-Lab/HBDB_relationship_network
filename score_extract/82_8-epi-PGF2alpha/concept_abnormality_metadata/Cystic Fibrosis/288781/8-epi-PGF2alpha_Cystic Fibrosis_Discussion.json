    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with cystic fibrosis, among other respiratory diseases. The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane are significantly increased in cystic fibrosis patients, suggesting its potential role in monitoring inflammation or oxidative stress associated with the disease. The findings also note variations in 8-isoprostane levels across different age groups, indicating its relevance in the disease's progression."
