    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is highlighted as a reliable biomarker for oxidative stress, which has been shown to be elevated in patients with cystic fibrosis. The measurement of 8-isoprostane levels in biological fluids, including plasma, is associated with systemic oxidative stress, indicating its potential role in monitoring the oxidative stress-related pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. This suggests a significant relationship between oxidative stress, as indicated by 8-epi-PGF2alpha levels, and the disease state in cystic fibrosis patients."
