    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, also referred to as 8-isoprostane, is implicated in the oxidative stress associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). The study indicates that increased levels of 8-isoprostane in breath condensate reflect heightened lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage in CF patients. This suggests a potential role for 8-isoprostane as a biomarker for oxidative stress and a target for antioxidant therapies in CF management."
