    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a type of isoprostane, is significantly elevated in the breath condensate of patients with stable cystic fibrosis compared to normal subjects. This increase suggests a link between oxidative stress and inflammation in cystic fibrosis, indicating that 8-epi-PGF2alpha may serve as a potential biomarker for disease severity and airway inflammation in these patients."
