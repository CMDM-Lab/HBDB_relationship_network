    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referenced as 8-isoprostane, is correlated with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients. The study indicates a significant negative correlation between 8-isoprostane levels in breath condensate and forced expiratory volume (FEV1), suggesting that higher oxidative stress, indicated by increased 8-isoprostane, may be associated with poorer lung function in cystic fibrosis. Additionally, a positive correlation with carbon monoxide levels further emphasizes the role of oxidative stress in this disease."
