    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is positively correlated with oxidative stress in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study indicates that elevated levels of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate and plasma are associated with inflammation and potential cardiovascular complications linked to OSA. This suggests that measuring 8-isoprostane could be useful for screening and monitoring OSA progression, highlighting its relevance in understanding the oxidative stress mechanisms involved in this syndrome."
