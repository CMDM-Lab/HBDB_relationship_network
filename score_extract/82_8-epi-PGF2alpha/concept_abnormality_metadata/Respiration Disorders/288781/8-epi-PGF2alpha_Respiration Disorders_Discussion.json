    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, specifically referred to as 8-isoprostane, is highlighted as a biomarker found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with various respiratory disorders, including asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. The study indicates that levels of 8-isoprostane are significantly elevated in these conditions, suggesting its potential role in the pathophysiology of respiratory diseases and its utility as a noninvasive marker for assessing respiratory health."
