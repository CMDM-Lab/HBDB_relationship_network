    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha (8-isoprostane) is linked to obesity through its correlation with neck circumference in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The study suggests that elevated levels of this oxidative stress marker in exhaled breath may indicate a higher risk of developing OSA in obese individuals. This relationship highlights the potential role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of obesity-related complications."
