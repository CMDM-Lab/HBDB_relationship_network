    "summary": "In this context, 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of oxidative stress, is linked to childhood asthma through its increased concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of children with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. The study suggests that elevated levels of this eicosanoid may indicate oxidative stress in asthmatic children, supporting the potential for antioxidants in treatment. Thus, 8-epi-PGF2alpha serves as a noninvasive biomarker for assessing oxidative stress in childhood asthma."
