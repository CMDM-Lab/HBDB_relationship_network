    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can induce oxidative stress, particularly in the study of dermal toxicity. However, there is no direct mention or exploration of Roger's disease in relation to 1,3-xylene. The focus is primarily on the chemical's irritant properties and its effects on rat dermal fibroblasts, without establishing a clear connection to Roger's disease."
