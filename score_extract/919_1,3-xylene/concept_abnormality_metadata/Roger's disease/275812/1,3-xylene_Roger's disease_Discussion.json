    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is discussed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can induce cytotoxicity and skin irritation, potentially leading to oxidative stress and DNA damage. However, there is no direct mention of Roger's disease or any specific relationship between 1,3-xylene and this disease. The focus is primarily on the effects of m-xylene on cellular antioxidants and skin irritation, without establishing a connection to Roger's disease."
