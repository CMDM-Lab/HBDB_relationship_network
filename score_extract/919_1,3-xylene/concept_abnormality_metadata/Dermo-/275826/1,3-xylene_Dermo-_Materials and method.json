    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is evaluated for its effects on dermal equivalents, specifically assessing cell viability after exposure. The study calculates the concentration of m-xylene in fibroblasts within these dermal equivalents, indicating a direct relationship between the chemical exposure and the biological response of the dermal cells. The analysis aims to understand how 1,3-xylene impacts cell viability in a controlled environment, highlighting its relevance in dermal toxicity studies."
