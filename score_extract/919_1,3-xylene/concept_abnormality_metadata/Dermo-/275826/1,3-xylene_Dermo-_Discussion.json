    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is discussed in relation to its exposure and distribution in dermal equivalents during toxicology assessments. The focus is on how m-xylene, a related compound, interacts with skin and tissue culture media, emphasizing the importance of partition coefficients in understanding chemical concentrations in fibroblasts. However, the term 'Dermo-' is not explicitly defined or connected to 1,3-xylene beyond its implication in dermal exposure, leading to a lack of direct relationship."
