    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a volatile chemical used in dermal equivalent toxicity assessments. The study compares the viability of dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene in different exposure systems. However, there is no direct relationship established between 1,3-xylene and the term 'Dermo-', which appears to refer to dermal equivalents without further elaboration on their interaction or significance."
