    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is linked to dermal effects through its cytotoxicity in fibroblasts, where it induces a decrease in cellular antioxidants like thiols and catalase. The study suggests that oxidative stress may contribute to the cytotoxic effects of 1,3-xylene on dermal cells, indicating a potential relationship between the chemical and dermal health. However, the term 'Dermo-' is not explicitly defined or elaborated upon in the context, limiting the depth of the relationship."
