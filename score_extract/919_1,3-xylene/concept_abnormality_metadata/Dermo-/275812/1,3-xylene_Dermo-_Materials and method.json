    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to dermal equivalents, which are used to study the cytotoxic effects of m-xylene exposure. The study investigates whether antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or catalase can protect these dermal equivalents from the cytotoxicity induced by m-xylene. While 1,3-xylene is part of the broader category of xylene compounds, the specific relationship to dermal equivalents is indirect, focusing more on the effects of m-xylene rather than a direct interaction with 1,3-xylene itself."
