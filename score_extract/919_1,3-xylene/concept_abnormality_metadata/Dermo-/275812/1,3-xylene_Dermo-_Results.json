    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to its cytotoxic effects on cells, while 'Dermo-' likely refers to dermal exposure or dermal equivalents used in the study. The study assesses the viability of cells exposed to various conditions, including m-xylene and catalase treatment, but does not provide a direct relationship between 1,3-xylene and dermal exposure. The focus is more on the effects of xylene on cell viability rather than a specific interaction with dermal exposure methods."
