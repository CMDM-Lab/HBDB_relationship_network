    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is implicated in inducing cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in fibroblasts, leading to a decrease in cellular antioxidants, specifically sulfhydryl compounds (thiols). The study indicates that exposure to 1,3-xylene results in a significant reduction of these antioxidants, suggesting a direct relationship where the presence of 1,3-xylene contributes to the depletion of sulfhydryl compounds due to oxidative damage."
