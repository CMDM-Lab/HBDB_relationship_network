    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is linked to the observed decrease in sulfhydryl compounds, specifically DTNB-reactive thiol levels, following exposure. The study indicates that exposure to m-xylene leads to a dose-dependent reduction in thiol levels, which are important for maintaining cellular redox balance and enzymatic activity, including catalase. This suggests a potential oxidative stress response associated with 1,3-xylene exposure, impacting sulfhydryl compound levels."
