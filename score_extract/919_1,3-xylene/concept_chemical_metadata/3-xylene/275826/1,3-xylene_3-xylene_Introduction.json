    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to a study on chemical exposure in cultured cells. However, the text does not provide specific details about their individual properties, interactions, or comparative significance. They are part of a broader discussion on the relationship between chemical concentrations and biological responses, but no direct relationship between the two xylene isomers is established."
