    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to the study of dermal equivalent viability under chemical exposure. However, the text primarily focuses on m-xylene and its effects on cell viability, with no direct comparison or interaction between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene discussed. Their relationship is implied through their classification as xylene isomers, but no specific functional or experimental connection is established."
