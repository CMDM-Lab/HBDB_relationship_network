    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as isomers of xylene, but there is no direct discussion of their specific relationship or interactions. The focus is primarily on m-xylene concentrations and their effects in experimental setups, without elaborating on the differences or similarities between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene. Thus, they appear in the same context but without a clear connection."
