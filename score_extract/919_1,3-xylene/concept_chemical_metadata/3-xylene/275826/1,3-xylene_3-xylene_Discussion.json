    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene, but the text primarily discusses m-xylene (meta-xylene) and its partition coefficients in biological systems. While 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are mentioned as related compounds, the focus is on m-xylene's behavior in fibroblasts and collagen, without a direct comparison or interaction between the two isomers. Thus, their relationship is implied through their classification as xylenes but lacks specific details."
