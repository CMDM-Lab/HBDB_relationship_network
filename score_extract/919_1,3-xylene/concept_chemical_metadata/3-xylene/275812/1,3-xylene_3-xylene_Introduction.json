    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) related to the study of dermal toxicity and oxidative stress. However, the specific relationship between these two is not elaborated upon, as the focus is primarily on m-xylene's effects. The mention of xylene as an irritant suggests a general category of compounds rather than a direct interaction or comparison between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene."
