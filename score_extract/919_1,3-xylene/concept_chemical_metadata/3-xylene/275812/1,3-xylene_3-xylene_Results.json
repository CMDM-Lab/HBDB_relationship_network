    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both mentioned in relation to their effects on cell viability during exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the specific relationship between these two is not detailed, as the focus is primarily on m-xylene and the effects of pretreatment with catalase and NAC on cell viability. The mention of 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene does not indicate a direct interaction or comparison between them."
