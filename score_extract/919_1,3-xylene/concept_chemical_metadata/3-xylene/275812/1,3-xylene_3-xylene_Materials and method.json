    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene mentioned in relation to m-xylene exposure and its cytotoxic effects on dermal equivalents. However, the context primarily focuses on m-xylene and the protective effects of antioxidants against its toxicity, without detailing any specific interactions or comparisons between 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene. Their mention is more about their classification as xylene isomers rather than a direct relationship."
