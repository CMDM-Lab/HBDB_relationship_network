    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and 3-xylene are both isomers of xylene, but the focus is primarily on m-xylene (which is 1,2-xylene) and its cytotoxic effects on rat dermal fibroblasts. The study discusses the oxidative stress induced by m-xylene, suggesting that while 1,3-xylene is mentioned, its specific relationship to the observed effects of m-xylene is not directly explored. The mention of both compounds indicates they belong to the same chemical family, but their individual roles in the context are not elaborated upon."
