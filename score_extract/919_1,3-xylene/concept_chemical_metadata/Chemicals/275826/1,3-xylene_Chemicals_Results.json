    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a specific chemical being tested for its effects on dermal equivalents in a study assessing cell viability. The study compares the impact of chemical evaporation from exposure mediums containing m-xylene, which is a related compound, indicating that 1,3-xylene is part of a broader category of chemicals being evaluated for their biological effects. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its classification as a chemical under investigation."
