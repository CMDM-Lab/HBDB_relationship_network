    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a specific volatile organic compound (VOC) within a broader discussion about chemicals used in a system designed to maintain constant chemical doses for in vitro exposure studies. The focus is on understanding the relationship between chemical concentrations and biological responses, indicating that 1,3-xylene is part of the larger category of chemicals being studied for their effects on cultured cells. However, there is no detailed exploration of its specific properties or interactions beyond its classification as a chemical."
