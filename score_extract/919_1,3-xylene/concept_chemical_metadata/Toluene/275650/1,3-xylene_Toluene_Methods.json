    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and toluene are both mentioned as components of the BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene) standards used in a gas analysis procedure. They are part of a calibration process involving sorbent tubes and carrier gas, indicating they are analyzed together in the same experimental setup. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their inclusion in the BTX standard mixture."
