    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and toluene are both mentioned as target analytes in the evaluation of permeation rates using PT devices. They are part of a group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that include benzene, toluene, and m-xylene (BTX). However, the context does not provide any specific interaction or functional relationship between 1,3-xylene and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same study, indicating they are both being assessed for their permeation characteristics without further elaboration on their chemical or biological interactions."
