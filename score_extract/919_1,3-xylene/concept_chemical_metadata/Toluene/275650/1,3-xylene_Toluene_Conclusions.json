    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene and toluene are both mentioned as model compounds (BTX) whose permeation rates are being evaluated under varying conditions. The study highlights the need for empirical equations to predict permeation rates more accurately for these compounds, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of volatile organic compounds. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between 1,3-xylene and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same category of compounds being studied."
