    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as a compound whose concentration was measured during an experiment involving dermal equivalents, while bromides are not directly referenced in terms of their relationship to 1,3-xylene. The focus is primarily on the effects of m-xylene on cell viability, with no discussion of bromides or their potential interactions with xylene. Thus, there is no clear connection established between the two terms."
