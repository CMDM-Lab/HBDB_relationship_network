    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned as part of a group of target analytes (benzene, toluene, and m-xylene) evaluated for their permeation rates using PT devices. However, the relationship between 1,3-xylene and the term 'analyte' is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on the performance of the PT devices rather than on the specific interactions or characteristics of 1,3-xylene as an analyte. The mention is more about its inclusion in a broader study rather than a direct relationship."
