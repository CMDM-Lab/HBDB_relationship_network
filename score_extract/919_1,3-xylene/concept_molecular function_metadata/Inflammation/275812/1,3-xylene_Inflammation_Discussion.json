    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can induce skin irritation and inflammation upon exposure. The study highlights that m-xylene exposure leads to cytotoxicity and a decrease in cellular antioxidants, suggesting that oxidative stress and free radical formation contribute to the inflammatory response. The relationship is significant as it connects the irritant properties of m-xylene with the biological effects of inflammation and oxidative damage."
