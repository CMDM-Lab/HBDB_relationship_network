    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is analyzed for its concentration in fibroblasts, while catalase activity is assessed as part of the evaluation of cellular responses to exposure. Although both terms are mentioned in relation to the effects of m-xylene exposure on fibroblast viability and cellular function, there is no direct discussion of how 1,3-xylene specifically influences catalase activity or any mechanistic relationship between them."
