    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene exposure is linked to a decrease in catalase activity in dermal fibroblasts. The study indicates that exposure to m-xylene results in a time- and dose-dependent reduction in cellular viability and endogenous antioxidants, including catalase. While catalase pretreatment showed a marginal increase in cell viability, it was not statistically significant, suggesting that the relationship between 1,3-xylene and catalase activity is relevant but not strongly impactful in terms of protective effects against oxidative stress."
