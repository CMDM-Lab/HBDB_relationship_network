    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene exposure is linked to a decrease in catalase activity in fibroblasts within dermal equivalents. The study shows that as the concentration of m-xylene increases, catalase activity declines in a time- and dose-dependent manner, indicating a potential toxic effect of 1,3-xylene on cellular antioxidant defenses. This suggests that 1,3-xylene may impair the ability of fibroblasts to manage oxidative stress, as evidenced by the significant reduction in catalase activity observed at both 1 and 4 hours post-exposure."
