    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is indirectly related to cell survival through its impact on fibroblast viability. The study demonstrates that exposure to m-xylene, a structural isomer of 1,3-xylene, decreases cell viability in fibroblasts with increasing concentration. The EC50 value indicates the concentration at which cell survival is significantly affected, suggesting a toxicological relationship between xylene exposure and cell survival outcomes."
