    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is examined for its effects on cell survival, specifically in dermal equivalents exposed to m-xylene. The viability of these cells is assessed using the MTT assay, which measures mitochondrial activity as an indicator of cell health. The study focuses on how exposure to m-xylene impacts cell survival over a defined time period, suggesting a direct relationship between the chemical exposure and cellular viability."
