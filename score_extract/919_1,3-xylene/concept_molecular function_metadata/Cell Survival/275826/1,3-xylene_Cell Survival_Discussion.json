    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is indirectly related to cell survival through its impact on fibroblast viability during exposure experiments. The study compares cell viability in unsealed versus sealed environments, highlighting that m-xylene evaporation in unsealed plates leads to higher fibroblast survival rates. This suggests that the concentration of 1,3-xylene affects cell survival, but the relationship is primarily inferred from the effects of m-xylene rather than a direct analysis of 1,3-xylene's specific impact."
