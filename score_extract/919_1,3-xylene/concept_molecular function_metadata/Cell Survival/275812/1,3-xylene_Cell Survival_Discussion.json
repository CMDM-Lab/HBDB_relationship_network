    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene exposure is linked to decreased cell survival in dermal fibroblasts, as indicated by a time- and dose-dependent reduction in catalase activity, which is an antioxidant enzyme. The study suggests that while the addition of catalase may provide some marginal protection against cytotoxicity induced by 1,3-xylene, it does not significantly improve cell viability over time. This indicates a detrimental effect of 1,3-xylene on cell survival, likely through mechanisms involving oxidative stress."
