    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is evaluated for its effects on cell survival, specifically in fibroblast cultures. The study measures cell viability in response to varying concentrations of 1,3-xylene, determining the EC50 value, which indicates the concentration at which 50% of the cells survive. This suggests a direct relationship between 1,3-xylene exposure and cell survival outcomes, highlighting its potential cytotoxic effects."
