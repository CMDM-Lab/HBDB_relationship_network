    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is evaluated for its impact on cell survival in an in vitro study. The viability of cells exposed to 1,3-xylene is indirectly assessed through comparisons with m-xylene exposures and the effects of pretreatment with catalase and NAC. The study indicates that pretreatment can enhance cell viability, suggesting that 1,3-xylene exposure may influence cell survival, although the specific effects of 1,3-xylene alone are not detailed."
