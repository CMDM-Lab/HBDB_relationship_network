    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is mentioned in relation to its cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts, particularly in the context of oxidative stress and skin irritation. However, the term 'Synthesis' does not have a direct connection to 1,3-xylene within the provided text. The focus is on the protective effects of NAC against m-xylene-induced cytotoxicity rather than any synthesis process involving 1,3-xylene."
