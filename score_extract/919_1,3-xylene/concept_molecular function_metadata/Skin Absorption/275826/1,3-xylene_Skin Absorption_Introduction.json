    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-xylene is discussed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that, like m-xylene, can induce skin inflammation and is absorbed through the skin. The study highlights the effects of xylene exposure, including increased blood and tissue concentrations, leading to inflammatory responses such as plasma extravasation and leukocyte infiltration. This suggests a direct relationship between 1,3-xylene and skin absorption, emphasizing the compound's potential irritancy and toxicity upon dermal exposure."
