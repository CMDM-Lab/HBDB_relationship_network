    "summary": "In this context, chromium and zeolites are closely related through the process of biosorption and catalysis. The Cr-NaY zeolite, formed after the biosorption of Cr(VI), acts as a catalyst for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like ethyl acetate, ethanol, and toluene. The presence of chromium enhances the catalytic activity and selectivity towards CO2 production, demonstrating a significant interaction between chromium and zeolites in environmental applications, particularly in treating chromium-contaminated wastewater while removing VOCs from gaseous streams."
