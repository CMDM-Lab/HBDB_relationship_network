    "summary": "In this context, chromium and zeolites are closely related through their application in environmental remediation. The study highlights the use of zeolites, specifically NaY zeolite, for the biosorption of hexavalent chromium from contaminated water. After biosorption, the chromium-loaded zeolite is utilized as a catalyst for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, demonstrating a dual benefit of chromium reuse and zeolite functionality in pollution control. This relationship underscores the potential of zeolites in enhancing the environmental management of chromium pollutants."
