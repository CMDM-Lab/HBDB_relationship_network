    "summary": "In this context, chromium is incorporated into the zeolite structure (specifically Cr-NaY zeolite) to enhance its catalytic performance in the oxidation of toluene. The presence of chromium significantly improves the conversion rates of toluene to CO2, achieving a maximum conversion of 70% at 450Â°C, compared to the starting NaY zeolite, which shows minimal conversion. This indicates a strong functional relationship where chromium modifies the zeolite's properties to facilitate better catalytic activity for volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation."
