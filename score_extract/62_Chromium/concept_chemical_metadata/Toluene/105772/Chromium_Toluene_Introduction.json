    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its use as a catalyst for the oxidation of toluene and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) after being biosorbed onto zeolite. The study highlights the dual environmental benefit of reusing chromium, a xenobiotic pollutant, in the catalytic oxidation process, indicating a significant functional relationship between chromium and toluene in environmental remediation efforts."
