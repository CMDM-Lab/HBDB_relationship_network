    "summary": "In this context, chromium is evaluated for its role in enhancing the catalytic performance of Cr-NaY zeolite in the oxidation of toluene. The presence of chromium significantly improves the conversion efficiency of toluene to CO2, achieving a maximum conversion of 70% at 450Â°C, compared to negligible conversion with the NaY zeolite alone. This indicates a strong catalytic relationship where chromium acts as a crucial component in facilitating the oxidation of toluene."
