    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its two oxidation states, Cr(III) and Cr(VI), which are classified as chromium compounds. The study aims to measure these chromium species in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples from both occupationally exposed individuals and a control group. The focus is on detecting differences in chromium levels between these groups, highlighting the relevance of chromium compounds in occupational health monitoring."
