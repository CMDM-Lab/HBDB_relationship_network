    "summary": "In this context, chromium refers to the element that exists in various oxidation states, including hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), which encompasses chromates. Chromates are specific compounds derived from chromium that are known to be toxic and carcinogenic. The text discusses the health risks associated with Cr(VI) exposure, particularly in occupational settings, and contrasts it with the non-toxic nature of trivalent chromium (Cr(III)), highlighting the significant difference in toxicity between these two forms of chromium."
