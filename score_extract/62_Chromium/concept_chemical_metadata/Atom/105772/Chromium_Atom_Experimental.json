    "summary": "In this context, chromium is mentioned as an element being quantified through various analytical techniques, including spectroscopic methods and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The term 'atom' is implied as chromium is a chemical element, which consists of atoms. However, there is no detailed discussion of their relationship beyond this basic definition of chromium as an atom."
