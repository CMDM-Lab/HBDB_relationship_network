    "summary": "In this context, chromium is identified as a specific metal present in the zeolite samples, with its concentration measured before and after calcination. The analysis indicates that chromium is uniformly distributed on the zeolite surface, highlighting its role as a metal in the composition of the material. The study focuses on the properties and distribution of chromium within the broader category of metals, particularly in relation to zeolite catalysts."
