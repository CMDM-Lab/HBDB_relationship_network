    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its levels in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, with a focus on different exposure routes including dermal absorption. The analysis indicates that urinary chromium levels reflect multiple exposure routes, including dermal, while EBC primarily reflects inhalation exposure. However, the specific relationship between chromium and dermal exposure is not quantitatively detailed, leading to a general understanding of chromium's presence in various exposure contexts without a strong emphasis on dermal absorption's impact."
