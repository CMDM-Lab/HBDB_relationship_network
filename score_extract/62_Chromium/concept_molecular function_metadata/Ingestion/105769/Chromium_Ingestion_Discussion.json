    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its presence in biological samples, specifically urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The analysis indicates that urinary chromium levels reflect multiple exposure routes, including ingestion. However, the study primarily focuses on inhalation exposure, suggesting that while ingestion is a potential route, it is not the main focus of the analysis. The lack of correlation between chromium levels in urine and EBC samples implies that ingestion may not significantly impact the measured levels in this specific study."
