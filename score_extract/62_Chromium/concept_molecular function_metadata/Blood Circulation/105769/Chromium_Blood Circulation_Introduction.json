    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its inhalation exposure and subsequent excretion processes, particularly focusing on how chromium, especially in its hexavalent form, is absorbed into the bloodstream after being inhaled. The relationship to blood circulation is highlighted by the fact that a significant portion of respirable chromium is cleared from the lungs into the bloodstream, indicating its potential impact on blood circulation and systemic exposure. However, the specific effects of chromium on blood circulation are not detailed in the provided context."
