    "summary": "In this context, chromium plays a crucial role in the oxidation of toluene when used in Cr-NaY zeolite as a catalyst. The presence of chromium significantly enhances the catalytic performance, achieving a maximum CO2 conversion of 70% at 450Â°C, compared to negligible conversion with the NaY zeolite alone. This indicates that chromium is essential for effective oxidation processes in this reaction."
