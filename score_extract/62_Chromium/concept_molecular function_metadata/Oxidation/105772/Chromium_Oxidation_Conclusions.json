    "summary": "In this context, chromium is involved in the oxidation process of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when used as a catalyst in zeolite. The study highlights that chromium, initially present as Cr(III), undergoes oxidation to Cr(VI) upon calcination, enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2 production during the oxidation of VOCs like ethyl acetate, ethanol, and toluene. This indicates a significant role of chromium in facilitating oxidation reactions."
