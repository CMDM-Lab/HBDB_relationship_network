    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its presence in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, indicating potential exposure routes including inhalation and dermal absorption. However, the study primarily focuses on the correlation between chromium levels in urine and EBC, without directly addressing skin absorption as a significant factor. The lack of correlation between urinary chromium and EBC suggests that skin absorption may not be a primary route of exposure in this study, although it is acknowledged as one of the potential exposure pathways."
