    "summary": "In this context, chromium, specifically hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), is highlighted as a chemical that can be absorbed through the skin, leading to various health risks including skin irritation and allergic dermatitis. The text discusses the pathways of exposure to Cr(VI), emphasizing dermal absorption as a significant route alongside inhalation and ingestion. This underscores the importance of understanding skin absorption in the context of occupational exposure to chromium compounds, which are classified as carcinogens and sensitizers."
