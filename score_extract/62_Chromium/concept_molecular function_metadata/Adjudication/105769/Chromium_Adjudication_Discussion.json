    "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is discussed in relation to its levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) among different worker cohorts, particularly focusing on Cr(VI) exposure. The term 'adjudication' is indirectly referenced in the context of needing a standard marker for EBC samples to account for dilution effects, which is crucial for accurately assessing chromium exposure. However, there is no direct relationship established between chromium and adjudication, as adjudication pertains more to the need for standardization in measurement rather than a specific interaction with chromium itself."
