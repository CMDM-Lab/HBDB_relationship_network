    "summary": "In this context, chromium is utilized as a component of a zeolite catalyst after being biosorbed from contaminated water. The study highlights the dual role of chromium, where it is first removed as a pollutant and then repurposed as a catalyst for the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. This demonstrates a significant relationship between chromium and its application as a catalyst, emphasizing its environmental benefits in both remediation and catalysis."
