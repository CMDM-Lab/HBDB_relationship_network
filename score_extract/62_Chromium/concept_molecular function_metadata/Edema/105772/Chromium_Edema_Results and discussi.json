    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its reduction from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by bacteria and its subsequent biosorption onto zeolites. However, there is no mention of edema or any direct relationship between chromium and edema. The focus is primarily on chromium's chemical behavior and its removal efficiencies at different pH levels, with no implications for edema or related physiological effects."
