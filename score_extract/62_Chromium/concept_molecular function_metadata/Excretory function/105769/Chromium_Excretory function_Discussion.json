    "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is discussed in relation to its excretion rates in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) among workers exposed to Cr(VI). The study highlights the need for understanding chromium's half-life and excretion patterns, indicating that chromium exposure can affect excretory function, particularly in workers with direct and indirect exposure. The increase in chromium levels in EBC suggests a link between chromium exposure and its excretory dynamics, emphasizing the importance of monitoring for potential health impacts."
