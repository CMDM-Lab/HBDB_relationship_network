    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its excretion through urine as a biomarker for exposure assessment, particularly for Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The urinary chromium levels reflect both past and recent exposure, indicating that the excretory function plays a crucial role in eliminating chromium from the body. The text outlines the processes involved in chromium excretion, including the stages of elimination and the impact of inhalation exposure on urinary chromium levels, highlighting the significance of excretory function in monitoring chromium exposure."
