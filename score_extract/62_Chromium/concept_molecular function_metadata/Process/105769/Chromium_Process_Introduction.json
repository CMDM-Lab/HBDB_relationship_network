    "summary": "In this context, chromium is discussed in relation to its detection and excretion processes following exposure, particularly focusing on Cr(III) and Cr(VI). The urinary excretion of chromium is described as a multi-stage process influenced by inhalation exposure, highlighting the biological monitoring of chromium levels as a method to assess occupational exposure. This indicates a significant relationship between chromium and the processes involved in its biological monitoring and elimination from the body."
