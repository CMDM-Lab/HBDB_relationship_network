    "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is discussed in relation to its exposure levels among workers involved in chromium processing. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive protocol to assess chromium levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to understand exposure dynamics. The relationship indicates that chromium processing activities contribute to inhalation exposure, affecting both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) levels in workers, thus linking chromium to occupational health processes."
