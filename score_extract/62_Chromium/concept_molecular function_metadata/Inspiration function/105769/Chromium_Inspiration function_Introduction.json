    "summary": "In this context, chromium (Cr) is investigated in relation to its presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples from workers potentially exposed to chromium compounds through inhalation. The study aims to measure levels of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) to assess any differences between occupationally exposed individuals and a control group. While chromium exposure may impact respiratory health, the specific relationship to inspiration function is not directly addressed in the context provided."
