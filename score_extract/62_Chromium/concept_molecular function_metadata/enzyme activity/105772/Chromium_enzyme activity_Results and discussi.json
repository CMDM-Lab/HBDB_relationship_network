    "summary": "In this context, chromium is evaluated for its role in enhancing the catalytic activity of Cr-NaY zeolite during the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like ethyl acetate, ethanol, and toluene. The study assesses how chromium affects the enzyme-like activity of the catalyst, particularly under varying pH conditions. The results indicate that chromium significantly influences the catalytic performance, suggesting a direct relationship between chromium presence and enzyme activity in the context of VOC oxidation reactions."
