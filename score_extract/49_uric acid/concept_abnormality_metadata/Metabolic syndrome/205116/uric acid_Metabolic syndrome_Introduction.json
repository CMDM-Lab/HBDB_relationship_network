    "summary": "In this context, uric acid is discussed in relation to its dual role in health. While chronic hyperuricemia is identified as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular diseases, acute increases in uric acid levels may confer protective effects, such as enhancing antioxidant capacity and improving endothelial function. This highlights a complex relationship where uric acid can be both a risk factor and a potential therapeutic agent, depending on its concentration and context."
