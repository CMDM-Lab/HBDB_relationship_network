    "summary": "In this context, uric acid is associated with primary pulmonary hypertension (PH) as abnormal levels of uric acid in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients correlate with the presence of PH and increased mortality. The study indicates that higher uric acid levels may reflect underlying metabolic disturbances related to PH, particularly in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), suggesting a significant relationship between uric acid levels and the severity of pulmonary hypertension."
