    "summary": "In this context, uric acid is mentioned as a biomarker that may be elevated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which can occur in individuals with scleroderma. While the study focuses on the diagnostic value of various biomarkers in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients, the connection between elevated uric acid levels and scleroderma is implied through its association with PAH. However, there is no direct discussion of uric acid's role specifically in scleroderma itself."
