    "summary": "In this context, uric acid is discussed in relation to pulmonary hypertension (PH) in interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients, where abnormally high levels of uric acid may indicate increased suspicion of PH. Chronic hyperuricemia is noted as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, while acute increases in uric acid can have beneficial effects, such as enhancing antioxidant capacity and restoring endothelial function. This dual role highlights the complex relationship between uric acid levels and hypertensive disease."
