    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole and Carbon Black are both components of crumb rubber material (CRM) derived from recycled tires. Carbon Black serves as a reinforcing agent in the rubber composition, while 1,3-Benzothiazole is mentioned as a vulcanization additive. Their relationship is primarily as constituents of the same material, contributing to the properties of CRM used in artificial turf installations. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific roles beyond their inclusion in the rubber formulation."
