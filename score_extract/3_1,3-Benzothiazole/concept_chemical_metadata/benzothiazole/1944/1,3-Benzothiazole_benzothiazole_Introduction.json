    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole and benzothiazole are both mentioned as chemical compounds derived from tire wear particles, which are detected in environmental samples. While benzothiazole is noted as a ubiquitous compound in the environment, 1,3-Benzothiazole is not specifically discussed in terms of its relationship to benzothiazole or its environmental impact. The mention of both compounds suggests a general connection through their origin from tire materials, but no direct interaction or comparative analysis is provided."
