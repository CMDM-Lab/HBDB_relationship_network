    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole and toluene are both mentioned as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in air samples from a facility. While they are categorized together as air contaminants and industrial solvents, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their presence in the same analytical study. The mention of both compounds highlights their relevance as environmental pollutants but does not establish a significant connection between them."
