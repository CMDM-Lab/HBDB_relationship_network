    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole (BT) and benzothiazole-2-sulfonic acid (BTSA) are mentioned as part of a discussion on leachable benzothiazole derivatives in environmental samples. While BT levels were quantified, BTSA is noted as a major derivative detected at similar or higher levels. This suggests a potential relationship in terms of environmental impact and chemical behavior, but no direct interaction or transformation between the two compounds is explicitly described."
