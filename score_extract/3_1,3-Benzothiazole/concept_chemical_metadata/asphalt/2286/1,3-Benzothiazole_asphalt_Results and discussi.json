    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-Benzothiazole is identified as a significant air contaminant released during the tire curing process, which involves asphalt. The chemical is linked to the production of asphalt fumes during highway paving, indicating a direct relationship where benzothiazole is a byproduct of asphalt-related activities. This suggests that 1,3-Benzothiazole is relevant in the context of environmental pollution associated with asphalt use."
