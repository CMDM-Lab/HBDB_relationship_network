    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to air quality monitoring near industrial sites, with specific reference to its ambient air concentrations. The text indicates that these concentrations are well below health-based and vegetation-based ambient monitoring comparison values (AMCVs). While there is an implication that buta-1,3-diene could affect vegetation, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and the focus is primarily on air quality and health standards rather than direct impacts on vegetation."
