    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to species differences in its toxicity, particularly between mice and rats. The research highlights that the observed variability in tumor induction at different exposure levels may be attributed to differences in the metabolism of BD and its metabolites, such as epoxybutene and diepoxybutane. The development of physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models aims to elucidate these species differences, suggesting that the metabolic response to BD is crucial for understanding its carcinogenic potential across different species."
