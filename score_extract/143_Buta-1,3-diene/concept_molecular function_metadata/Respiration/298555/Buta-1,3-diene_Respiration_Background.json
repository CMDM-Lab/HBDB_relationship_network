    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is linked to respiration through its uptake in the lungs, which is influenced by factors such as alveolar ventilation and the blood-air partition coefficient. The study highlights how individual characteristics, including sex and age, affect the uptake of buta-1,3-diene during respiration, indicating a significant relationship between the inhalation of this compound and respiratory physiology."
