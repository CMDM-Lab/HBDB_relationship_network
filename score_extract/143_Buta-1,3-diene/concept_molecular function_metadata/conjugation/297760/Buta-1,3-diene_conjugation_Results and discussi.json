    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is related to the process of conjugation through its metabolites, specifically DHBMA and MHBMA. DHBMA is formed via hydrolysis of butadiene monoepoxide (BMO), which is then conjugated with glutathione (GSH). This indicates that conjugation is a key metabolic pathway for buta-1,3-diene, facilitating its detoxification and elimination from the body. The context highlights the importance of conjugation in the metabolism of buta-1,3-diene and its derivatives."
