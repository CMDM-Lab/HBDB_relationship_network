    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to its detection using TDL spectroscopy, which also measures the peak-to-peak noise of the instrument response during smoking. The noise levels for buta-1,3-diene are specified, indicating that while the detection of this compound is being assessed, the noise is a factor in the measurement process. However, there is no direct biological or chemical relationship established between buta-1,3-diene and noise beyond the technical aspects of measurement."
