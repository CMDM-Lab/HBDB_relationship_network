    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is discussed in relation to its behavior under laser-generated electromagnetic radiation during the process of strong field ionization (SFI). The text highlights how buta-1,3-diene, as a polyatomic molecule, undergoes fragmentation when subjected to laser fields, particularly focusing on the stability of its ionic electronic ground state compared to excited states. This indicates a direct relationship between the molecule's ionization behavior and the electromagnetic radiation used in the experiments."
