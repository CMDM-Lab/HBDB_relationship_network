    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is analyzed in relation to ionization processes, specifically focusing on its ground-state ionization compared to n-butane. The study highlights that ground-state ionization is strongly favored for buta-1,3-diene, while excited-state ionization is more probable for n-butane. This indicates a significant relationship between the molecular structure of buta-1,3-diene and its ionization behavior under specific conditions."
