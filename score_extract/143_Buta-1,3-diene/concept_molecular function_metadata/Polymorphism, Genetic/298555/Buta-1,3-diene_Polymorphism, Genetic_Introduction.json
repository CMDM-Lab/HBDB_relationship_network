    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is linked to genetic polymorphisms that influence the metabolic rates of enzymes responsible for its activation and deactivation, specifically CYP2E1 and CYP2A6. These polymorphisms can affect how individuals metabolize BD, potentially impacting cancer risk assessments in exposed populations. Variants in these enzymes lead to differences in protein expression and catalytic activity, highlighting a significant relationship between BD exposure and genetic variability in metabolism."
