    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to its metabolism, specifically focusing on the oxidation processes mediated by the P450 enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP2A6. These enzymes play a crucial role in the phase I oxidation of BD, which is significant for understanding its carcinogenic potential. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can influence the metabolic activation and deactivation of BD, thereby affecting cancer risk assessments in exposed populations."
