    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to its metabolic processes and the development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for assessing human health risks, including reproductive toxicity. The synthesis of BD is implied through its mention as a chemical used in various manufacturing processes, but the focus is primarily on its metabolic pathways and risk assessment rather than on its synthesis itself."
