    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned in relation to other volatile substances, particularly in the comparison of exposure levels from cigarette smoke and cooking fumes. The study indicates that levels of buta-1,3-diene in heated oils are significantly lower than those of more volatile compounds like acrolein. This suggests that while buta-1,3-diene is categorized as a volatile substance, its presence in cooking fumes is minimal compared to other more harmful volatile compounds, indicating a lesser concern for exposure in this context."
