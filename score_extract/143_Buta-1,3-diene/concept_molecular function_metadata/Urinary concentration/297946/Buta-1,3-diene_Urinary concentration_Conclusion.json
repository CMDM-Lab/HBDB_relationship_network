    "summary": "In this context, 1,3-butadiene is associated with urinary concentrations of nicotine metabolites, indicating that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) may lead to increased urinary excretion of these metabolites. The study highlights significant correlations between personal airborne exposures to 1,3-butadiene and the concentrations of urinary nicotine metabolites, suggesting that urinary concentration can serve as a biomarker for exposure to this compound in the context of ETS."
