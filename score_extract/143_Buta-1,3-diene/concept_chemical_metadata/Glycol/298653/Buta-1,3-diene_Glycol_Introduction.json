    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to its metabolic pathways and potential reproductive risks, while glycol is not directly mentioned in terms of its relationship with BD. However, glycol could be relevant as a solvent or byproduct in chemical processes involving BD. The context primarily focuses on BD's health risks and metabolic modeling, with no explicit connection to glycol's role or effects."
