    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a precursor for the formation of certain metabolites, including DHBMA, which may be derived from its physiological metabolism. Glycol is not directly discussed in relation to Buta-1,3-diene, but both terms are part of a broader discussion on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their metabolites. The relationship is not explicitly defined, indicating a general connection through metabolic pathways rather than a direct interaction."
