    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and phenanthrene are both mentioned as sources of urinary biomarkers in a study comparing daily cooks to random controls. Specifically, the urinary biomarker PheT is associated with phenanthrene, while MHBMA is linked to buta-1,3-diene. However, the context does not elaborate on any direct interaction or significant relationship between the two compounds beyond their presence as metabolites in the study."
