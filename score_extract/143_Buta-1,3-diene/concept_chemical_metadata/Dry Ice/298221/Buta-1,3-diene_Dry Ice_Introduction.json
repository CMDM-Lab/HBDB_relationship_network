    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Dry Ice are related through the analytical methods used for determining the delivery of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in cigarette smoke. Specifically, Dry Ice is mentioned as a medium for trapping smoke constituents, including Buta-1,3-diene, during the collection process. This indicates a practical application where Dry Ice aids in the analysis of Buta-1,3-diene levels in smoke samples, highlighting their functional relationship in analytical chemistry."
