    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene (BD) and Butane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to human health risk assessments. However, the focus is primarily on BD's carcinogenic properties and its metabolic pathways, with no direct comparison or interaction with Butane discussed. They are related as VOCs but lack a significant functional relationship in this context."
