    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butane are both discussed in relation to their ionization properties under specific experimental conditions. The study compares the ionization yields of n-butane and 1,3-butadiene, highlighting differences in their ground-state and excited-state ionization tendencies. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their physical and chemical behavior rather than any direct interaction or functional relevance."
