    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene (BD) and Butene are related as they are both alkenes involved in chemical processes and metabolic pathways. The discussion focuses on the risk assessment of BD, which can be metabolized to form epoxybutene (EB) and other derivatives. While Butene is not directly mentioned as a metabolite, it is structurally related and may share similar pathways in terms of reactivity and potential health impacts, particularly in the context of human exposure and toxicity assessments."
