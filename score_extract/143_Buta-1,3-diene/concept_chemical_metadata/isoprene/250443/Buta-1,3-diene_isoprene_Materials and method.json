    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) collected using similar sampling methods in air quality studies. They are mentioned together in the context of air sampling techniques, indicating they may be analyzed for their presence in environmental samples, particularly in relation to vehicle emissions. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or biological significance."
