    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (1,3-BD) and isoprene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are analyzed for their correlation with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) markers. The study indicates that isoprene is a more suitable marker than 1,3-BD due to its higher emission levels and easier measurement. Both compounds show a good correlation with other studied compounds in relation to ETS, suggesting their relevance in environmental monitoring."
