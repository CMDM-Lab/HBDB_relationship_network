    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both identified as lower olefins monitored for their ambient air concentrations across Texas from 2002 to 2012. The study evaluates the spatial and temporal trends of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs), indicating that they are part of a broader analysis of air quality and pollution trends. However, there is no specific discussion of their chemical interactions or biological implications within the provided context."
