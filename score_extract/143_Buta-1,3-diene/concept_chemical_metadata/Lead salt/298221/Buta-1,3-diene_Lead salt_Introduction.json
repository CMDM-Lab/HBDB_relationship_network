    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and lead salt are mentioned in relation to the use of lead-salt tunable diode laser (TDL) spectroscopy for measuring gaseous constituents in cigarette smoke, including Buta-1,3-diene. The lead salt TDL is instrumental in detecting specific volatile organic compounds like Buta-1,3-diene, indicating a functional relationship where lead salt technology facilitates the analysis of this compound in smoke samples. However, the context does not elaborate on any chemical interactions between them."
