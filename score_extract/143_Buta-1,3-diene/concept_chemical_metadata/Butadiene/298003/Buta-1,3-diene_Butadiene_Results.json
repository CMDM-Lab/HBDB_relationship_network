    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are likely referring to the same compound, 1,3-butadiene, which is a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with increased leukemia risk. The study discusses the epidemiological findings related to leukemia cases in areas exposed to emissions from an oil refinery, including butadiene exposure. However, the specific relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene is not elaborated upon, suggesting they are used interchangeably without distinct discussion."
