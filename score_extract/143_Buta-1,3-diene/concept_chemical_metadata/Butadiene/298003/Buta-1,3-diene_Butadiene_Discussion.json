    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to their roles as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their potential carcinogenic effects. The text discusses the uncertainty in risk estimates for leukaemia associated with these compounds, indicating that both are likely linked due to their chemical structure and metabolism to carcinogenic forms. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond their mention as part of a broader discussion on VOC emissions and health risks."
