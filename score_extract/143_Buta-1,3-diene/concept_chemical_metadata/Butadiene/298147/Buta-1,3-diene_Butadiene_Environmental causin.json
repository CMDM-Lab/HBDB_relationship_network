    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned as part of a discussion on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are considered carcinogenic, particularly in relation to lung cancer risk. However, the terms are used interchangeably without a detailed exploration of their specific relationship or differences. Both compounds are implicated in air pollution and its health effects, but the context does not provide a direct connection between them beyond their classification as harmful VOCs."
