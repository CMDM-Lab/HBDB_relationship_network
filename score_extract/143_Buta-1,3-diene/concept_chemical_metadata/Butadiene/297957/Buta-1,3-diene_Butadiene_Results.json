    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to urinary biomarkers, specifically focusing on the metabolites derived from exposure to these compounds. Buta-1,3-diene is a specific isomer of Butadiene, and both are relevant in studies of environmental exposure and health effects. However, the context does not elaborate on their distinct roles or interactions, merely noting their presence in the analysis of urinary biomarkers."
