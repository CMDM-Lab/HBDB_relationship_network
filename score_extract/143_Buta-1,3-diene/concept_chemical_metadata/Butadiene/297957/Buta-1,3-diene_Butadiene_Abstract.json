    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to exposure levels of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their metabolites. However, the context does not provide a direct relationship or comparison between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene, as it primarily focuses on other compounds and their mercapturic acids. Both terms refer to similar chemical structures, but their specific interactions or implications in the study are not discussed."
