    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in metabolic processes. The mention of endogenous butadiene-diol suggests a metabolic pathway linking Butadiene to its derivatives, including Buta-1,3-diene. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific health implications directly connecting the two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs."
