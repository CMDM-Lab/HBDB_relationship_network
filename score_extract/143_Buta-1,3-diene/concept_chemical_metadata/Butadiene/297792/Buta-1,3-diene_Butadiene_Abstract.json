    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned in relation to their ionization properties and behavior under specific experimental conditions. However, the context primarily focuses on the ionization yields and excited states of 1,3-butadiene and n-butane, without providing a detailed discussion on the relationship between Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene. They are likely referring to the same compound, but the context does not clarify this connection explicitly."
