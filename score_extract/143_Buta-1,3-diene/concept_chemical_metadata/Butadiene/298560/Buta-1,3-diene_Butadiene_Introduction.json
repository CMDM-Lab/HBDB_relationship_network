    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene refer to the same chemical compound, 1,3-butadiene (BD), which is discussed in terms of its toxicity and carcinogenic potential. The text highlights the development of physiologically based toxicokinetic models to understand the differences in toxicity between species, particularly focusing on the metabolites of butadiene, such as epoxybutene and diepoxybutane. The relationship is direct, as Buta-1,3-diene is simply an alternative name for Butadiene, emphasizing their identity as the same substance in toxicological studies."
