    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Butadiene are mentioned as part of a study investigating exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Buta-1,3-diene is a specific isomer of Butadiene, which is highlighted as a carcinogenic VOC. The study aims to explore the relationship between urinary metabolites and inhalation exposure to these compounds, indicating a direct connection between them as they are chemically related and both implicated in health risks associated with VOC exposure."
