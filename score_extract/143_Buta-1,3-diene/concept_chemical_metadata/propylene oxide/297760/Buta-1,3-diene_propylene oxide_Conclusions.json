    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and propylene oxide are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be measured as urinary biomarkers of exposure. The method developed for assessing these compounds aims to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers based on their metabolite levels. However, the specific relationship or interaction between Buta-1,3-diene and propylene oxide is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association as part of a broader study on VOC exposure rather than a direct connection."
