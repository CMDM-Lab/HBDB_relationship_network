    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and propylene oxide are mentioned as metabolites of olefins that can form carcinogenic compounds, specifically ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The discussion revolves around the uncertainty of risk estimates for leukemia associated with low-level exposure to these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in oil refinery workers. While both compounds are linked through their metabolic pathways to potential carcinogenic effects, the context does not provide a direct interaction or detailed relationship between them."
