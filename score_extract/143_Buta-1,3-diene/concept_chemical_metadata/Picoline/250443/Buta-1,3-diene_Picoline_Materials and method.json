    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and Picoline are both mentioned as part of a list of airborne compounds measured during a study assessing tobacco-specific markers in different environments. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or significance beyond their inclusion in the same sampling analysis. They are simply part of a broader examination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the air."
