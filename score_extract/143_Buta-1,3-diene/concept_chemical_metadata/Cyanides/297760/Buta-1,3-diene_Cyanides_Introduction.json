    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and cyanides are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be metabolized in the human body, leading to the formation of mercapturic acids via the glutathione pathway. However, the relationship between these two specific compounds is not directly discussed, and they are listed among various other VOCs monitored for exposure, indicating a general association rather than a specific interaction or functional relationship."
