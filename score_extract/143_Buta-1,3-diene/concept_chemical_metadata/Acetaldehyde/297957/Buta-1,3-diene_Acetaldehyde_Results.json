    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as urinary biomarkers related to exposure from cooking activities. However, the study indicates that there were no significant differences in the levels of urinary biomarkers from buta-1,3-diene and acetaldehyde among the groups studied. This suggests that while both compounds are relevant in the context of exposure, their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon, indicating a lack of direct connection."
