    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their potential health impacts, particularly in relation to cooking exposure. However, the study found no significant differences in the levels of mercapturic acids of buta-1,3-diene or acetaldehyde-leukocyte DNA adducts between the groups, indicating a lack of direct relationship or significant interaction between these two compounds in the context of the study."
