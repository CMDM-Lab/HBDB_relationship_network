    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene (BD) and 2-butene are related through their roles in metabolic processes and risk assessments for human health. BD is a known carcinogen and is metabolized to form various compounds, including epoxybutene (EB) and diepoxybutane (DEB). The context discusses the importance of understanding these metabolic pathways for assessing reproductive risks associated with BD exposure, which may involve 2-butene as a relevant compound in the metabolic framework. However, the specific interactions between BD and 2-butene are not elaborated upon in detail."
