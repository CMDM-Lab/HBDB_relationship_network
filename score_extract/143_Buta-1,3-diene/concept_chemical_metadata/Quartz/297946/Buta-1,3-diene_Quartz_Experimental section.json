    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and quartz are mentioned in relation to environmental monitoring and personal exposure sampling. Buta-1,3-diene is sampled separately as a volatile organic compound (VOC), while quartz filters are used to collect polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between buta-1,3-diene and quartz, as they are part of different sampling processes without any indication of how they may influence each other or relate chemically or biologically."
