    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to indoor air pollution, alongside carbon particles and other carcinogenic pollutants. Both Buta-1,3-diene and carbon are implicated in the risk of lung cancer, particularly in children exposed to air pollution. However, the relationship is more about their shared role as pollutants rather than a direct interaction or specific functional relationship."
