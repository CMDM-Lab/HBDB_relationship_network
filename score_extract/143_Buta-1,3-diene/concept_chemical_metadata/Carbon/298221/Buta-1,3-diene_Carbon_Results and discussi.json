    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and carbon are related through their roles in cigarette smoke filtration. The study discusses how different carbon materials in cigarette filters affect the levels of smoke constituents, including buta-1,3-diene. The presence of carbon in the filters is crucial for reducing the concentration of harmful compounds like buta-1,3-diene in the smoke, indicating a significant relationship between the two in the context of smoke analysis and filtration efficiency."
