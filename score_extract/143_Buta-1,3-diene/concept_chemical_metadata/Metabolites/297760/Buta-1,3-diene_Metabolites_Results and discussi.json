    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is directly related to its metabolites, specifically the mercapturic acid metabolites DHBMA and MHBMA, which serve as biomarkers for exposure to this volatile organic compound (VOC). The study highlights significant correlations between these metabolites, indicating that they are formed from the metabolism of Buta-1,3-diene. This relationship underscores the importance of monitoring these metabolites as indicators of exposure to the parent compound in biological samples, particularly in smokers."
