    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose metabolites are monitored as biomarkers of exposure. The metabolites of Buta-1,3-diene, like other VOCs, are formed through metabolic processes involving glutathione and are subsequently excreted in urine. This indicates a direct relationship where Buta-1,3-diene is metabolized into specific compounds that can be tracked for exposure assessment."
