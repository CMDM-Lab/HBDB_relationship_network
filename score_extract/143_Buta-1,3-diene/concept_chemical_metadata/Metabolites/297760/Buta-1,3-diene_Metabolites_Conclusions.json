    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for which urinary metabolites are measured to assess exposure levels. The developed method aims to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers based on the levels of metabolites from various VOCs, including Buta-1,3-diene. This indicates a direct relationship where the metabolites serve as biomarkers for exposure to Buta-1,3-diene, linking it to health effects such as cancer and other impairments."
