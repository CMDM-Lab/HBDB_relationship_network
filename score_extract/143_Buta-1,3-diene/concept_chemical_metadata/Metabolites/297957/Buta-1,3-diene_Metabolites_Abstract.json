    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned alongside its metabolites, specifically in relation to the levels of mercapturic acids. However, the study indicates that there were no significant differences in the levels of mercapturic acids of 1,3-butadiene between the groups studied. This suggests that while buta-1,3-diene is a compound of interest, its metabolites did not show a notable relationship or impact in the context of the cooking exposure being investigated."
