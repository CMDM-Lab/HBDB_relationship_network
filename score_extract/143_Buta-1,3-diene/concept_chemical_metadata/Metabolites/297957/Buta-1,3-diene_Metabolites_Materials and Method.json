    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is linked to its urinary metabolites, specifically the mercapturic acid metabolites known as monohydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (MHBMA). These metabolites are quantified to assess exposure to Buta-1,3-diene, indicating a direct relationship where the metabolites serve as biomarkers for the presence and effects of Buta-1,3-diene in the body. The study highlights the importance of measuring these metabolites to understand the exposure levels and potential health impacts associated with Buta-1,3-diene."
