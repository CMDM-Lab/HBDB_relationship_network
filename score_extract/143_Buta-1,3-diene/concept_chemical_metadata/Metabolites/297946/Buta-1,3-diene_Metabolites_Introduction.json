    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a carcinogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) whose urinary metabolites may serve as biomarkers for exposure assessment. The study hypothesizes that individuals exposed to higher concentrations of buta-1,3-diene will excrete higher levels of its metabolites, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its metabolic byproducts. This suggests that monitoring these metabolites could provide a reliable alternative to direct exposure measurements."
