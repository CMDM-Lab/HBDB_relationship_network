    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a compound associated with personal airborne exposures, particularly in relation to nicotine metabolites such as cotinine and trans-3â€²-hydroxycotinine. The study indicates significant correlations between urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and airborne exposures to buta-1,3-diene, suggesting that metabolites can reflect exposure levels to this compound. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the correlation rather than a detailed metabolic pathway or mechanism."
