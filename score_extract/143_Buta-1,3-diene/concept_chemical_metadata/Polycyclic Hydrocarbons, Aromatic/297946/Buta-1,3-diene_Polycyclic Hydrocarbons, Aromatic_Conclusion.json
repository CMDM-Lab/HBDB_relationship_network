    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is identified as a significant component of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), which is also a source of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The study highlights correlations between exposure to these compounds and urinary nicotine metabolites, suggesting that both Buta-1,3-diene and PAHs contribute to the elevated cancer risk associated with ETS. This indicates a direct relationship where both compounds are linked through their common source and potential health impacts."
