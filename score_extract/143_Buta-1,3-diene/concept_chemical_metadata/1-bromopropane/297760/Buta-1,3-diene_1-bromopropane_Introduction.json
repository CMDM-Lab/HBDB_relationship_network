    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and 1-bromopropane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be metabolized in the human body to form mercapturic acids via the glutathione pathway. They are included in a list of chemicals monitored for their metabolites as biomarkers of exposure, indicating a shared relevance in studies of toxicological effects and potential health risks, particularly regarding neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not elaborated upon in detail."
