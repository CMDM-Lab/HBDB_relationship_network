    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene and toluene are both mentioned as airborne compounds measured during a study assessing tobacco-specific markers in various environments. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction; they are simply part of a broader list of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for air quality assessment. Their mention is coincidental rather than indicative of a significant connection."
