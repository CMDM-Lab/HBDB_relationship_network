    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene is identified as one of the lower olefins, which are a subset of alkenes. The study focuses on monitoring the ambient air concentrations of various lower olefins, including Buta-1,3-diene, ethylene, isoprene, and propylene, indicating that Buta-1,3-diene is categorized within the broader chemical class of alkenes. However, the specific interactions or properties of Buta-1,3-diene as an alkene are not discussed in detail."
