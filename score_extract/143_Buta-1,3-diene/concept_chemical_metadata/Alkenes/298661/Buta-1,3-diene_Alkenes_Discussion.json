    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene is identified as a specific type of alkene, which is a category of hydrocarbons characterized by at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The mention of buta-1,3-diene alongside other alkenes like propylene and ethylene highlights its classification within the broader group of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to ground-level ozone formation. However, the relationship is primarily categorical without detailed discussion of specific interactions or properties."
