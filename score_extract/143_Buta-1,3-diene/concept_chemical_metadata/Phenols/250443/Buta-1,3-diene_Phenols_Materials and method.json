    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and phenols are both mentioned as part of a broader analysis of airborne compounds, particularly in relation to tobacco smoke and environmental monitoring. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the list of measured compounds. They are part of a larger study on tobacco-specific markers, but their relationship is not elaborated upon."
