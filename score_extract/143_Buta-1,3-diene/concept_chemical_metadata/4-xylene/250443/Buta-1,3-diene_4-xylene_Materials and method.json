    "summary": "In this context, Buta-1,3-diene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a broader analysis of airborne concentrations of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in relation to tobacco smoke exposure. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the list of measured compounds. They are part of a larger study on air quality but do not exhibit a significant relationship in this context."
