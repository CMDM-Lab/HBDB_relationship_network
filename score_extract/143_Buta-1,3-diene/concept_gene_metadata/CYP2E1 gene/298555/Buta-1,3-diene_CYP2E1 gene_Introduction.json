    "summary": "In this context, buta-1,3-diene (BD) is discussed in relation to the CYP2E1 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of BD. The text highlights that genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2E1 gene can influence the enzyme's expression and activity, thereby affecting the metabolic rates of BD and its associated cancer risk. This suggests a significant relationship between BD exposure and the genetic factors that modulate its metabolism through CYP2E1."
