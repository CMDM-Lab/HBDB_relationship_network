    "summary": "In this context, sulfanylidenemethanone and carbonyl sulfide are both mentioned as trace gases potentially produced by bacteria in the breath of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The study investigates the concentrations of carbonyl sulfide, among other sulfides, in the breath samples of CF patients and healthy controls. However, the specific relationship between sulfanylidenemethanone and carbonyl sulfide is not directly addressed, as they are listed among other compounds without detailed interaction or comparison."
