    "summary": "In this context, sulfanylidenemethanone is indirectly related to cystic fibrosis (CF) through the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of CF patients. The study measures concentrations of various sulfur-containing gases, including carbonyl sulfide (OCS), in CF patients compared to healthy controls. While sulfanylidenemethanone is not explicitly mentioned as being measured, the focus on sulfur compounds suggests a potential relevance to the biochemical processes in CF, particularly regarding breath analysis as a diagnostic tool."
