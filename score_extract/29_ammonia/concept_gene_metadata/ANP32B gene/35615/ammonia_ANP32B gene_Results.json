    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned in relation to leachate levels over time, but there is no direct connection to the ANP32B gene. The discussion focuses on environmental factors affecting ammonia levels in landfill leachate, without any reference to the ANP32B gene or its biological significance. Thus, the relationship between ammonia and the ANP32B gene is not established."
