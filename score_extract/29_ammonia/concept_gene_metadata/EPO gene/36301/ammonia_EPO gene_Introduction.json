    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as one of the gas-phase markers measured during the study of exposure to an electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS). However, there is no direct discussion or evidence linking ammonia to the EPO gene, which is typically associated with erythropoiesis and oxygen regulation. The relationship between ammonia and the EPO gene is not explored, indicating a lack of relevance between the two terms in this context."
