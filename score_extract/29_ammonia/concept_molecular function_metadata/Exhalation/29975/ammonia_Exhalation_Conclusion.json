    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned in relation to exhalation, specifically noting that there was no significant increase in ammonia levels in exhaled breath following the use of a non-tobacco vapor (NTV) product. This indicates that ammonia concentrations remained stable and did not contribute to changes in indoor air quality (IAQ) during the study, suggesting a lack of direct relationship between ammonia and exhalation in the context of NTV use."
