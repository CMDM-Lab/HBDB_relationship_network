    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as a gas emitted during solid-state fermentation (SSF) processes, which is linked to environmental impacts such as eutrophication. The release of ammonia contributes to nutrient loading in aquatic systems, leading to excessive growth of algae and subsequent ecological imbalances. The relationship is highlighted as ammonia is a key factor in the eutrophication process, indicating its role in environmental degradation."
