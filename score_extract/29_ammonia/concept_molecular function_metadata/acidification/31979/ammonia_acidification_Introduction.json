    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as a gas emitted during solid-state fermentation (SSF) processes, which is linked to environmental impacts such as acidification. The emission of ammonia contributes to the generation of unpleasant odors and is associated with acidification and eutrophication, indicating a significant relationship between ammonia emissions and the process of acidification in the environment."
