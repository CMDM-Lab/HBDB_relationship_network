    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a pollutant studied in relation to composting plant operations, specifically during the reception phase of waste. The reception phase involves collecting and processing waste materials, which can lead to the emission of ammonia and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the relationship between ammonia and the reception phase is not deeply explored beyond its mention as a pollutant associated with the operational data collection."
