    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a compound analyzed at landfill leaks, while 'Leak NOS' likely refers to a specific type of leak detection system or methodology. However, there is no direct discussion of how ammonia interacts with or relates to Leak NOS. The focus is primarily on the measurement of ammonia concentrations at landfill sites without elaborating on any specific relationship with Leak NOS."
