    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is analyzed in relation to its concentration and behavior under varying physical conditions, including pressure. The study employs equations that incorporate pressure as a physical agent affecting the mass transfer and saturation concentration of ammonia in the digestate. This indicates a direct relationship where pressure influences ammonia dynamics during the analysis."
