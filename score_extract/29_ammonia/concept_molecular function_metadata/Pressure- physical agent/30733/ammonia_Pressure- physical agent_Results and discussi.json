    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its mass transfer during vacuum thermal stripping under various pressure conditions. The study indicates that vacuum pressure enhances the gas-phase mass transfer of ammonia, but its effectiveness diminishes below a certain pressure threshold. The relationship highlights how physical pressure influences the behavior and transfer efficiency of ammonia in thermal processes."
