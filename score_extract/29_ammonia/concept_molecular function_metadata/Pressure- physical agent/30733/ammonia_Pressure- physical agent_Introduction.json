    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its mass transfer kinetics during a process influenced by pressure, specifically in vacuum thermal stripping. The study aims to understand how varying boiling point temperatures and reduced pressure affect the transfer of ammonia from digestate or wastewater. The relationship is significant as pressure is a physical agent that impacts the behavior and efficiency of ammonia transfer in the system being studied."
