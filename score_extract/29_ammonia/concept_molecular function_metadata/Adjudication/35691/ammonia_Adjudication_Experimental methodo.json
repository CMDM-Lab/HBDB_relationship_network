    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a pollutant studied in composting plants, while 'adjudication' refers to the process of making a formal judgment or decision. However, there is no direct relationship or interaction discussed between ammonia and adjudication. The context focuses on data collection and analysis of emissions rather than any adjudicative processes related to ammonia levels or their implications."
