    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its concentration in various digestates and its reaction with sulfuric acid during the anaerobic digestion process. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears unrelated to the chemical processes described, as it typically refers to a legal or formal decision-making process, not a chemical or biological interaction. Therefore, there is no meaningful relationship between ammonia and adjudication in this context."
