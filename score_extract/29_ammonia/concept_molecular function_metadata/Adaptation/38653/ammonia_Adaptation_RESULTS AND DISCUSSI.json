    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is produced as a byproduct of a reaction catalyzed by cystathionine gamma-synthase in H. pylori, particularly under low pH conditions. The potential increase in ammonia availability is linked to the adaptation process of H. pylori, allowing it to survive and thrive in the acidic environment of the stomach. This suggests that ammonia plays a role in the bacterium's metabolic adaptation to acidic conditions, facilitating its colonization and survival."
