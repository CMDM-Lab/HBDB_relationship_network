    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as one of the gases emitted during solid-state fermentation (SSF) processes, alongside greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emission of ammonia is linked to various environmental impacts, including unpleasant odors, acidification, eutrophication, and the formation of photochemical oxidants. The study aims to quantify these emissions to better understand their environmental consequences."
