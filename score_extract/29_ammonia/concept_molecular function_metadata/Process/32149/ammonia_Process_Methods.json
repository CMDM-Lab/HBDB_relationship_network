    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is measured as part of the composting process, specifically at the gas outlet of a composting reactor. The measurement of ammonia concentration is crucial for monitoring the efficiency and environmental impact of the composting process. The methodology described involves using an ammonia sensor and gas sampling techniques to analyze volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during composting, indicating that ammonia is a significant component of the process being studied."
