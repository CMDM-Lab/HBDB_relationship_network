    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a pollutant in a biofiltration process aimed at treating air contaminated with inorganic compounds. The process involves using formulated materials that release carbonate, which can serve as a carbon source for microorganisms. This indicates that ammonia is part of the substrate being processed, highlighting its relevance in the biofiltration process, although the specific interactions are not deeply explored."
