    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is produced as a byproduct of a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase, which is involved in methionine biosynthesis. The production of ammonia is highlighted as part of H. pylori's adaptation process to acidic environments, indicating its relevance in metabolic processes. However, the specific relationship between ammonia and the broader concept of 'Process' is not explicitly detailed, making the connection somewhat indirect."
