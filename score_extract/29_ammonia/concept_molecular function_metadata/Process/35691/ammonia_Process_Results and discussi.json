    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to the composting process, specifically its emissions during the aerobic decomposition of organic waste. The study highlights how ammonia emissions are influenced by various factors such as temperature, composting duration, and the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio of the initial waste. The data indicates that ammonia emissions are a significant byproduct of the composting process, representing a notable percentage of the nitrogen content in the composting material."
