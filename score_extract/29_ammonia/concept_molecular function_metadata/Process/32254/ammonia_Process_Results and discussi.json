    "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) is discussed in relation to its emissions during the composting process at a municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plant. The analysis highlights the significance of ammonia compared to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in emissions, particularly in the early stages of composting. The ratios of ammonia to other compounds are used to identify emission sources, indicating its relevance in monitoring and understanding the composting process."
