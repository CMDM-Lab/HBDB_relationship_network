    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is central to various recovery processes investigated for its extraction from digestate, including thermal stripping and acid absorption. The processes aim to convert and recover ammonia efficiently, producing marketable products like ammonium sulfate. The development of these processes addresses economic and technical challenges in ammonia recovery, highlighting the significance of ammonia in the context of waste management and resource recovery."
