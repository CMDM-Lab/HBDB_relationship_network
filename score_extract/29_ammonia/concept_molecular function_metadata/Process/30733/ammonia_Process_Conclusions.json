    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is linked to the process of vacuum thermal stripping, which is described as an innovative method for efficiently recovering ammonia from digestate and ammonia-rich wastewater. This process is highlighted for its advantages over traditional thermal stripping, including higher flow rates and lower operational costs, indicating a significant relationship between ammonia and the recovery process."
