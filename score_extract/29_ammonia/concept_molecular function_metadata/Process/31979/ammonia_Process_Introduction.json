    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as a significant gaseous emission associated with the solid-state fermentation (SSF) process. The environmental impacts of SSF processes are highlighted, particularly regarding the release of ammonia and other gases, which contribute to unpleasant odors and environmental issues like acidification and eutrophication. The relationship indicates that ammonia is a byproduct of the SSF process, affecting its overall environmental footprint."
