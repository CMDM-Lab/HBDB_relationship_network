    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its emissions from different waste treatments, particularly highlighting its release from hair wastes during HW trials and raw sludge during WR processes. The relationship indicates that ammonia emissions are influenced by the type of waste treatment process, with varying nitrogen content affecting the levels of ammonia released. This suggests that the process of waste treatment significantly impacts ammonia emissions, linking the two terms through their interaction in environmental management."
