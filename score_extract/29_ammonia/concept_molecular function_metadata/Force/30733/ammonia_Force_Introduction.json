    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its mass transfer during the stripping process, where the driving force is defined as the difference between free ammonia concentration and its saturation concentration. This relationship highlights how variations in temperature and vacuum pressure influence the concentration of free ammonia, thereby affecting the driving force for its transfer. The context emphasizes the physical principles governing ammonia behavior rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction."
