    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its mass transfer characteristics, particularly how its transfer coefficient is influenced by air velocity and temperature. The term 'Force' refers to the driving force behind ammonia mass transfer, which decreases as the stripping temperature lowers. This indicates a significant relationship where the efficiency of ammonia transfer is directly affected by the driving force, particularly in terms of temperature and vacuum conditions."
