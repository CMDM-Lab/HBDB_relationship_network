    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and force are related through the process of vacuum thermal stripping in an anaerobic digester. The driving force for stripping ammonia is influenced by both the feed temperature and the vacuum pressure applied. The study highlights how these parameters optimize the recovery of ammonia, indicating a direct relationship between the physical forces involved and the efficiency of ammonia removal from wastewater."
