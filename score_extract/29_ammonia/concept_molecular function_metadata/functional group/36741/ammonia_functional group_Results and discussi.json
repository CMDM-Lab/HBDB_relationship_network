    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its removal and the role of functional groups on pine bark that facilitate its transfer in the liquid phase. The acidic surface functional groups of pine bark are suggested to chemically neutralize ammonia, enhancing microbiological activity and promoting better growth conditions. This indicates a significant interaction between ammonia and the functional groups present in the material used."
