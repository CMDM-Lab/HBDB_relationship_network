    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is generated from the digestion of food waste and is subsequently removed through a reflux process involving a distilling column. The setup allows for the absorption of gaseous ammonia into a sulfuric acid solution, indicating a direct relationship where reflux is utilized to manage ammonia levels in the digestate treatment process. This highlights the importance of reflux in the effective removal of ammonia during wastewater treatment."
