    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is produced as a byproduct of the metabolic breakdown of glutamine in H. pylori, which is crucial for the bacterium's survival in acidic environments. The transcription of the gdhA gene, which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase necessary for ammonia production, is significantly increased under these conditions. This indicates a direct relationship between ammonia production and genetic transcription processes that facilitate H. pylori's adaptation to acidic pH."
