    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is produced as a byproduct of urease activity in Helicobacter pylori, which hydrolyzes urea. The generation of ammonia contributes to maintaining a proton motive force across the inner membrane of the bacterium, essential for its survival in the acidic gastric environment. This relationship highlights the role of ammonia in buffering the local pH and supporting the bacterium's colonization and persistence in the stomach."
