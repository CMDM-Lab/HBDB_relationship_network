    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its concentration levels in digestate during anaerobic digestion processes. The text indicates that reducing ammonia concentration is crucial to prevent inhibition of methanogens, which are essential for stable digestion. While inhibitors are not explicitly defined, the implication is that high ammonia levels act as inhibitors to methanogenic activity, thus affecting the efficiency of anaerobic digesters. The thermal stripping process is highlighted as a method to manage ammonia levels effectively, allowing for improved operational conditions in digesters."
