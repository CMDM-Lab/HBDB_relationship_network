    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is produced as a byproduct of the enzymatic activity of cystathionine gamma-synthase in H. pylori, particularly under low pH conditions. The mention of ammonia's increased availability suggests a recurring theme in H. pylori's adaptation to acidic environments, indicating that ammonia may play a role in the bacterium's survival and recurrence in the gastric niche. However, the specific relationship between ammonia and recurrence is not explicitly detailed."
