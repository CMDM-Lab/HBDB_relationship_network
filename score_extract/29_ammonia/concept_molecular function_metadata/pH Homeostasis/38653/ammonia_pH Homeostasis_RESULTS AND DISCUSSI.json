    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is produced from the deamination of glutamine, which is crucial for the survival of H. pylori in acidic environments. The increased concentration of ammonia helps maintain pH homeostasis within the bacterial cell, acting as a buffer against acidity. This metabolic pathway is essential for the bacteria's adaptation to low pH conditions, highlighting the direct relationship between ammonia production and pH regulation."
