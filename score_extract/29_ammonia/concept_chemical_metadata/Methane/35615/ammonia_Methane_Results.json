    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and methane are indirectly related through their roles in landfill waste decomposition. Ammonia concentrations are observed to decline during the methanogenic phase of decomposition, which is characterized by methane production. While ammonia levels decrease due to biological assimilation, methane is produced as a byproduct of anaerobic digestion. The relationship highlights the interplay between nitrogen compounds and methane generation in landfill environments, although the specific interactions between ammonia and methane are not detailed."
