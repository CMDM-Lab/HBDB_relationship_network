    "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are both mentioned as emissions produced during combustion experiments. While ammonia is listed alongside nitrogen oxides, the context does not provide specific details about their interaction or relationship. The focus is primarily on the emissions of nitrogen oxides, particularly NO gas, without elaborating on how ammonia relates to or affects nitrogen oxides in this scenario."
