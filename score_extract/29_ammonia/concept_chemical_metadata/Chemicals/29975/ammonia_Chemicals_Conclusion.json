    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as a chemical constituent generated from the use of Novel Tobacco Vapor (NTV) products. The study evaluates indoor air quality (IAQ) by analyzing various chemical emissions, including ammonia, which is compared to emissions from traditional cigarettes. While ammonia is mentioned as part of the chemical profile of NTV, the relationship is primarily descriptive, focusing on its presence rather than a deeper interaction with other chemicals."
