    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is described as a molecule that can donate electrons to metals, specifically gold (Au) and silver (Ag) nanoparticles. The interaction between ammonia and these metals is highlighted through the red-shift observed in the stretching band of 1,4-PDI, indicating a significant electronic interaction. This suggests that ammonia plays a crucial role in modifying the electronic properties of metal nanoparticles, which is relevant in the study of their chemical behavior."
