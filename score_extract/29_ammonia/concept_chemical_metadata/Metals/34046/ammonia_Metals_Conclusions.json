    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is examined in relation to its interaction with metal nanoparticles (specifically gold and silver) in the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights how ammonia affects the NC stretching vibration of 1,4-PDI in nanogap electrodes, causing a red-shift due to electron donation from ammonia to the metal nanoparticles. This interaction suggests a significant relationship between ammonia and metals, particularly in how ammonia influences the electronic properties of metal nanoparticles under specific conditions."
