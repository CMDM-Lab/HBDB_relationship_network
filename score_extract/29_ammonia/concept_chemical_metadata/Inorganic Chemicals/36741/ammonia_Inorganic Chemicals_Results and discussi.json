    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as an inorganic compound relevant to a biofiltration process aimed at treating air pollution. The study discusses the chemical properties of formulated materials that can interact with inorganic chemicals like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. The carbonate in these materials may serve as a carbon source for microorganisms involved in the biofiltration process, indicating a functional relationship between ammonia and inorganic chemicals in environmental remediation efforts."
