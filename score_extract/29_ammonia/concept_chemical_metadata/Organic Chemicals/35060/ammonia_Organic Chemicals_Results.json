    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as a byproduct of fires involving polyamide materials, with its levels being significantly lower than those of hydrogen cyanide (HCN). While ammonia is classified as an organic chemical, the context primarily focuses on the emissions of various organic compounds, including BTEX and formaldehyde, without detailing a specific interaction or functional relationship between ammonia and organic chemicals. Thus, the relationship is more about classification rather than direct relevance."
