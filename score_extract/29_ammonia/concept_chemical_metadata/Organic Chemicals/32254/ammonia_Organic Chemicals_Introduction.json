    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is mentioned as one of the emissions characterized from a municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plant, alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While ammonia is a type of organic chemical, the relationship is primarily about its presence in emissions rather than a detailed interaction or functional significance with other organic chemicals. The study focuses on identifying sources of emissions rather than exploring the specific roles of ammonia within the broader category of organic chemicals."
