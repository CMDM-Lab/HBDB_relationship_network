    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its recovery and stripping from an acid solution, which also involves volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While ammonia is a specific compound, organic chemicals refer to a broader category that includes VOCs. The relationship is indirect, as ammonia is part of the process involving organic chemicals but does not have a direct interaction or specific significance with them in the described experiments."
