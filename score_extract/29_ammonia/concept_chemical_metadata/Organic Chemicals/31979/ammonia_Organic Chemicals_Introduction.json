    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is identified as a gaseous emission resulting from the solid-state fermentation (SSF) process, which also involves organic chemicals. The relationship highlights that ammonia, along with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), contributes to environmental impacts such as unpleasant odors and ecological issues like acidification and eutrophication. While ammonia is a specific emission, organic chemicals represent a broader category of compounds involved in the SSF process, indicating a connection through their shared environmental consequences."
