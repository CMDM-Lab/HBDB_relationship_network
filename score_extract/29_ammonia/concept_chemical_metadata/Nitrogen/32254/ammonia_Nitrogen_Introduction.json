    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is highlighted as a significant emission from composting processes, particularly when nitrogen content in the composting materials is high. The relationship between ammonia and nitrogen is intrinsic, as ammonia (NH3) is a nitrogenous compound that can be produced from the decomposition of organic matter containing nitrogen. The emissions of ammonia are influenced by factors such as the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio, temperature, and pH levels during composting, indicating a direct connection between nitrogen content and ammonia production."
