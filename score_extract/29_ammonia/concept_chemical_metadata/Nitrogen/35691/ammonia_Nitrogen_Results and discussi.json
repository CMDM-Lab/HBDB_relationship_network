    "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) is discussed as a significant emission resulting from the composting process, representing a substantial portion of the nitrogen content in the composting material. The study highlights that ammonia emissions can account for 24-33% of the nitrogen in the starting compost, indicating a direct relationship between ammonia and nitrogen, as ammonia is a nitrogenous compound released during decomposition. The percentage of nitrogen represented by ammonia emissions underscores its role in the nitrogen cycle within composting systems."
