    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and nitrogen are related through the discussion of nutrient availability for biomass growth. The text indicates that while ammonia removal occurs, the substrate used does not provide nitrogen. However, the formulated material UP 20 compensates by supplying the necessary nitrogen for biomass stimulation, highlighting the importance of nitrogen in supporting growth, even in the absence of direct nitrogen provision from the substrate."
