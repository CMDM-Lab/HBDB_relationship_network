    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and nitrogen are related through their roles in the release and utilization of nutrients in formulated materials. Ammonia emissions are noted as a byproduct of certain materials, while nitrogen is highlighted as a better nutrient source. The discussion suggests that ammonia, a nitrogen compound, impacts the pH and bacterial growth conditions, indicating a functional relationship between the two in the context of material formulation and microbial activity."
