    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and solanesol are both mentioned as markers of exposure in studies comparing the emissions from electrically heated cigarette smoking systems (EHCSS) to conventional cigarettes. Ammonia is categorized as a gas-phase marker, while solanesol is identified as a particulate-phase marker. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ammonia and solanesol beyond their roles as exposure markers in the study."
