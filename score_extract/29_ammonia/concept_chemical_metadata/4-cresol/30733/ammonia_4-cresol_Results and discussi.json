    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and 4-cresol are mentioned in relation to the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in acid solutions during laboratory experiments involving dairy manure digestate. While ammonia is noted as being absorbed in the acid solutions, 4-cresol (4-methylphenol) is identified as one of the VOCs frequently found. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interaction or specific relationship beyond their presence in the same experimental setup."
