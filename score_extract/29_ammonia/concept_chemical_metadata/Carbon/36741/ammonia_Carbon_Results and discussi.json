    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and carbon are related through their roles in a biofiltration process aimed at treating air polluted by inorganic compounds. The carbonate present in the formulated materials can serve as a carbon source for microorganisms that may utilize ammonia. The study discusses the dissolution rates of carbon and other elements, indicating their potential interactions in the biofiltration system, particularly in the context of microbial activity and nutrient availability."
