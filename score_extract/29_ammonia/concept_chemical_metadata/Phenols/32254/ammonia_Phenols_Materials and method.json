    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and phenols are connected through a chemical analysis method that involves the reaction of ammonia ions with phenol and sodium hypochlorite, enhanced by sodium nitroprusside. This reaction produces a color change that can be quantified using a spectrophotometer, indicating a direct analytical relationship between the two compounds in the context of measuring ammonia emissions from composting fractions."
