    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium are discussed in relation to their behavior during the vacuum thermal stripping of dairy manure digestate. Ammonia is noted for its role in forming ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) during the process, with high concentrations of suspended solids affecting ammonia dissociation and thus influencing the overall dynamics of ammonium formation. The relationship is significant as it highlights the conversion and interaction between ammonia and its ionized form, ammonium, in the context of nutrient recovery from waste."
