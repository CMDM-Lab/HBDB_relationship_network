    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium are related through their chemical equilibrium in aqueous solutions, particularly under varying vacuum pressures. The discussion focuses on the fraction of free ammonia (NH3) and its saturation concentration, which is influenced by the presence of ammonium ions (NH4+). The equations provided illustrate the relationship between these two forms of nitrogen, emphasizing their interconversion and the impact of environmental conditions on their concentrations."
