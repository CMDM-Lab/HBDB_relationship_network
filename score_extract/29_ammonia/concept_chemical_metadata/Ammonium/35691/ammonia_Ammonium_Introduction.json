    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium are closely related as ammonia (NH3) is the gaseous form of nitrogen that can be emitted during composting, while ammonium (NH4+) is its ionized form that can exist in solution. The discussion highlights ammonia emissions during composting processes, which are influenced by various factors, including temperature and pH, suggesting a direct relationship between the two forms of nitrogen in the context of waste management and environmental impact."
