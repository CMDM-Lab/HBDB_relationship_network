    "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) are discussed in relation to their chemical equilibrium in leachate with varying pH levels. The text indicates that under acidic conditions, ammonium predominates due to the solubility of ammonia in water. The study highlights the conditions affecting ammonia emissions and the balance between these two forms, emphasizing their interrelated nature in environmental chemistry."
