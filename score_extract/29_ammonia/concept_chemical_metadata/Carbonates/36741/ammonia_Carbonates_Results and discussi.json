    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and carbonates are related through their roles in a biofiltration process aimed at treating air polluted by inorganic compounds. The carbonates present in the formulated materials can serve as a carbon source for microorganisms that may utilize ammonia, indicating a functional relationship where carbonates support microbial activity in the degradation of ammonia. The study highlights the importance of both components in the context of biofiltration, although specific interactions are not deeply explored."
