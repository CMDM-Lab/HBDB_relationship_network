    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its solubility and behavior in leachate with varying pH levels. The mention of alkalies is implied through the reference to a more alkaline leachate (pH ca. 8), which affects the equilibrium between ammonia and ammonium ions. The relationship indicates that higher pH (alkaline conditions) can influence ammonia emissions, but the connection is not deeply explored beyond this observation."
