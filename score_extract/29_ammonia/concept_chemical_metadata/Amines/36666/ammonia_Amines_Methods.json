    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and amines are related through the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from PVC materials and adhesives. The study notes that the measurement of ammonia is non-specific and includes 'aliphatic' amines, indicating that both compounds are part of the broader category of emissions being investigated. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond this classification."
