    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and aldehydes are both mentioned as products of combustion during fires involving polyamide materials. While ammonia is noted to be present in lower amounts compared to hydrogen cyanide and is below detection limits in some experiments, aldehydes, including formaldehyde, are identified as major organic compounds emitted. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ammonia and aldehydes beyond their presence in the same environmental context."
