    "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) and aldehydes are both identified as gas-phase markers measured during the study of exposure to emissions from an electrically heated cigarette smoking system (EHCSS). While ammonia is specifically mentioned as a gas-phase marker, aldehydes are represented as part of the total volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The relationship is primarily based on their classification as markers of exposure rather than any direct interaction or functional relationship."
