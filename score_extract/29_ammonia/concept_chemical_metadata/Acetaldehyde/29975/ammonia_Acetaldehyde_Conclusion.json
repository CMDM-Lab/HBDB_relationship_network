    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as components of the emissions from a non-tobacco vapor (NTV) product. However, their relationship is not directly discussed, as the focus is on the overall emissions and their impact on indoor air quality (IAQ). Both substances are present in the simulation chamber, but there is no indication of interaction or specific relevance between them beyond their co-presence in the study."
