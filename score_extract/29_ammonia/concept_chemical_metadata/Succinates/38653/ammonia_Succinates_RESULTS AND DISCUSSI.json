    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and succinates are connected through the enzymatic activity of cystathionine gamma-synthase, which can produce succinate and ammonia in the absence of l-cysteine. This reaction highlights a metabolic pathway where succinates are formed alongside ammonia, indicating a potential link in the metabolic adaptation of H. pylori to acidic conditions. The production of both compounds suggests a relationship in the context of amino acid metabolism and microbial adaptation."
