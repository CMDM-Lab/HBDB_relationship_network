    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonia nitrogen are related as indicators of wastewater quality. Ammonia nitrogen is a specific form of nitrogen that includes ammonia, and both are analyzed in relation to other wastewater parameters like temperature, pH, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). The negative correlation between ammonia nitrogen and other factors suggests their interdependence in the context of organic degradation processes in wastewater treatment."
