    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its removal from digestate through vacuum thermal stripping, while Protium, a stable isotope of hydrogen, is not directly mentioned or related to the ammonia stripping process. The context focuses on the efficiency of ammonia removal and the conditions affecting it, without establishing any connection to Protium or its properties. Therefore, there is no relevant interaction or relationship between ammonia and Protium in this scenario."
