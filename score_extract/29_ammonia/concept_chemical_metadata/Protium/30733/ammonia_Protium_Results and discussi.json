    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its concentration and behavior during vacuum thermal stripping of dairy manure digestate, while Protium, a hydrogen isotope, is not directly mentioned or related to the processes described. The focus is on the physical properties and mass transfer of ammonia under varying temperatures and vacuum conditions, with no evident connection to Protium or its implications in the study."
