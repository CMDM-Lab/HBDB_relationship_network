    "summary": "In this context, ammonia is discussed in relation to its effect on the NC stretching vibration of 1,4-PDI in nanogap electrodes. The interaction between ammonia and metal nanoparticles (Au and Ag) is highlighted, where ammonia donates electrons, causing a red-shift in the NC stretching peak. However, the term 'Atom' is not explicitly defined or discussed in relation to ammonia, making the connection between them unclear."
