    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and chlorobenzene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in leachate samples. However, the discussion focuses on the modeling and forecasting of VOC data, indicating that both substances did not fit well with the projected values during the specified period. There is no direct interaction or relationship between ammonia and chlorobenzene discussed beyond their inclusion in the same analysis."
