    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and sodium hypochlorite are involved in a chemical analysis method where ammonia ions react with phenol and sodium hypochlorite, with the reaction enhanced by sodium nitroprusside. This reaction produces a color change that can be quantified using a spectrophotometer, indicating a direct analytical relationship between the two substances in measuring ammonia levels in composting fractions."
