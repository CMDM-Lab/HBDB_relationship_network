    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and toluene are both mentioned as components of emissions from fires involving polyamide materials. However, their relationship is not directly discussed, as ammonia is noted to be present in lower amounts compared to hydrogen cyanide and is not highlighted in relation to toluene or other VOCs. The mention of both compounds occurs within a broader discussion of emitted organic compounds without any specific interaction or functional relationship established between them."
