    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and toluene are both mentioned as parameters analyzed in a model assessing leachate quality from a landfill. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed, and they are presented as part of a broader analysis of various chemical trends without any direct interaction or functional connection between them. The model indicates decreasing trends for both substances, but no specific link is established."
