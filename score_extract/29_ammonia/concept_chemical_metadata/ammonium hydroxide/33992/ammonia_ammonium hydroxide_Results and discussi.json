    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and ammonium hydroxide are closely related through the chemical reaction that occurs when ammonia gas interacts with water. The formation of ammonium hydroxide, a strongly alkaline solution, is highlighted as a significant concern due to its potential to cause severe thermal injuries to tissues, particularly in the respiratory system. This relationship underscores the hazardous nature of ammonia emissions from charcoal combustion, which can exceed safety guidelines and contribute to health risks."
