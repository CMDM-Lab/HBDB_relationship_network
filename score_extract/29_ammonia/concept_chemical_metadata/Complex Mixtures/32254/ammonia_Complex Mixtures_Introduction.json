    "summary": "In this context, ammonia (NH3) is identified as one of the components contributing to the odorous emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants, which are described as complex mixtures of various organic compounds and gases. The characterization of these emissions, including ammonia, is crucial for identifying sources of odors and improving waste treatment processes to mitigate these emissions. Thus, ammonia is part of the broader category of complex mixtures that contribute to the odor problem in MSW treatment facilities."
