    "summary": "In this context, ammonia and sodium sulfide are both used as target compounds in experiments designed to simulate conditions for biofiltration. They are introduced alternately to assess their non-consumption levels, indicating their relevance in the treatment of these compounds in microbial metabolism. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of biofiltration processes in removing these specific pollutants."
