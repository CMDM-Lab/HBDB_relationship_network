    "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is identified as a product of fermentation processes involving Lactobacillus buchneri, a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium. The presence of this compound in corn silage is attributed to the fermentation activity of this specific LAB, which converts lactate into acetate and subsequently produces propane-1,2-diol. This indicates a direct relationship between the fermentation process and the production of propane-1,2-diol in silage."
