    "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is mentioned as a compound produced during the fermentation process of corn silage, specifically attributed to the activity of Lactobacillus buchneri. The fermentation process is influenced by various factors, including the type of inoculant used, which can alter the fermentation patterns and the resultant chemical composition of the silage, including the production of propane-1,2-diol. This indicates a direct relationship between the fermentation process and the presence of propane-1,2-diol as a byproduct."
