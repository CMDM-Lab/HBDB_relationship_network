    "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol is mentioned as a substrate that can be converted into propionic acid by specific microbial communities, particularly Lactobacillus diolivorans. This highlights a metabolic relationship where propane-1,2-diol serves as a precursor in the anaerobic fermentation process, leading to the production of propionic acid, which is significant in silage fermentation."
