    "summary": "In this context, propane-1,2-diol (also known as propylene glycol) and 1-propanol are indirectly related through the fermentation process of corn silage. The text mentions that n-propanol can be produced from the anaerobic conversion of propane-1,2-diol by bacteria. The presence of formic acid-based additives inhibits this bacterial conversion, leading to lower concentrations of n-propanol. This indicates a metabolic relationship where the presence of one compound affects the production of the other during fermentation."
