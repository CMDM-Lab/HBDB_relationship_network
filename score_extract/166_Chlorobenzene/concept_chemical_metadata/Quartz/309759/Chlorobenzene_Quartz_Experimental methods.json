    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is used as a gas to test the response of a sensing membrane immobilized on a quartz cell. The quartz serves as a substrate for the PTA thin film, which interacts with chlorobenzene to measure absorbance changes. The relationship is primarily functional, where quartz acts as a medium for the detection of chlorobenzene's presence through optical measurements."
