    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as an aromatic hydrocarbon that, when inhaled, can lead to inflammatory responses in lung epithelial cells. The exposure to chlorobenzene correlates with increased secretion of inflammatory mediators like MCP-1 and IL-8, which are critical in allergic inflammation and pulmonary disorders. This highlights chlorobenzene's role as a specific example of aromatic hydrocarbons that can induce adverse biological effects, particularly in respiratory health."
