    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that the OWG sensor can detect, specifically among other aromatic hydrocarbon gases like benzene and toluene. The sensor demonstrates a strong response to chlorobenzene, indicating its relevance as a hydrocarbon gas. The study emphasizes the sensor's effectiveness in sensing chlorobenzene compared to other VOCs, highlighting its significance in the detection of hydrocarbon gases."
