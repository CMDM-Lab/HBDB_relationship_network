    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its decomposition pathways, particularly focusing on the Câ€“Cl bond scission that is characteristic of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The weaker bond strength of chlorobenzene compared to benzene leads to specific reaction mechanisms during pyrolysis, highlighting its role as a chlorinated hydrocarbon. The study emphasizes the chemical-kinetic modeling of chlorobenzene's behavior, which is relevant to understanding the broader category of chlorinated hydrocarbons."
