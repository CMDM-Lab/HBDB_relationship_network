    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) are both mentioned in relation to the analysis of aromatic compounds and their calibration curves. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between these two compounds. The focus is more on the sensitivity and selectivity of various compounds in analytical methods rather than on a functional or chemical relationship between chlorobenzene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III)."
