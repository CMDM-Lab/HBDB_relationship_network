    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is shown to modulate the activity of human lung epithelial cells, particularly enhancing the production of inflammatory mediators MCP-1 and IL-8. The relationship to metabolites is highlighted through the suggestion that the toxic effects of chlorobenzene may be mediated by reactive metabolites that covalently bind to cellular structures, implicating the role of glutathione (GSH) in this process. The depletion of GSH following chlorobenzene exposure suggests a significant interaction between chlorobenzene and its metabolites in influencing cellular responses and inflammation."
