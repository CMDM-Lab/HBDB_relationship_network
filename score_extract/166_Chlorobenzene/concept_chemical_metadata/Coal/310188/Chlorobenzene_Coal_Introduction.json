    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and coal are related through their roles as substances investigated for adsorption performance on activated carbon. The study compares coconut shell-derived activated carbon with commercial coal activated carbon in terms of their ability to adsorb chlorobenzene and toluene. The research focuses on the physicochemical properties and adsorption mechanisms of these compounds, highlighting the significance of coal as a reference material in evaluating the adsorption capabilities of activated carbon."
