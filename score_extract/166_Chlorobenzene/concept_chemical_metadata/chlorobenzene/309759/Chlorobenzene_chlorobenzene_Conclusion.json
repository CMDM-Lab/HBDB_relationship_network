    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is highlighted as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that the PTA thin films/K+-exchanged OWGs sensor is specifically designed to detect. The sensor demonstrates a high sensitivity and a low detection limit for chlorobenzene gas, indicating its effectiveness in monitoring this compound in various applications, particularly in environmental and industrial settings. The repeated mention of chlorobenzene emphasizes its significance in the study."
