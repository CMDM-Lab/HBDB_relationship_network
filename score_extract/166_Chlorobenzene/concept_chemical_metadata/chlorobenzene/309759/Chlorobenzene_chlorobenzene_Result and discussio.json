    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a specific aromatic hydrocarbon gas that the PTA film/K+-exchanged glass OWG sensor responds to. The study highlights that the sensor exhibits a stronger response to chlorobenzene compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, toluene, and xylene. This indicates a focused investigation on chlorobenzene's detection capabilities using the sensor technology."
