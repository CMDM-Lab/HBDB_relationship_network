    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned multiple times as a gas being detected and analyzed using a commercial gas detection tube. The study focuses on the concentration and performance of a sensor device in detecting chlorobenzene gas, highlighting its properties and interactions with the sensor material. The repeated mention of chlorobenzene indicates a clear focus on its detection and measurement, but there is no discussion of different forms or types of chlorobenzene, as both terms refer to the same compound."
