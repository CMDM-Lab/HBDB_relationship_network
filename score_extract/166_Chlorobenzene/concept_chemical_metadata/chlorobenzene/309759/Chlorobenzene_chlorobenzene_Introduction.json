    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a target gas for detection using a sensitive and reusable gas sensor developed from PTA thin film. The study focuses on the sensor's response to chlorobenzene at parts per million levels, indicating its significance in monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The relationship is direct, as the sensor is specifically designed to detect chlorobenzene gas."
