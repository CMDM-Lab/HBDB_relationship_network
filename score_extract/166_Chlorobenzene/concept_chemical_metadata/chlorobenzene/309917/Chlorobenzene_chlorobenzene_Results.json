    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a chemical to which A549 cells were exposed. The study investigates the effects of chlorobenzene on the production of IL-13 in PBMC, with findings indicating that MCP-1 produced from chlorobenzene-exposed A549 cells plays a role in IL-13 induction. The relationship is direct, as chlorobenzene exposure is linked to the modulation of immune responses in PBMC through MCP-1 signaling."
