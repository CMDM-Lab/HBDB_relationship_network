    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed as a solvent that induces the production of inflammatory mediators, specifically MCP-1, in lung epithelial cells. This suggests a direct role of chlorobenzene in mediating inflammatory responses in the airways, which may contribute to allergic reactions. The mention of chlorobenzene in various industrial applications further emphasizes its relevance as a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with health risks."
