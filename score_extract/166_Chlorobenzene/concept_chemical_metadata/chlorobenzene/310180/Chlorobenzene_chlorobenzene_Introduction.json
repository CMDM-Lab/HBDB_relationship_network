    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its degradation pathways during pyrolytic processes. The study highlights that chlorobenzene undergoes similar degradation mechanisms as trichloroethylene (TCE) at millimolar concentrations, primarily through pyrolysis rather than radical-induced pathways. The detection of chlorophenols as intermediates further supports the specific degradation route of chlorobenzene under certain conditions, emphasizing its chemical behavior in environmental degradation studies."
