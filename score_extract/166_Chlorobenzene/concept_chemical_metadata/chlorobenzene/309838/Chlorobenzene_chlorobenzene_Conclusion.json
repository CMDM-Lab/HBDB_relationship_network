    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its thermal oxidation process and the behavior of residual chlorine in a catalyst during regeneration. The text highlights that chlorobenzene does not form coke deposits during oxidation, contrasting it with toluene. The focus is on the chemical properties and reactions of chlorobenzene, particularly in waste disposal methods, indicating its significance in environmental chemistry."
