    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as part of a methanolic stock solution used in experiments involving gas/fiber distribution coefficients and headspace sampling. The text does not differentiate between 'Chlorobenzene' and 'chlorobenzene', indicating they refer to the same compound. However, there is no discussion of its chemical properties, interactions, or relevance to the study's outcomes, leading to a lack of meaningful relationship between the terms."
