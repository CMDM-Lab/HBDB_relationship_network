    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its effects on human lung epithelial cells, particularly in the secretion of inflammatory mediators like MCP-1 and IL-8. The study highlights the role of chlorobenzene in inducing oxidative stress and upregulating COX-2, which is critical in respiratory inflammation and lung disease pathogenesis. The repeated mention of chlorobenzene emphasizes its significance in the inflammatory response and oxidative stress mechanisms in lung cells."
