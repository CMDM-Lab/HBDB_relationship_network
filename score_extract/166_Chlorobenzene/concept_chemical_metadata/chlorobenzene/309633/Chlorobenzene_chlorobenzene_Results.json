    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that, like styrene, can induce oxidative stress in A549 cells. The study highlights that exposure to chlorobenzene leads to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating a detrimental effect on cellular health. However, the specific effects of chlorobenzene are not detailed separately from those of other VOCs, limiting the depth of the relationship discussed."
