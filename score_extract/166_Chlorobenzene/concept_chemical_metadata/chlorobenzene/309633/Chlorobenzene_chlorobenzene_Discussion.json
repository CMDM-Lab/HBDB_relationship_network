    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed as an aromatic compound that induces the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in lung epithelial cells, which is linked to the expression of COX-2 and the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins. The study highlights chlorobenzene's role in oxidative stress and its potential impact on inflammatory responses, suggesting a significant biological relevance in the context of VOC-induced effects on cellular signaling pathways."
