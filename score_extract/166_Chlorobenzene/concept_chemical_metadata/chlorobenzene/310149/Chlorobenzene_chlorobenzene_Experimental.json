    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as one of the chemicals used as a chromatographic standard in the study. It is listed alongside other compounds like benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene, indicating its role in the experimental setup. However, there is no further discussion or analysis of its specific properties or interactions, making the mention of chlorobenzene somewhat incidental rather than indicative of a significant relationship."
