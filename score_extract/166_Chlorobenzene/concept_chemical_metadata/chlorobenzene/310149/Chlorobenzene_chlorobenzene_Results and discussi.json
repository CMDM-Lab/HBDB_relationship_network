    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its partition coefficients in different denudation traps. The analysis indicates that chlorobenzene exhibits varying partition coefficients depending on the type of stationary phase used in the denuder, highlighting its chemical behavior in analytical applications. However, the mention of chlorobenzene is consistent throughout, indicating it is the same compound being analyzed rather than a relationship between two distinct entities."
