    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption properties on coconut shell-derived carbon (CDC) compared to commercial activated carbon. The text highlights that chlorobenzene's larger molecular mass contributes to its adsorption potential, indicating a focus on its physical and chemical characteristics in adsorption studies. However, the term 'chlorobenzene' is mentioned twice, suggesting redundancy rather than a distinct relationship with another term."
