    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption potential compared to other compounds. The text highlights that chlorobenzene, due to its chlorine substitution, exhibits greater polarization and stronger interaction potential with adsorbents than benzene. This suggests that chlorobenzene's chemical structure significantly influences its adsorption characteristics, making it more readily adsorbed by CDC compared to other VOCs."
