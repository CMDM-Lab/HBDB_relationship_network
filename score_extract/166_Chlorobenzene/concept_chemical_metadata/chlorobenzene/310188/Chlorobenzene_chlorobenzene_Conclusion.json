    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption properties on adsorbents, particularly in comparison to toluene. The text highlights that chlorobenzene exhibits a greater affinity for adsorption due to its more polarized electrons, which enhance interactions with adsorbents. This indicates a significant role of chlorobenzene in studies of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their impact on indoor air quality."
