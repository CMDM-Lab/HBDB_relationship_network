    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption characteristics compared to toluene within a simulation study. The results indicate that chlorobenzene is adsorbed more easily than toluene on CDC and CAC adsorbents, as evidenced by its shorter breakthrough time and higher dynamic adsorption capacity. This highlights the specific interaction and comparative behavior of chlorobenzene in adsorption processes."
