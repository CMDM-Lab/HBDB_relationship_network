    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as a less studied species compared to benzene in the modeling of chemical processes within a lab-scale flow reactor designed to simulate conditions found in large-scale incinerators. The focus is on the comparison of data between these two compounds, indicating that chlorobenzene is part of the broader analysis of combustion products, but no specific interactions or detailed relationships are discussed."
