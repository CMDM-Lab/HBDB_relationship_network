    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is examined in relation to its oxidation reactions, with a focus on comparing its behavior to that of benzene. The study utilizes flow reactor experiments to analyze the reaction pathways and decomposition products of chlorobenzene, validating chemical kinetic models based on the experimental data. The relationship is primarily centered on the chemical properties and reaction mechanisms of chlorobenzene as an analog to benzene."
