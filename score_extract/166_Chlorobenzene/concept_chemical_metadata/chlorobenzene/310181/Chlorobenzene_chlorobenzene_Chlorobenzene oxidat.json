    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its chemical reactions, particularly its destruction pathways involving oxygen and hydroxyl radicals. The text highlights the similarities in chemistry between chlorobenzene and benzene, indicating that chlorobenzene undergoes chain branching and propagation reactions during combustion. The focus is on the efficiency of chlorobenzene destruction at low temperatures, with references to reaction rates and products formed, such as chlorophenol."
