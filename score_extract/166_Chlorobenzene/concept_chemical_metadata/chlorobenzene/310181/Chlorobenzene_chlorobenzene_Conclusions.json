    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its chemical behavior and environmental impact, particularly regarding its oxidation and the formation of toxic byproducts. The text highlights the complexity of chlorobenzene's reactions due to its reduced symmetry and the presence of chlorinated isomers, indicating its significance in environmental pollution and human health issues. However, the term 'chlorobenzene' is used consistently without introducing new information or distinct interactions, suggesting a focus on the same compound rather than a relationship between two different entities."
