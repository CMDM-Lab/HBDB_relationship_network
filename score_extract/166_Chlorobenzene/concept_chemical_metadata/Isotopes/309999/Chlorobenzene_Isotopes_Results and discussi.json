    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in relation to calibration curves and isotopic effects on carbon isotopes. However, the discussion does not provide a direct relationship between chlorobenzene and isotopes, as it primarily focuses on the calibration and selectivity of various compounds without detailing how chlorobenzene specifically interacts with isotopes or their effects."
