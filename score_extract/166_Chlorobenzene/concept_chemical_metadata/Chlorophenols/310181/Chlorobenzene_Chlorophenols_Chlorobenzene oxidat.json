    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and chlorophenols are related through their chemical reactions and mechanisms. Chlorobenzene can undergo hydrogen abstraction to form chlorophenyl radicals, which can lead to the formation of various chlorophenol isomers. The study discusses the complexity of these reactions and includes multiple literature sources that describe the interactions between chlorobenzene and chlorophenols, indicating a significant relationship in their chemical behavior and transformation pathways."
