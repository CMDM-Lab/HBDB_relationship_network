    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and dichloropropane are both mentioned as components of a methanolic stock solution used in experiments to analyze their behavior in a gas/fiber distribution system. However, there is no detailed discussion of their interactions or specific relationships beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup, indicating they are treated as separate entities in the study."
