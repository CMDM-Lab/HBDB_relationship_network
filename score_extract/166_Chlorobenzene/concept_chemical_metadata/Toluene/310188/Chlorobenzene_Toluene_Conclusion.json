    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) discussed in relation to their adsorption characteristics on adsorbents derived from coconut shell. The study indicates that chlorobenzene exhibits a greater affinity for adsorption compared to toluene due to its more polarized electrons, which enhance the interaction with the adsorbent. This suggests a significant difference in their behavior during adsorption processes, highlighting their relevance in the context of air quality and pollutant removal."
