    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are compared regarding their adsorption processes on a specific carbon adsorbent (CDC). The study indicates that chlorobenzene adsorbs more readily than toluene, as evidenced by the adsorption isotherm analysis. The findings suggest that the structural properties of the adsorbent influence the adsorption efficiency of these two volatile organic compounds, highlighting their differing behaviors in adsorption dynamics."
