    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are compared in terms of their adsorption characteristics, specifically their Henry's law constants (K_H) at 298 K. The data indicates that chlorobenzene has a significantly higher K_H value than toluene, suggesting that chlorobenzene is adsorbed more strongly than toluene under the specified conditions. Both compounds share a common structural feature, the benzene ring, but differ in their substituent groups, which influences their adsorption behavior."
