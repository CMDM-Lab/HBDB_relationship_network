    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both evaluated for their adsorption performance on activated carbon derived from coconut shells. The study investigates the adsorption mechanisms and compares the physicochemical properties of the adsorbents in relation to their ability to adsorb these two volatile organic compounds. While both compounds are analyzed together, the specific interactions or differences in their adsorption characteristics are not deeply explored."
