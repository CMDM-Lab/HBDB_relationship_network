    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both analyzed for their adsorption behaviors on CDC and CAC adsorbents using GCMC simulation. The study indicates that chlorobenzene is adsorbed more easily than toluene, as evidenced by its shorter breakthrough time and higher dynamic adsorption capacity. This suggests a competitive relationship in terms of adsorption efficiency on the same materials."
