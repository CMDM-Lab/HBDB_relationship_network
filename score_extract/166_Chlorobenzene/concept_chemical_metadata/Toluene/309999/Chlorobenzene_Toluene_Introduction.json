    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are common contaminants in groundwater and are associated with high toxicity. While the study focuses on chlorobenzene's role in mediating inflammatory reactions and allergic reactivity, toluene is mentioned alongside it as part of a broader examination of VOCs. However, their specific interactions or comparative effects are not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship."
