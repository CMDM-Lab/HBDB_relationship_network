    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as compounds analyzed for their isotopic composition in a study involving contaminated groundwater. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework. They are treated as separate entities within the context of compound-specific analysis, lacking direct interaction or comparative significance."
