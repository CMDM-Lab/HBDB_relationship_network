    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as compounds used in isotopic analyses and standard solution preparations. They are part of a broader study involving various organic solvents, but there is no specific discussion of their chemical interactions or functional relationships. Their mention is primarily related to their roles as analytical standards rather than any direct connection."
