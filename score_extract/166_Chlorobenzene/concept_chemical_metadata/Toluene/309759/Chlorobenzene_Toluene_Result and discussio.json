    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both aromatic hydrocarbons that are evaluated for their responses to a specific optical waveguide sensor. The study highlights that the sensor exhibits a stronger response to chlorobenzene compared to toluene and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While both compounds are mentioned together in the context of sensor response, the focus is primarily on chlorobenzene's interaction with the sensor rather than a direct comparison or relationship between the two compounds."
