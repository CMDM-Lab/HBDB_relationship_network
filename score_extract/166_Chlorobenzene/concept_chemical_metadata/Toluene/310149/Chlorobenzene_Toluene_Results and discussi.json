    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both analyzed as components of a gaseous standard mixture in a study focused on their adsorption characteristics. The partition coefficients for these compounds, along with others like benzene and ethylbenzene, are calculated to understand their behavior in a stationary phase during gas chromatography. However, the relationship between chlorobenzene and toluene is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework."
