    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of a methanolic stock solution used in gas chromatography experiments. They are analyzed in relation to their distribution coefficients and behavior in a closed two-phase system. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup."
