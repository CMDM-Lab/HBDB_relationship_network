    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned as one of the chemicals used as a chromatographic standard in experiments involving denudation traps and equilibrium sorption methods. It is grouped with other volatile organic compounds like benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene, indicating its role as a chemical analyte in chromatographic processes. However, there is no detailed discussion of its specific properties or interactions beyond its classification as a chemical standard."
