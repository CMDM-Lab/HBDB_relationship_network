    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as an aromatic compound that induces the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway in lung epithelial cells. This activation is linked to the regulation of COX-2 expression and subsequent production of inflammatory mediators, highlighting chlorobenzene's role as a specific example of how aromatic compounds can influence biological processes related to oxidative stress and inflammation."
