    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned in relation to a carbon balance analysis, indicating its contribution to the total carbon in a combustion system. The text notes that chlorobenzene accounts for only 4% of the total carbon, while CO2 represents approximately 8% of the combustion products. However, there is no detailed discussion of the chemical interactions or specific relevance of chlorobenzene to carbon beyond this quantitative observation."
