    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is analyzed in relation to its conversion within a reactor, where the carbon material balance is monitored based on the amount of chlorobenzene converted and the carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) produced. This indicates a direct relationship between chlorobenzene and carbon, as the conversion process involves tracking carbon atoms through the reaction products formed during chlorobenzene degradation."
