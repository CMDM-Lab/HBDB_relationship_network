    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption performance on carbon materials, specifically coconut shell-derived carbon (CDC) and commercial activated carbon (CAC). The study highlights that the structural properties of carbon, such as pore size and surface characteristics, significantly influence the adsorption capacity for chlorobenzene. The comparison indicates that CDC has better adsorption potential for chlorobenzene due to its suitable micropore structure, which enhances interactions with aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
