    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as a specific type of organic chemical, particularly a volatile organic compound (VOC). The study focuses on the response of a sensor to chlorobenzene gas compared to other organic chemicals like benzene, toluene, and xylene. The findings highlight chlorobenzene's distinct detection characteristics, emphasizing its relevance within the broader category of organic chemicals, particularly in sensing applications."
