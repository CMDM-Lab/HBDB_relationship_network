    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption performance on coconut shell-derived carbon (CDC) compared to commercial activated carbon (CAC). The presence of carbonyl groups in CAC is noted to weaken the interactions between the adsorbent and chlorobenzene due to reduced surface electron density. This suggests that the carbonyl group negatively impacts the adsorption capacity of chlorobenzene, highlighting a significant relationship between the two terms in the context of adsorption efficiency."
