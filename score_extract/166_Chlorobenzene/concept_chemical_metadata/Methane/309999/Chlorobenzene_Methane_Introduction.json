    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and methane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can contaminate groundwater. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed. Chlorobenzene is highlighted for its role in mediating inflammatory reactions and allergic reactivity, while methane is not directly linked to these effects. Their mention together suggests they are part of a broader category of environmental contaminants, but no specific interaction or comparative analysis is provided."
