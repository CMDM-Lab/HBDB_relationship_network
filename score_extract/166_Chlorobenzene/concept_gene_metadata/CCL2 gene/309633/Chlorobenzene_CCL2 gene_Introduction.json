    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to the expression of inflammatory mediators in lung epithelial cells, which may involve the CCL2 gene (also known as MCP-1). Exposure to chlorobenzene correlates with increased secretion of MCP-1, a key factor in recruiting inflammatory cells in lung inflammation. The study suggests that chlorobenzene exposure induces oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways that could influence CCL2 expression, highlighting a potential relationship between chlorobenzene and the CCL2 gene in the context of lung inflammation."
