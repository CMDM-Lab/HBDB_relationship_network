    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to the CCL2 gene through its role in inducing a Th2 immune response, which is characterized by the production of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. The study indicates that exposure to chlorobenzene enhances the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including MCP-1, which is associated with the activation of the CCL2 gene. This suggests that chlorobenzene exposure may contribute to allergic sensitization and Th2 primed T-cell immunity, highlighting a significant relationship between chlorobenzene and the CCL2 gene in the context of inflammatory responses."
