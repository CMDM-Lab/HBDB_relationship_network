    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to the CCL2 gene through its role in the production of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) by A549 cells. The study indicates that chlorobenzene exposure leads to MCP-1 production, which subsequently influences IL-13 induction in PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). The inhibition of IL-13 production by an anti-MCP-1 antibody suggests a significant interaction between chlorobenzene exposure and the CCL2 gene's role in inflammatory responses."
