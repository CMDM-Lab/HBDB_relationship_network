    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to the CCL2 gene through its role in inducing the production of inflammatory mediators, specifically MCP-1, in lung epithelial cells. The release of MCP-1, a chemokine encoded by the CCL2 gene, suggests that chlorobenzene exposure may contribute to inflammatory responses and allergic reactivity in the airways, highlighting a potential mechanism by which chlorobenzene affects immune function and inflammation."
