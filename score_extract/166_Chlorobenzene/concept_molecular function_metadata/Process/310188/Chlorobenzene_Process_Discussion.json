    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is compared to toluene in terms of their adsorption processes on a carbonaceous material (CDC). The study highlights that chlorobenzene adsorption is more favorable than toluene, indicating a specific relationship between the chemical properties of chlorobenzene and the adsorption process. The analysis involves theoretical calculations and model fits to understand the adsorption behavior, suggesting a significant connection between chlorobenzene and the adsorption process being investigated."
