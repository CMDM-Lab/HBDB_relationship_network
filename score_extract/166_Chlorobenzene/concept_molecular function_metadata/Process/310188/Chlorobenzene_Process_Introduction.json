    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene (CB) is discussed in relation to its degradation processes, particularly through pyrolysis and reactions with hydroxyl (OH) radicals. The mention of CB as a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from chemical processes highlights its significance in industrial emissions and environmental health. The context emphasizes the need for analytical methodologies to study its degradation, indicating that chlorobenzene is closely tied to various chemical processes that impact air quality and human health."
