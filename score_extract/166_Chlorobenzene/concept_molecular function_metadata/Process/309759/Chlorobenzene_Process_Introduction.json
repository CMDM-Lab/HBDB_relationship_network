    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is directly related to the process of developing a gas sensor based on PTA thin film immobilized on K+-exchanged glass. The preparation and characterization of the sensor involve specific fabrication processes that utilize chlorobenzene as a target volatile organic compound (VOC) for detection. The detailed description of the sensor's fabrication process highlights the significance of chlorobenzene in the context of sensor technology."
