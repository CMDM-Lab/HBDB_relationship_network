    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is mentioned alongside various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in relation to calibration curves and analyte selectivity during a testing process. However, there is no specific discussion about chlorobenzene's role or interaction within the described process, making its relevance to the overall methodology unclear. The focus is more on the calibration and competition processes involving multiple compounds rather than a direct relationship with chlorobenzene."
