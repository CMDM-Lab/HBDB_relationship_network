    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to a biological process involving the modulation of functional activity in human lung epithelial cells, specifically enhancing the production of MCP-1 and IL-8. The process by which chlorobenzene induces these effects is not fully understood, but it is suggested that reactive metabolites may interact with critical cellular components, such as glutathione. This indicates a significant biological process influenced by chlorobenzene, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear."
