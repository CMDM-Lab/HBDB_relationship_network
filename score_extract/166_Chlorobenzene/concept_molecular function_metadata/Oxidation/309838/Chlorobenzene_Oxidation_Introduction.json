    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is investigated as a model compound for oxidation reactions using a manganese/copper mixed oxide catalyst supported on TiO2. The study focuses on the catalytic activity for chlorobenzene conversion, the distribution of reaction products, and the catalyst's performance, indicating a direct relationship between chlorobenzene and oxidation processes. The optimization of the catalyst is aimed at enhancing the oxidation efficiency of chlorobenzene, highlighting its significance in the study of catalytic oxidation reactions."
