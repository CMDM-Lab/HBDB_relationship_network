    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its oxidation process, particularly in the context of waste disposal methods. The text highlights that chlorobenzene undergoes thermal oxidation, resulting in the formation of water, carbon dioxide, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Unlike toluene, chlorobenzene does not produce coke deposits during oxidation, indicating a distinct behavior in its oxidative degradation. This suggests a significant relationship between chlorobenzene and oxidation processes in waste management."
