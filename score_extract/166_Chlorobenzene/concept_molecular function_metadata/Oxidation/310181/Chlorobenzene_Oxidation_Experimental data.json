    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is examined in relation to its oxidation process within a flow reactor. The study focuses on the reaction pathways and intermediate species formed during the oxidation of chlorobenzene when subjected to high temperatures and specific conditions. The experimental setup aims to validate chemical kinetic models by analyzing the decomposition products resulting from chlorobenzene oxidation, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its oxidation reactions."
