    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its oxidation pathways, which are suggested to be similar to those of benzene. The study emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the reaction mechanisms involved in the oxidation of chlorobenzene, particularly regarding the formation of chlorinated byproducts. This indicates a direct relationship between chlorobenzene and oxidation processes, highlighting the importance of oxidation in its chemical behavior and transformation."
