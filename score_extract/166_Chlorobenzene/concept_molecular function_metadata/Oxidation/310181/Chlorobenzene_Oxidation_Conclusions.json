    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes, particularly under moderate temperatures and oxygen-rich conditions. The oxidation of chlorobenzene primarily leads to the formation of chlorinated byproducts rather than the expected simpler products, indicating that the oxidation of chlorobenzene is complex and results in potentially more toxic compounds. This highlights the significance of oxidation reactions in determining the environmental impact and toxicity of chlorobenzene as a volatile organic compound (VOC)."
