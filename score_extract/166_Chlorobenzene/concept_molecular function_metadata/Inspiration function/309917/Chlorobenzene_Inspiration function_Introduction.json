    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to respiratory function through its inhalation effects, which include irritation of the respiratory tract and potential toxicity to lung tissues. The mention of drowsiness and lack of coordination suggests that chlorobenzene exposure can impair overall respiratory function, although the specific impact on inspiration function is not directly detailed. The study also highlights the inflammatory and immuno-modulatory effects of chlorobenzene on lung cells, indicating a broader concern for respiratory health."
