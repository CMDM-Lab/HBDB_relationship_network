    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to inflammation through its ability to induce the production of inflammatory mediators, specifically MCP-1, in lung epithelial cells. This release may lead to Th2 differentiation in T lymphocytes, suggesting that chlorobenzene plays a role in the development of inflammatory reactions in the airways, potentially contributing to allergic reactivity. The findings highlight chlorobenzene's impact on inflammatory processes, particularly in respiratory health."
