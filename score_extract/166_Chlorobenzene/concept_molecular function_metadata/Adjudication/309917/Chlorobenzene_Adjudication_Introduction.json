    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its potential immuno-modulatory effects and allergic sensitization, particularly in children. However, the term 'adjudication' is not directly addressed or linked to chlorobenzene's effects or the study's findings. The relationship between the two terms is not established, as adjudication typically refers to a legal process rather than a biological or chemical interaction."
