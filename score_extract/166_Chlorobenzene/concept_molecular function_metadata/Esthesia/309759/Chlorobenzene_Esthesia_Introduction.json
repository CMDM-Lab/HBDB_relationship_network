    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as a hazardous volatile organic compound (VOC) with significant health risks, including acute toxicity. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of esthesia, which typically refers to sensation or perception, particularly in a medical context. The relationship between chlorobenzene and esthesia is not established, as the focus is primarily on the environmental and health impacts of chlorobenzene exposure without linking it to sensory effects."
