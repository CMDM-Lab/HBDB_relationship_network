    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as one of the analytes whose partition coefficients are calculated during an experiment involving gas chromatography. The relationship is established through the measurement of chlorobenzene's concentration in the gas stream and its equilibrium state in the stationary phase, indicating its role as a target analyte in the study of sorption dynamics. However, the context does not elaborate on specific interactions or implications of chlorobenzene beyond its identification as an analyte."
