    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is identified as one of the analytes studied for its sorption properties using denudation traps in air sampling. The research focuses on the partition coefficients of various analytes, including chlorobenzene, which are essential for determining their concentrations in samples. The study emphasizes the relationship between the analyte's properties and the efficiency of different stationary phases in capturing these compounds, highlighting chlorobenzene's role in the broader analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
