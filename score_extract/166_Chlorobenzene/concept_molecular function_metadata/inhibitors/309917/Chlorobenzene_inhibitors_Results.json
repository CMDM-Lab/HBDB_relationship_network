    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is evaluated for its effects on cell vitality and cytokine production in PBMC and A549 cells. The results indicate that chlorobenzene does not exhibit significant stimulating or inhibitory effects on cell vitality. However, methanol, used as a diluent for chlorobenzene, significantly inhibited IL-8 release in A549 cells and reduced TNF-Î± production in PBMC. While chlorobenzene itself is not directly linked to inhibition, the context suggests that the presence of inhibitors (like methanol) can affect cytokine production in the studied cells."
