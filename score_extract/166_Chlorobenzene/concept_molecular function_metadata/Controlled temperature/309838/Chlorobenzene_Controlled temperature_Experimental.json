    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene (CB) is introduced into a reactor at a controlled temperature to facilitate catalytic tests. The temperature is crucial for regulating the concentration of chlorobenzene in the air flow, as it is fed through a saturator. This indicates a direct relationship where controlled temperature is essential for maintaining the desired concentration of chlorobenzene during the experiment."
