    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to immunological dysfunctions, including disturbed phagocytic activity and allergic sensitizations, particularly in children. The study highlights the potential immuno-modulatory effects of chlorobenzene exposure, suggesting that it may influence T cell immunity and provoke inflammatory responses in lung epithelial and blood cells. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear."
