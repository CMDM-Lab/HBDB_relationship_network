    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to immune responses, particularly through its role in promoting a Th2 phenotype in lung cells. Exposure to chlorobenzene increases MCP-1 levels, which triggers Th2 immune responses characterized by the production of cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. These cytokines are associated with IgE-mediated allergic reactions, indicating that chlorobenzene exposure may contribute to allergic sensitization and altered immune function, particularly in children."
