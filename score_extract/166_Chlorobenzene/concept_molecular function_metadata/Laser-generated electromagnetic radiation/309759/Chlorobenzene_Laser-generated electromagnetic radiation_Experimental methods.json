    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is used as a gas to test the response of a sensing membrane immobilized on K+-exchanged glass, while laser-generated electromagnetic radiation, specifically from a Heâ€“Ne laser, is employed in the experimental setup to measure the absorbance changes of the thin film. The relationship is primarily functional, as the laser facilitates the measurement of the thin film's response to chlorobenzene exposure, but there is no direct interaction between the two substances beyond this experimental application."
