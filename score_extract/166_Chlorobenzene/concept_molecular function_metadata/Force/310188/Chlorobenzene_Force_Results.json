    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption characteristics, specifically highlighting its stronger binding force compared to toluene on CDC. The isosteric heat of adsorption (q st) is mentioned as a key parameter to explore intermolecular forces, indicating that chlorobenzene exhibits a higher q st, which signifies a greater force of interaction with the adsorbent material. This suggests a significant relationship between chlorobenzene and the concept of force in terms of adsorption strength."
