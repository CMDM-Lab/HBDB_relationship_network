    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene and toluene oxidation are discussed in relation to their thermal oxidation processes. The text highlights that during toluene oxidation, coke deposits are formed, whereas no such deposits occur during chlorobenzene oxidation. This indicates a difference in the oxidation behavior of these two compounds, suggesting that chlorobenzene may be more favorable for certain waste disposal methods due to its lack of coke formation."
