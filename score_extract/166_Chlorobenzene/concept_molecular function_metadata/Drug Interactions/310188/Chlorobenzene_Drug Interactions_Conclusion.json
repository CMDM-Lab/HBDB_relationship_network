    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is discussed primarily in relation to its adsorption properties as a volatile organic compound (VOC) and its interactions with adsorbents. While chlorobenzene is noted for its greater affinity for certain adsorbents compared to toluene, there is no direct mention of drug interactions or any specific relationship between chlorobenzene and drug interactions. The focus remains on its environmental impact and health concerns related to VOC exposure rather than pharmacological interactions."
