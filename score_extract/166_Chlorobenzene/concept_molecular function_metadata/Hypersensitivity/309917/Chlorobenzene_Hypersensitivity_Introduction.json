    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to hypersensitivity through its potential to cause allergic sensitizations and Th2 primed T cell immunity in children, as indicated by an epidemiological study. The inhalation of chlorobenzene is associated with respiratory irritations and cytotoxic effects on lung epithelial cells, suggesting a role in immune modulation and hypersensitivity reactions. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear, warranting further investigation into its inflammatory effects."
