    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is investigated as a model compound for oxidation reactions using a manganese/copper mixed oxide catalyst supported on TiO2. The study focuses on the catalyst's activity in converting chlorobenzene, analyzing the distribution of reaction products, and addressing issues of catalyst deactivation and regeneration. This indicates a direct relationship where the catalyst's performance is critical for the oxidation of chlorobenzene."
