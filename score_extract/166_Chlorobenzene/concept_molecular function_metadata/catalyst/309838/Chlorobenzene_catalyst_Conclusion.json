    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene (CB) is being oxidized using a catalyst composed of MnCuO x /T, which exhibits high catalytic activity due to the presence of a specific spinel phase. The study discusses the catalyst's performance and the formation of oxychlorinated species on its surface during the reaction, indicating a direct relationship between chlorobenzene and the catalyst's activity and stability. The catalyst's partial deactivation due to chlorine presence is noted, but it continues to function effectively, highlighting the importance of the catalyst in the oxidation process of chlorobenzene."
