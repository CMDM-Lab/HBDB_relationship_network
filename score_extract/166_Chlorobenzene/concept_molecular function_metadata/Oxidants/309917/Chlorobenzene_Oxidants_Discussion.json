    "summary": "In this context, chlorobenzene is linked to the production of inflammatory mediators in A549 lung cells, potentially through its interaction with oxidants. The depletion of glutathione (GSH), an important antioxidant, suggests that chlorobenzene may enhance oxidative stress, leading to increased IL-8 and MCP-1 production. This indicates a significant relationship between chlorobenzene and oxidants, as the reduction in GSH levels is associated with inflammatory responses mediated by oxidative mechanisms."
