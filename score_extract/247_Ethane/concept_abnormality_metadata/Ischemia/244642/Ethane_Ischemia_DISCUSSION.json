    "summary": "In this context, ethane is linked to ischemia through its role as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation resulting from ischemia and reperfusion injury during surgical procedures. The study indicates that ethane levels can reflect lipid damage associated with prolonged ischemic conditions, suggesting that monitoring ethane may provide insights into the extent of ischemic injury during surgery."
