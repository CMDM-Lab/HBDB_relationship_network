    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in patients, including those with respiratory disorders. However, the study indicates that ethane levels in lung cancer patients did not significantly differ from those in healthy controls or patients with other respiratory diseases. This suggests that while ethane may be related to OS, its utility in diagnosing specific respiratory disorders is limited."
