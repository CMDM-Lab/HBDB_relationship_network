    "summary": "In this context, ethane is highlighted as a potential breath biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) associated with respiratory disorders, particularly lung cancer. Increased ethane exhalation has been observed in patients with respiratory diseases and airway inflammation, suggesting a direct link between elevated ethane levels and respiratory disorders. The study emphasizes the significance of ethane as a volatile organic compound (VOC) in breath analysis for diagnosing and monitoring respiratory conditions."
