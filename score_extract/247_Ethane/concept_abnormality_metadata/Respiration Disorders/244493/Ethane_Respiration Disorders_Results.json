    "summary": "In this context, ethane is measured in the exhalation of subjects, including lung cancer patients and individuals with respiratory disorders. However, the study finds no significant differences in ethane levels between control subjects and those with respiratory issues or lung cancer. This suggests that ethane exhalation may not be a reliable biomarker for respiratory disorders, indicating a weak relationship between ethane and these conditions."
