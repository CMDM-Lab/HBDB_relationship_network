    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath and the potential contamination of samples from patients with obstructive lung diseases. The study highlights that patients may trap ambient air containing ethane, which complicates the quantification of exhaled ethane. The severity of lung obstruction increases the risk of sample contamination, indicating a connection between ethane levels and the challenges in assessing lung function in obstructive lung diseases."
