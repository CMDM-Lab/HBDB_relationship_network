    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its measurement in exhaled breath as a potential biomarker for assessing physiological changes during surgical procedures. However, the term 'adjudication' appears unrelated to ethane's biochemical role or its measurement, as it typically refers to a legal or decision-making process. Thus, there is no direct relationship between ethane and adjudication in this context."
