    "summary": "In this context, ethane is mentioned as a compound analyzed in exhaled breath samples collected during a surgical procedure, while adjudication is not directly referenced in relation to ethane. The focus is on the measurement of ethane levels as a potential biomarker, but there is no discussion of adjudication or its relevance to the study. Thus, the two terms appear unrelated within the provided context."
