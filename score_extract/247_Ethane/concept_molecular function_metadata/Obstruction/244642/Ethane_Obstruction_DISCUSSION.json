    "summary": "In this context, ethane is mentioned in relation to free radical damage and lipid peroxidation during the reperfusion of ischemic tissues, particularly in the setting of aortic repair. However, there is no direct mention of obstruction or its specific relationship to ethane. The discussion focuses on ethane as a potential marker for oxidative stress rather than its connection to obstruction, making the relationship unclear."
