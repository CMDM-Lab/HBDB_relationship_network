    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to obstructive lung disease, where patients may trap ambient air containing ethane, leading to potential contamination of exhaled samples. The severity of obstruction increases the risk of this contamination, necessitating careful sampling methods to ensure accurate measurement of ethane levels in breath analysis. Thus, ethane's presence is influenced by the degree of airway obstruction in patients."
