    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a biomarker of oxidative stress related to lung function in smokers. The study indicates that exhaled ethane levels correlate negatively with lung function measures, suggesting that higher ethane levels may reflect greater oxidative damage in the respiratory system. The administration of vitamin E appears to influence these levels, indicating a potential link between ethane and respiratory physiology, particularly in the context of lung health and disease progression in smokers."
