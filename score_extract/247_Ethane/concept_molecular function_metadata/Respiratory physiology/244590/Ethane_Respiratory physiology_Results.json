    "summary": "In this context, ethane is examined as a potential biomarker related to respiratory physiology, specifically lung function as measured by FEV1/FVC ratios. The study indicates a significant negative association between exhaled ethane levels and lung function, particularly after vitamin E intake, suggesting that increased lipid peroxidation, possibly linked to smoking, may adversely affect respiratory health. However, the relationship lacks consistent statistical significance across all measurements, indicating a complex interaction that warrants further investigation."
