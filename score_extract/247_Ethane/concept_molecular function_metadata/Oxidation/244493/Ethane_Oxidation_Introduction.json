    "summary": "In this context, ethane is produced in vivo through the oxidation of cell membrane lipids, which is a result of free-radical-mediated damage. This process indicates that ethane levels can reflect oxidative stress in the body. The relationship highlights how oxidative processes contribute to the production of ethane, linking it to potential lung injury and disease pathogenesis."
