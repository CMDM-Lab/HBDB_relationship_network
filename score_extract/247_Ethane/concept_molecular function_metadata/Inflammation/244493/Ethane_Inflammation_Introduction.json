    "summary": "In this context, ethane is linked to inflammation through its role as a biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) resulting from lipid peroxidation. Increased ethane exhalation has been observed in patients with respiratory diseases and airway inflammation, suggesting that elevated levels of ethane in breath may indicate underlying inflammatory processes associated with conditions like lung cancer. The study highlights ethane's potential as a noninvasive indicator of inflammation and oxidative damage in lung tissue."
