    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a volatile organic compound exhaled by individuals, with its levels being negatively associated with lung function parameters such as FEV1/FVC. The study suggests that increased exhalation of ethane may indicate heightened lipid peroxidation, particularly in smokers, linking ethane levels to respiratory health. However, the statistical significance of these associations varies, particularly after vitamin E intake, indicating a complex relationship between ethane exhalation and lung function."
