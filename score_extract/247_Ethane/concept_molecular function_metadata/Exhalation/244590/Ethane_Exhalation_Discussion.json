    "summary": "In this context, exhaled ethane is associated with oxidant load and lung function. The study indicates that higher levels of exhaled ethane correlate negatively with lung function, suggesting that ethane may serve as a biomarker for oxidative stress in the lungs. The administration of vitamin E appears to influence exhaled ethane levels, with better lung function observed in subjects showing significant reductions in ethane after treatment. This highlights the relevance of exhaled ethane in assessing lung health and oxidative damage."
