    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a component of exhaled breath samples collected from subjects following a standardized protocol. The concentration of ethane in exhalation is determined by comparing the sample concentration to a background sample, ensuring accurate measurement of ethane levels in breath. This highlights the relationship between ethane and the process of exhalation, as ethane is specifically measured in the breath to assess its concentration and potential significance in physiological studies."
