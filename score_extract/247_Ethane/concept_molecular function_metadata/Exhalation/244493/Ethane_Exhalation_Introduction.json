    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a component of exhaled breath samples, specifically in relation to assessing oxidative stress (OS) in medical evaluations. The study highlights the use of a novel laser spectrometer for real-time measurement of ethane levels in breath, aiming to explore its association with lung cancer. This indicates a direct relevance of ethane to the process of exhalation, as it is a volatile organic compound measured in breath samples for clinical purposes."
