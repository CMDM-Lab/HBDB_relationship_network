    "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a potential real-time biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) that can be measured through exhalation. The study highlights the ability to detect ethane levels in breath samples, although it concludes that exhaled ethane is not significantly different in lung cancer patients compared to controls. This suggests that while ethane can be exhaled and measured, its utility as a diagnostic marker for lung cancer is limited."
