    "summary": "In this context, ethane is measured in exhaled breath during a surgical procedure, indicating its presence as a volatile organic compound released from the body. The study highlights the levels of ethane detected at various time points, particularly noting a significant increase after reperfusion compared to baseline levels. This suggests a potential relationship between ethane exhalation and physiological changes during surgery, possibly linked to oxidative stress or tissue injury."
