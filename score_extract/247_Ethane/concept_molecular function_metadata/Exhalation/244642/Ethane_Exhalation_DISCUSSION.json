    "summary": "In this context, ethane is mentioned as a compound that can be measured in exhaled breath, particularly in relation to assessing free radical damage during clinical procedures like aortic repair. The study suggests that exhaled ethane may serve as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, indicating its relevance in monitoring physiological processes related to ischemic damage and reperfusion injury."
