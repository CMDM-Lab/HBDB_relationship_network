    "summary": "In this context, ethane is measured in exhaled breath as a marker of oxidative stress following surgical procedures. The study reports statistically significant increases in ethane levels in exhalation at specific time points after reperfusion compared to baseline levels. This suggests that ethane exhalation may serve as a noninvasive indicator of metabolic changes related to surgical stress and tissue integrity."
