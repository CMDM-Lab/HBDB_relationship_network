    "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS), which is closely linked to lipid peroxidation. Ethane is produced in vivo as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, making it a relevant indicator of oxidative damage in lung cancer patients. The study highlights the association between increased ethane exhalation and conditions characterized by elevated lipid peroxidation, suggesting a direct relationship between the two in the context of respiratory diseases and cancer."
