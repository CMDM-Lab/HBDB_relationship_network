    "summary": "In this context, ethane is highlighted as a noninvasive marker for lipid peroxidation, which is a process that can lead to cellular damage. The authors prefer ethane over pentane for measuring lipid peroxidation due to its more rapid metabolism. This suggests a direct relationship where ethane serves as an indicator of lipid peroxidation levels, particularly in studies involving oxidative stress and respiratory health."
