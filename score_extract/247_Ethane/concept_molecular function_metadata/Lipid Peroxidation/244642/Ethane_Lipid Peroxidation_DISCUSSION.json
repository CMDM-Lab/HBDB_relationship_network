    "summary": "In this context, ethane is presented as a byproduct of lipid peroxidation, which occurs during ischemia and reperfusion injury. The study indicates that the levels of ethane detected correlate with the extent of lipid damage caused by reperfusion, suggesting that ethane can serve as a marker for lipid peroxidation. The absence of ethane changes in one case implies minimal lipid peroxidation, while its presence in others indicates significant lipid damage associated with longer cross-clamping times during surgery."
