    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in breath analysis, while noise refers to extraneous factors that may interfere with the accuracy of breath analysis results. The text suggests that noise can limit the diagnostic applications of ethane as a reliable indicator of OS, indicating that while ethane shows promise, its effectiveness may be compromised by noise factors that are difficult to control in clinical settings."
