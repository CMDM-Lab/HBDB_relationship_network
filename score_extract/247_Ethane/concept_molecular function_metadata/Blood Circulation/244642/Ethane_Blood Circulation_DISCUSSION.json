    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to its presence in exhaled breath as a marker for its appearance in the bloodstream. The study indicates that ethane injected into the portal system can be quantitatively retrieved in breath samples, suggesting a direct relationship between ethane levels in the blood and its detection in exhaled air. This connection highlights the potential of ethane as a biomarker for assessing blood circulation and metabolic processes in clinical settings."
