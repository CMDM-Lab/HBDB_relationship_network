    "summary": "In this context, ethane is associated with oxidant load, as indicated by the correlation between exhaled ethane levels and oxidative stress. The study suggests that higher oxidant levels correspond to increased exhaled ethane, which negatively impacts lung function. Additionally, vitamin E's limited effect on reducing exhaled ethane implies a complex relationship between antioxidants and oxidant levels in the context of lung health."
