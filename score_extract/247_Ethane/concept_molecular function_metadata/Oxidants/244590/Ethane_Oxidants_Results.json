    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as a biomarker of oxidative stress, with its exhaled levels positively associated with oxidant load. The study highlights that after vitamin E treatment, the correlation between oxidants and exhaled ethane became statistically significant, suggesting that oxidants may influence ethane production in the body. This relationship indicates that ethane could serve as an indicator of oxidative stress levels influenced by dietary antioxidants."
