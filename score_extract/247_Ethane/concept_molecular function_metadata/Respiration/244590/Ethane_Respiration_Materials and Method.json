    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed as part of a study on respiratory gas exchange. Subjects breathed hydrocarbon-free air, and the exhaled air was collected to measure ethane content. This indicates that ethane is being evaluated in relation to respiration, specifically how it is exhaled after inhalation of clean air, highlighting its presence in respiratory processes."
