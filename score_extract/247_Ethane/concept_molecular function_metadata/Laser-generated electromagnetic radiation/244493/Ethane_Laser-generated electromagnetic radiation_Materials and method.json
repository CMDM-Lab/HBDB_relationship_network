    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed using a spectroscopic technique that employs laser-generated electromagnetic radiation at a specific wavelength (3.4Î¼m) where ethane absorption transitions occur. The laser light passes through a sample cell to measure ethane concentrations in breath samples, demonstrating a direct application of laser technology in detecting ethane gas with high sensitivity and accuracy."
