    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed using laser-generated electromagnetic radiation for breath testing, specifically to assess oxidative stress (OS) in a non-invasive manner. The laser spectrometer's optical selectivity allows for sensitive detection of ethane, which is crucial for accurate breath analysis. The relationship is significant as the technology enables real-time monitoring of ethane levels in breath samples, highlighting its clinical relevance."
