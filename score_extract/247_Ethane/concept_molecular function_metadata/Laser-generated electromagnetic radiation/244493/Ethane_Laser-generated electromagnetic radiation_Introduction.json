    "summary": "In this context, ethane is analyzed using a novel laser spectrometer (Tunable Diode Laser Spectrometer, TDLS) for breath sample analysis, particularly in relation to assessing oxidative stress and its potential association with lung cancer. The laser-generated electromagnetic radiation from the TDLS allows for real-time, sensitive measurement of ethane levels in breath samples, highlighting the technological advancement in detecting this biomarker in clinical settings."
