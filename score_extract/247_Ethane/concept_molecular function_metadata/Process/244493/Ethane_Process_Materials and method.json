    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to the process of measuring its concentration using a spectroscopy system. The instrument's calibration against a known ethane standard and its validation against gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) highlight the importance of accurate measurement processes in breath analysis. The focus is on the technical process of ensuring reliable ethane detection rather than on ethane's biological or chemical implications."
