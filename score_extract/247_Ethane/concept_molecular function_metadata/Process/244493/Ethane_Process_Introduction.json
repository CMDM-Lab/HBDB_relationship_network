    "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a product of lipid peroxidation, a biological process associated with oxidative stress (OS). The study highlights ethane's potential as a breath biomarker for OS, particularly in lung cancer patients. The relationship is significant as ethane's production is directly linked to the metabolic process of lipid peroxidation, which is relevant in the context of respiratory diseases and cancer."
