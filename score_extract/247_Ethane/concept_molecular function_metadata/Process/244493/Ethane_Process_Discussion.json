    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in breath analysis. However, the study indicates a null correlation between exhaled ethane levels and the presence of disease, suggesting that OS may not be the primary process influencing breath ethane patterns. This highlights the complexity of breath analysis and the need for further research to clarify the processes involved in breath exhalates and their clinical implications."
