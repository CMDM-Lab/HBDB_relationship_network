    "summary": "In this context, ethane is mentioned in relation to free radical damage and the potential effects of inhibitors like superoxide dismutase. The study aims to measure exhaled ethane as a control to assess the effectiveness of these inhibitors in blocking free radical damage during ischemic events. Ethane serves as a biomarker for oxidative stress, while inhibitors are proposed to mitigate this damage, indicating a significant relationship between them in the context of oxidative stress management."
