    "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) produced in vivo through lipid peroxidation, making it a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS). Hydrocarbons, which include a range of organic compounds, are discussed in relation to VOCs in exhaled breath analysis, particularly in lung cancer patients. Ethane's specific role as a biomarker highlights its connection to the broader category of hydrocarbons, although the focus is primarily on its unique properties and measurement challenges in breath analysis."
