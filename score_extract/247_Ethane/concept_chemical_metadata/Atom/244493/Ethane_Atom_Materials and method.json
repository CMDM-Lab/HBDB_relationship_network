    "summary": "In this context, ethane is discussed in relation to a measurement technique that relies on sub-atomic optical transitions within ethane molecules. The focus is on the calibration and sensitivity of the instrument used to detect ethane gas, highlighting the atomic-level interactions that enable accurate measurement. However, the relationship between ethane and the concept of 'atom' is primarily technical and does not delve into broader biological or chemical implications."
