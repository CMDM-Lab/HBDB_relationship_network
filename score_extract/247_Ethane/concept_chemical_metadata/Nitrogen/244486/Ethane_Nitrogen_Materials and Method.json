    "summary": "In this context, ethane and nitrogen are related through the process of purging exhaled breath samples with ethane-free nitrogen to ensure accurate measurement of ethane concentrations. The use of nitrogen serves as a carrier gas to eliminate ethane interference during analysis, highlighting its role in the experimental setup rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction between the two gases."
