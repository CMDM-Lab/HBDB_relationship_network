    "summary": "In this context, ethane is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) produced in vivo through lipid peroxidation, making it a potential biomarker for oxidative stress (OS) in lung cancer patients. The relationship between ethane and organic chemicals is significant, as ethane is categorized within the broader group of organic chemicals, specifically hydrocarbons, and its measurement is crucial for assessing oxidative damage in respiratory diseases. The study emphasizes the challenges in detecting ethane at low concentrations, highlighting its relevance in the analysis of organic chemicals in breath samples."
