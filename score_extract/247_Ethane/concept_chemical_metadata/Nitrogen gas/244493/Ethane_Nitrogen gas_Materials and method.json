    "summary": "In this context, ethane and nitrogen gas are mentioned in relation to a measurement technique for detecting ethane concentrations in breath samples. Nitrogen gas is used to flush the measurement cell to ensure it is free from hydrocarbons, thereby preventing interference during the ethane measurement process. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship between ethane and nitrogen gas beyond this calibration role."
