    "summary": "In this context, ethane and pentane are both mentioned as alkanes used as noninvasive markers of lipid peroxidation in exhaled breath analysis. The preference for ethane over pentane is highlighted due to pentane's rapid metabolism, which complicates its quantification. This suggests a comparative relationship where ethane is favored for its reliability in measuring lipid peroxidation, while pentane's metabolism poses challenges in analysis."
