    "summary": "In this context, ethane is measured using a laser absorption spectroscopy technique that employs a lead-salt tunable diode laser. The lead salt is crucial for the laser's operation at the specific wavelength where ethane absorption transitions occur. Thus, while ethane and lead salt are not directly related in function, the lead salt is essential for the measurement of ethane concentrations in breath samples, indicating a technical relationship rather than a biological or chemical one."
