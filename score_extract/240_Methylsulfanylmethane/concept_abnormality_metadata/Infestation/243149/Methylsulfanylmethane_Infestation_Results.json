    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is indirectly related to infestation through the study of emissions from roots infested with larvae. The rapid increase in m/z 60 emissions, which is associated with glucosinolate conversion, suggests that infestation by larvae influences the biochemical processes in the roots, potentially affecting the production of DMS. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and DMS is not directly linked to the infestation process itself."
