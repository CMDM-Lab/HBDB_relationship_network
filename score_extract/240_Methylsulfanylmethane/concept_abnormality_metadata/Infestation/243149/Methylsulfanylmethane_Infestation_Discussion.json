    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to infestation through the study of volatile responses in plant roots following damage from root-feeding insects. The research highlights how root damage triggers the release of certain volatile compounds, including those derived from glucosinolates, which may be involved in plant defense mechanisms against infestations. However, Methylsulfanylmethane itself is not specifically mentioned as a direct response to infestation, limiting the strength of their relationship."
