    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is mentioned in relation to emissions resulting from the enzymatic conversion of glucosinolates by myrosinase, while the FASTK gene is not directly referenced or linked to any specific function or interaction with DMS. The context primarily discusses the emissions related to plant damage and does not provide any evidence of a relationship between DMS and the FASTK gene, which is typically associated with mitochondrial function and RNA processing."
