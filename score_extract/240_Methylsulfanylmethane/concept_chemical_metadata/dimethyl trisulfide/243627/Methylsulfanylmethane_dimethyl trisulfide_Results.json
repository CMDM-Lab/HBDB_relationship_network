    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl trisulfide are both volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) mentioned in relation to their potential odorous implications in sewer headspace air. While the text discusses various VSCs and their concentrations, it does not provide a direct comparison or specific interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl trisulfide, indicating they are part of a broader category of odorants of interest without detailing their relationship."
