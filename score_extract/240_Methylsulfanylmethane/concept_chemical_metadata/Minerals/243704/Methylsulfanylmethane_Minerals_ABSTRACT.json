    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is indirectly related to minerals through its role in the production of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSC) during the degradation of methoxylated aromatic compounds in mineral media. However, the specific relationship between MSM and minerals is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on microbial processes rather than a direct interaction or dependency on mineral content."
