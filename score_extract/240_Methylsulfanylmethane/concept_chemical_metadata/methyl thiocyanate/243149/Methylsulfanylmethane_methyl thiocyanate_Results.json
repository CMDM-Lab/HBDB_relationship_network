    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and methyl thiocyanate are discussed as potential breakdown products of glucosinolates, specifically in relation to their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns. The study investigates various thiocyanates and isothiocyanates, including methyl thiocyanate, as candidates for the parent mass observed in the analysis. While both compounds are part of the same analytical framework, their direct relationship is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from glucosinolate breakdown."
