    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and methyl thiocyanate are both mentioned as volatile compounds identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. They are part of a broader study on plant volatiles, but no specific interaction or functional relationship between the two compounds is discussed. Their mention is primarily in the context of identification and analysis rather than any direct biochemical or physiological relevance."
