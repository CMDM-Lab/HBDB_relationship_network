    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and thiocyanic acid (HCNS) are discussed in relation to their isotopic abundance ratios as measured by PTR-MS. The study indicates that HCNS, or a larger molecule that fragments into HCNS, is a potential source for the mass signal m/z 60. This suggests a connection between the breakdown products of glucosinolates and the presence of thiocyanic acid, with Methylsulfanylmethane potentially being involved in this process, although the direct relationship is not explicitly detailed."
