    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is discussed in relation to its degradation pathways involving various metabolites, including oxides. The strain Bacillus cereus GIGAN2 is noted for degrading DMS to S-oxide (DMDSO), indicating a direct relationship where DMS is transformed into an oxide form during microbial degradation. This highlights the biochemical processes involved in the conversion of DMS to oxidized products."
