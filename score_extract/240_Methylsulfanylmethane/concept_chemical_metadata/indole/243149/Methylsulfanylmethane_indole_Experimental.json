    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and indole are both mentioned as plant volatile compounds identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are listed among other volatiles analyzed for their mass spectra, indicating they are part of a broader study on plant volatiles without specific relevance to each other."
