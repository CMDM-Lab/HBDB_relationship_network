    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned alongside methyl groups in relation to the demethylation activity of strain SYR1. The study investigates the formation of methyl thioether (MT) from sulfide and the influence of temperature on demethylation processes. Methyl groups are integral to the chemical structure and reactions involving methylsulfanylmethane, indicating a direct relationship in the context of biochemical transformations."
