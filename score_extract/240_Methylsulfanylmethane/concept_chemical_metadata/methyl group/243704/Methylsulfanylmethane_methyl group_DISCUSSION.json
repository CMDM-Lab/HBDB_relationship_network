    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (MT) is discussed in relation to the methyl group, which serves as a donor in the methylation process that leads to the formation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) in freshwater sediments. The methyl group is essential for the methylation of sulfide, indicating a direct biochemical relationship where the methyl group facilitates the production of MT and DMS through microbial activity. This highlights the importance of the methyl group in the metabolic pathways involving MT."
