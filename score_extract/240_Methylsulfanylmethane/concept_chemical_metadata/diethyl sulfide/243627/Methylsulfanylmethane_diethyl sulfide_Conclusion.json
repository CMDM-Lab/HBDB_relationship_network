    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and diethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odorant prioritization in sewage environments. While diethyl sulfide is identified as a priority odorant in a specific city, methyl mercaptan (closely related to methylsulfanylmethane) is noted as a key odorant across all sites. However, there is no direct interaction or detailed relationship established between methylsulfanylmethane and diethyl sulfide beyond their categorization as odorants."
