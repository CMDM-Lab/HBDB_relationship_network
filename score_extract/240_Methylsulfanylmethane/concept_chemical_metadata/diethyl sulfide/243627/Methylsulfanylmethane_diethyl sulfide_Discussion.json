    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (methyl mercaptan) and diethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detected in emissions from various sources. However, the context primarily focuses on the dominance of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, with diethyl sulfide being noted as present in much lower concentrations. There is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between methylsulfanylmethane and diethyl sulfide beyond their classification as VSCs."
