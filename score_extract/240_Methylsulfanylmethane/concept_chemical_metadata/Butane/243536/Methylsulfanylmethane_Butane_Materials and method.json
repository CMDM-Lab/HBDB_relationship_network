    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and Butane are both mentioned as compounds analyzed in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) studies. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between them. They are part of a broader analysis of various thiols and their detection limits in air samples, indicating they are simply components of the same analytical process without any specific relevance to each other."
