    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (dimethylsulfide) and butane are both mentioned as components of air emissions, with a focus on their concentrations in relation to environmental changes. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between the two compounds. They are part of a broader analysis of air quality and odor-generating compounds, but their specific roles or connections are not elaborated upon."
