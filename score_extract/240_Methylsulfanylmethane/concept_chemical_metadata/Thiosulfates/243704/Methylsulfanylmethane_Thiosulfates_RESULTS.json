    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) and thiosulfates are mentioned in relation to the growth of strain SYR1 on syringate. The study indicates that thiosulfate, along with other reducing agents, did not inhibit the growth of the strain when sulfide was replaced, suggesting a non-toxic relationship. Additionally, the combined addition of thiosulfate with other compounds resulted in higher concentrations of DMS, indicating a potential interaction in metabolic processes involving sulfur compounds."
