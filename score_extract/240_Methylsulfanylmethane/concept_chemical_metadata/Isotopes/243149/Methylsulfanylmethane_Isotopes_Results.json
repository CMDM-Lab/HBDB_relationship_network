    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to isotopes through the discussion of mass spectrometry (GCâ€“MS) and the natural isotopic ratio observed in the breakdown products of glucosinolates. The mention of m/z 60 and its isotopic ratio suggests a potential link to the isotopic composition of the compounds analyzed, but there is no direct interaction or significant relevance established between Methylsulfanylmethane and isotopes themselves."
