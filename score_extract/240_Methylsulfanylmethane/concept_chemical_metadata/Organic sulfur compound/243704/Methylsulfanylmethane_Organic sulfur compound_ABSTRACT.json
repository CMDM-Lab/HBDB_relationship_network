    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (also known as methanethiol) is identified as a volatile organic sulfur compound (VSC) that contributes to odorous emissions from sewer systems. It is part of a broader category of organic sulfur compounds, which includes other VSCs like dimethyl sulfide (DMS). The discussion highlights the significance of these compounds in odour abatement processes, indicating that Methylsulfanylmethane is a specific example of an organic sulfur compound relevant to the study of sewer odours."
