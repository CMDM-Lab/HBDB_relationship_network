    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a study assessing odorant priority rankings across different cities. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. The focus is primarily on other key odorants, with 4-xylene not highlighted as a priority odorant in the same way as others like toluene or methyl mercaptan."
