    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to anions through the measurement of sulfate concentrations. The process described involves the oxidation of sulfides, which may include Methylsulfanylmethane, into sulfates, a type of anion. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and Methylsulfanylmethane is not the primary focus of the anion analysis."
