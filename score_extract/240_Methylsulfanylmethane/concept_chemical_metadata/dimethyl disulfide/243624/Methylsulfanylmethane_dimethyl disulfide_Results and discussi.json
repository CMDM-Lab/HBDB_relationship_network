    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is discussed as a substrate that is degraded by various bacterial strains, including Alcaligenes sp. SY1 and Bacillus cereus GIGAN2. Dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) is identified as a product of DMS degradation, indicating a direct biochemical relationship where DMS is converted into DMDS through microbial metabolic processes. This suggests that DMDS is part of the degradation pathway of DMS, highlighting their interconnected roles in sulfur compound metabolism."
