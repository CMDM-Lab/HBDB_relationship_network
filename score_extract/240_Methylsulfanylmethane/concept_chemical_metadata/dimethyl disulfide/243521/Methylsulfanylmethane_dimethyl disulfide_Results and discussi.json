    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane ((CH3)2S) and dimethyl disulfide ((CH3)2S2) are both sulfur-containing compounds that exhibit a poisoning effect on catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 and MnO/Fe2O3 at lower temperatures. The study highlights their roles in catalyst deactivation, indicating that both compounds can negatively impact the specific surface area of the catalysts, suggesting a direct relationship in terms of their effects on catalytic performance."
