    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being investigated for their catalytic conversion performance using a specific catalyst, MnO/Fe2O3. The experiments focus on the sulfur-poisoning effects of these compounds on the catalyst, indicating a direct relationship in terms of their chemical behavior and impact on catalytic processes in a petrochemical setting."
