    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (dimethyl sulfide) and dimethyl disulfide are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) studied for their catalytic incineration over a MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst. The research focuses on the kinetics of their conversion and the sulfur-poisoning effect on the catalyst, indicating a direct relationship in their behavior during catalytic processes. Both compounds are integral to understanding the efficiency and challenges of the catalytic incineration process."
