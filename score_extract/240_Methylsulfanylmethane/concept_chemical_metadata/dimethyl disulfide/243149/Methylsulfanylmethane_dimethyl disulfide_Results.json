    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) are both identified as volatile sulfur compounds released during the infestation of plants. The study highlights the emission of dimethyl disulfide in the root headspace of infested plants, indicating a potential relationship in their roles as plant volatiles. However, methylsulfanylmethane is not explicitly mentioned as being induced or measured, making the connection less direct."
