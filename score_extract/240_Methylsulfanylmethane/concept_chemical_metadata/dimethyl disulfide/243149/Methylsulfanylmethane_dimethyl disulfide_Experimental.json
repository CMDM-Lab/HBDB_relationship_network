    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as volatile compounds identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. They are part of a broader study on plant volatiles, but there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. Their mention is primarily in the context of identification and analysis rather than any functional or chemical relationship."
