    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odor monitoring in sewer headspace air. The study emphasizes the importance of non-hydrogen sulfide VSCs, including dimethyl disulfide, while methylsulfanylmethane is noted as a key odorant. However, their specific relationship or interaction is not detailed, indicating they are part of a broader category of compounds rather than having a direct connection."
