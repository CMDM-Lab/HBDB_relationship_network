    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both identified as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odor activity in various cities. While methylsulfanylmethane is not explicitly mentioned as a priority odorant, dimethyl disulfide is highlighted as a significant compound among the reduced sulfur compounds. Their relationship lies in their classification as VSCs, but no direct interaction or functional relationship is discussed."
