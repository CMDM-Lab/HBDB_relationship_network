    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) identified in the investigation of sewer odors. While methyl mercaptan and hydrogen sulfide were highlighted as key odorants, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide were noted as varying in priority across different sampling sites. This suggests a relationship where both compounds are part of the broader category of sulfur-based odorants, but their specific interactions or roles in odor formation are not detailed."
