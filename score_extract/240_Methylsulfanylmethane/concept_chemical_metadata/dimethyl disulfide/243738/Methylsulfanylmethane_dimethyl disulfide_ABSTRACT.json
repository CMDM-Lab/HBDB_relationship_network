    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide are both volatile organic sulfur compounds evaluated in microbial ecosystems. While the study focuses on their concentrations and the microbial populations capable of utilizing dimethyl sulfide (DMS), it does not explicitly detail the relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl disulfide. Their presence in the same ecosystem suggests a potential connection, but the specifics of their interaction or metabolic pathways are not discussed."
