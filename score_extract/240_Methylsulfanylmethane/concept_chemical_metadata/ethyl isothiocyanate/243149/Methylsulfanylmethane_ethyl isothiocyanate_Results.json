    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and ethyl isothiocyanate are both mentioned as potential breakdown products of glucosinolates, specifically in relation to their mass spectra and fragmentation patterns. The study investigates various thiocyanates and isothiocyanates, including ethyl isothiocyanate, as candidates for the parent mass m/z 60, indicating a shared biochemical pathway or origin in the context of volatile organic compound analysis."
