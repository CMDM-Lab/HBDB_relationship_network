    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and Sodium Dithionite are both mentioned as compounds used in the preparation of anaerobic cultures. Sodium Dithionite is specifically listed as a reducing agent in the defined medium, while Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly linked to any specific function or interaction with Sodium Dithionite. Their relationship is primarily based on their roles in the same experimental setup, without detailed discussion of their interactions or combined effects."
