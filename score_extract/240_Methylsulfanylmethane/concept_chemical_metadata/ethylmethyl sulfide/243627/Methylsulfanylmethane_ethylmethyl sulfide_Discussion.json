    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and ethylmethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) detected in various studies of emissions. However, the context primarily focuses on the dominance of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan, with ethylmethyl sulfide noted as having very low concentrations. There is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between methylsulfanylmethane and ethylmethyl sulfide beyond their classification as VSCs."
