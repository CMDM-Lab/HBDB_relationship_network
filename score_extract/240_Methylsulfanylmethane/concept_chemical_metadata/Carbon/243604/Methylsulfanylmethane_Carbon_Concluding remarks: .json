    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is discussed in relation to its emissions from marine phytoplankton, which are influenced by changing ocean temperatures and pH levels. The relationship to carbon arises as the study highlights the potential impact of DMS emissions on global carbon budgets, particularly as cyanobacteria, which produce isoprene, may become more dominant in warmer oceans. This suggests a significant interaction between DMS emissions and carbon cycling in marine ecosystems."
