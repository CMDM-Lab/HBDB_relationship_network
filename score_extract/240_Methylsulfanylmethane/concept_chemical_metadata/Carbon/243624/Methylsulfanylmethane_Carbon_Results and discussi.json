    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is utilized as a carbon source by Alcaligenes sp. SY1, leading to the conversion of DMS into carbon dioxide (CO2) during the degradation process. The stoichiometric relationship indicates that for every mole of DMS, two moles of CO2 are produced, highlighting a direct metabolic pathway where DMS serves as a carbon source for bacterial growth and CO2 generation. The study emphasizes the efficiency of DMS in carbon utilization, with a significant portion of the carbon being converted to CO2 and biomass."
