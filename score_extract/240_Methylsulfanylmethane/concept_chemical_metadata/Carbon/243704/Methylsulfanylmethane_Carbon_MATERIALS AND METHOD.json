    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is not directly discussed in relation to carbon, but carbon is mentioned as part of the gas mixture (N2-CO2) used during the incubation process. The relationship appears to be incidental, as carbon serves as a component of the atmosphere in which the biological processes occur, rather than indicating a specific interaction or functional relationship with Methylsulfanylmethane."
