    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (dimethyl sulfide) is indirectly related to inorganic oxygen compounds through its oxidation processes in the atmosphere. The study discusses the photochemical reactions involving reduced sulfur gases, including dimethyl sulfide, and their conversion to sulfur dioxide (SO2), an inorganic oxygen compound. The focus is on the atmospheric oxidation pathways and the production of oxygen-containing sulfur compounds, indicating a connection between these two terms through environmental chemistry."
