    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMSP) and isoprene are discussed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by certain marine phytoplankton. While many phytoplankton predominantly emit either DMSP or isoprene, some species can produce both, indicating a complex evolutionary relationship. The text highlights the significance of these compounds in oceanic emissions and their biosynthesis, suggesting that their coexistence in certain organisms may provide insights into ecological and evolutionary dynamics."
