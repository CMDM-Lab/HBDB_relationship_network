    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) and isoprene are both highlighted for their convergent antioxidant functions in protecting against reactive oxygen species (ROS) in phytoplankton and higher plants, respectively. Both compounds exhibit similar responses to environmental stressors, suggesting they may play analogous roles in metabolic protection across different ecosystems. The evidence indicates that both DMS and isoprene contribute to maintaining metabolic integrity under oxidative stress, reinforcing their functional convergence as antioxidants in marine and terrestrial environments."
