    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) and isoprene are discussed in relation to their emissions from phytoplankton in changing oceanic conditions. The text highlights the potential biochemical and functional links between DMS emissions and isoprene, particularly as cyanobacteria, which are significant sources of isoprene, may become more dominant in warmer oceans. This suggests a complex interaction between these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that could impact global atmospheric sulfur and carbon cycles."
