    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) and isoprene are both mentioned as compounds emitted by marine organisms, specifically dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, in nutrient-depleted waters. The discussion highlights their roles in the marine ecosystem and their potential impact on atmospheric chemistry and climate feedback. However, the relationship between DMS and isoprene is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
