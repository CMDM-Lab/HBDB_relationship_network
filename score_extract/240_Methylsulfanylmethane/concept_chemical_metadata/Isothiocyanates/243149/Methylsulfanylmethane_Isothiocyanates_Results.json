    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and isothiocyanates are discussed in relation to the breakdown products of glucosinolates. The study investigates the fragmentation patterns of various volatile compounds, including isothiocyanates, which are derived from glucosinolates. Methylsulfanylmethane is considered a candidate for the mass m/z 60, indicating a potential connection in their chemical behavior and origin during the analysis of these compounds."
