    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned as one of the sulfur-bearing compounds present in the air around industrial sources, particularly in relation to odorous organic sulfur compounds. Sulfhydryl compounds, which include various sulfur-containing organic molecules, are relevant here as they encompass methylsulfanylmethane. The study highlights the presence of multiple sulfur compounds in the environment, indicating a broader category that includes methylsulfanylmethane as a specific example of sulfhydryl compounds."
