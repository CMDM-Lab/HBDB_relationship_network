    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (dimethylsulfide) is identified as a significant component among the emissions and ambient air samples analyzed, alongside other sulfhydryl compounds such as 2-propane thiol and 2-butane thiol. Both Methylsulfanylmethane and sulfhydryl compounds are discussed in relation to their presence in air samples, indicating a shared category of volatile sulfur compounds. However, the specific interactions or functional relationships between them are not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their connection."
