    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and carbonyl sulfide are both mentioned as sulfur-bearing compounds found in air samples from industrial and agricultural sources, particularly around piggeries and manure storage areas. While they are part of a broader study on airborne sulfur compounds, the specific relationship or interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and carbonyl sulfide is not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct connection."
