    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and carbonyl sulfide are both volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) mentioned in studies monitoring emissions from wastewater treatment plants. While carbonyl sulfide was detected at lower concentrations in the studies referenced, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are part of a broader analysis of sulfur emissions but are not shown to influence each other or share a specific functional connection."
