    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is discussed as an organic sulfur compound that is emitted into the atmosphere and can be oxidized to various sulfur compounds, including sulfuric acid esters. While the relationship is implied through the oxidation process of DMS to other sulfur compounds, the context does not provide a direct or detailed interaction between Methylsulfanylmethane and sulfuric acid esters, focusing instead on the broader sulfur cycle and emissions from various sources."
