    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (MT) is produced through the methylation of sulfide using methoxylated aromatic compounds as methyl group donors. This indicates a biochemical relationship where aromatic compounds play a crucial role in the formation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) like MT in freshwater sediments. The addition of specific aromatic compounds, such as syringate, leads to increased levels of DMS, further highlighting the interaction between these compounds in microbial processes."
