    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and thiocyanates are discussed in relation to the breakdown products of glucosinolates from B. nigra roots. The study investigates the fragmentation patterns of various volatile compounds, including thiocyanates, suggesting that methylsulfanylmethane may be related to the formation of thiocyanates through metabolic processes. However, the specific interaction between these two compounds is not deeply explored."
