    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are both mentioned as organic sulfur compounds, with DMS being produced naturally by phytoplankton and also through anthropogenic processes. While methylsulfanylmethane is not directly discussed in relation to DMS, both compounds are part of the broader category of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) and may share similar sources or pathways in environmental contexts. However, the specific relationship between them is not elaborated upon."
