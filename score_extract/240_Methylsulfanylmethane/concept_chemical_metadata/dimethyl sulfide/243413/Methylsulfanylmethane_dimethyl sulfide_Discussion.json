    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are related through their potential metabolic pathways in aquatic environments. The study suggests that the metabolism of methionine by bacteria and possibly algae could lead to the production of DMS, indicating a biochemical relationship where MSM may serve as a precursor or contribute to DMS formation in the metalimnion of Linsley Pond. The observed correlation between the profiles of DMS and other sulfide compounds further supports this connection."
