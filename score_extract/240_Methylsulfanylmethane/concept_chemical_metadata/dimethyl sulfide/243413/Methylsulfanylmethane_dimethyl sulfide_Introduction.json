    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are both mentioned as volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) produced in marine environments. DMS is highlighted as the primary VOSC source, contributing significantly to biogenic sulfur emissions. While methylsulfanylmethane is not directly linked to DMS in terms of production or function, both are part of the broader discussion on VOSCs in oceanic systems, indicating a shared ecological relevance."
