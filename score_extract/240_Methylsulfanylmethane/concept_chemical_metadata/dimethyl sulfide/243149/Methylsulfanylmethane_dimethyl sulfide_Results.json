    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are related through their roles as volatile organic compounds emitted by plants, particularly in response to infestation. The study confirms the induction of DMS in the root headspace of infested plants, indicating a potential biochemical pathway involving methylsulfanylmethane as a precursor or related compound in the emission of DMS during plant stress responses. However, the specific relationship between the two compounds is not elaborated upon in detail."
