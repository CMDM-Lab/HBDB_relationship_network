    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (also known as dimethyl sulfide, DMS) is discussed in relation to its poisoning effects on catalysts such as Pt/Al2O3 and MnO/Fe2O3. The study highlights how DMS and its derivatives negatively impact the performance of these catalysts at various temperatures, indicating a direct relationship between the presence of DMS and catalyst efficiency. The findings suggest that DMS contributes to catalyst deactivation through sulfur poisoning, which is a critical aspect of the study."
