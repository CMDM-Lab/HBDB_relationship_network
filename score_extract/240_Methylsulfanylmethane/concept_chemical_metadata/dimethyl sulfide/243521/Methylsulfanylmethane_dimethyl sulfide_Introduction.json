    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) studied for their catalytic incineration over a MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst. The research focuses on the kinetics of converting these compounds, indicating a direct relationship in their behavior during catalytic processes. The study highlights the sulfur-poisoning effect on the catalyst, which is relevant to both compounds, suggesting they may share similar degradation pathways in catalytic reactions."
