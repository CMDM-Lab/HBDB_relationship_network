    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odorant prioritization in sewage environments. While methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide are identified as key odorants across various sampling sites, the relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide is not explicitly detailed, indicating they may share similar roles in odor production but lack direct interaction or comparison in the study."
