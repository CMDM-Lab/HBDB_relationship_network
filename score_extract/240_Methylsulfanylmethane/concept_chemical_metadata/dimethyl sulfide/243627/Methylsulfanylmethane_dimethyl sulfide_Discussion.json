    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both mentioned as volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) relevant to odor evaluation in sewer headspace air. While the study emphasizes the importance of dimethyl sulfide among other VSCs, it does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide, indicating they are part of a broader category of compounds being monitored for odor assessment."
