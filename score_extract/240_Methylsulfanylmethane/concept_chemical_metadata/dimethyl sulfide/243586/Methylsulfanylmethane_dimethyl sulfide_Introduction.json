    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) are both sulfur-containing compounds involved in catalytic processes. The study discusses the catalytic incineration of dimethyl sulfide, highlighting the effects of various parameters on its conversion. Methylsulfanylmethane is mentioned as a compound that can interfere with the catalytic performance of dimethyl sulfide, indicating a direct relationship where the presence of CH3SH affects the conversion efficiency of (CH3)2S."
