    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both sulfur-containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in a catalytic incineration experiment. The study focuses on the catalytic conversion of dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S) and its interaction with methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) to assess the effects of sulfur poisoning on the catalyst. Their relationship is significant as they are both part of the same experimental setup aimed at understanding VOC conversion processes in petrochemical waste gas treatment."
