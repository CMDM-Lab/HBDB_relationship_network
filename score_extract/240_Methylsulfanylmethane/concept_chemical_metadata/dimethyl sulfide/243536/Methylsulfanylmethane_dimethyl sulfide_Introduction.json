    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide are both mentioned as sulfur-bearing compounds found in air samples from industrial and agricultural sources, particularly around piggeries and manure storage areas. While they are part of a broader discussion on odorous organic sulfur compounds, the specific relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and dimethyl sulfide is not elaborated upon, indicating they are part of the same category of compounds without direct interaction or functional relevance highlighted in the study."
