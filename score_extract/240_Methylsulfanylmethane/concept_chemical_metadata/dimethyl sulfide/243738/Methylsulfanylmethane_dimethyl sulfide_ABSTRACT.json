    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as both are volatile organic sulfur compounds involved in microbial ecosystems. The study evaluates the concentrations of DMS and its precursors, indicating that DMS can be produced from the hydrolysis of methylsulfanylmethane's precursor, dimethylsulfoniopropionate. However, the specific relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and DMS is not explicitly detailed."
