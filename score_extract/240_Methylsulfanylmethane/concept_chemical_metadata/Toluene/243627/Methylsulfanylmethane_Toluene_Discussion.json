    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified in studies related to sewage and wastewater treatment. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are presented as part of a broader analysis of VOCs without any direct interaction or comparative significance highlighted. Toluene is noted as a dominant VOC, but Methylsulfanylmethane's specific role or relevance in relation to toluene is not established."
