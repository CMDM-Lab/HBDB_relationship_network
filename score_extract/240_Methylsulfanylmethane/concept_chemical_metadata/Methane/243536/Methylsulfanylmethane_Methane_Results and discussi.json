    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (dimethyl sulfide) and methane are both mentioned as thiols and volatile compounds in air samples. However, the context primarily discusses the concentrations of various sulfur compounds, including dimethyl sulfide, without establishing a direct relationship or interaction between methylsulfanylmethane and methane. Their mention appears coincidental, as they are part of a broader analysis of air quality and emissions."
