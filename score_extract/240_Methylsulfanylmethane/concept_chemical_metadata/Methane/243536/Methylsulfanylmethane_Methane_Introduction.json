    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane and methane are both mentioned as sulfur-bearing compounds found in the air around manure storage areas. While methane is specifically identified as a compound detected in air samples, methylsulfanylmethane is not directly linked to any specific health effects or interactions with methane. The focus is on the presence of various sulfur compounds in the environment, indicating a general association rather than a detailed relationship between the two."
