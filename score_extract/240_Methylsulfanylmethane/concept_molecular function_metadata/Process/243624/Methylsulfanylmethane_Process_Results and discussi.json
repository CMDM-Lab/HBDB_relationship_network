    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane is involved in a degradation process where various factors such as pH, sulfur concentration (S), and other parameters influence its conversion efficiency. The study highlights how these conditions affect the degradation of DMS, indicating that Methylsulfanylmethane plays a critical role in the overall process of DMS degradation, with specific conditions leading to optimal conversion rates."
