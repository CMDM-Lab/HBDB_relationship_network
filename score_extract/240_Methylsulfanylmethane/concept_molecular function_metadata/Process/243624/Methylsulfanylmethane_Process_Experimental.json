    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (DMS) is evaluated as a substrate in a biodegradation process. The study employs response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize various process parameters such as temperature, pH, salinity, and initial DMS concentration to enhance the biodegradation efficiency. The relationship is centered on how these process variables affect the conversion of DMS over time, indicating a direct link between the compound and the experimental process designed for its degradation."
