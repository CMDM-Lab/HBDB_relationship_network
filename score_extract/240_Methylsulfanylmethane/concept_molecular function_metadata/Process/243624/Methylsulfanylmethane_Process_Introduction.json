    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is indirectly related to the term 'process' through its mention as a compound involved in various anthropogenic processes, including emissions from industrial activities. While the context discusses the production and transformation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and its relevance in environmental and industrial processes, MSM is not explicitly detailed as a key player in these processes, limiting the depth of their relationship."
