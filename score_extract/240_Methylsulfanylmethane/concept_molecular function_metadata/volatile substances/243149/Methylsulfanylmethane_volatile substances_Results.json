    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is indirectly related to volatile substances as it is part of the analysis of volatile compounds released during plant infestation. The study highlights the emission of various sulfides, including dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which are volatile substances. However, MSM itself is not specifically mentioned as being emitted or analyzed, indicating a more general connection to the category of volatile substances rather than a direct relationship."
