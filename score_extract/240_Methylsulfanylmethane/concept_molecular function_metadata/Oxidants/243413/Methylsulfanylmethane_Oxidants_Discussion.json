    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MeSH) is discussed in relation to its oxidation by oxidants, such as oxygen, to form dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). The text highlights the degradation of methionine leading to MeSH production, which can be easily oxidized, indicating a direct chemical relationship between MeSH and oxidants in the formation of methylated sulfides in aquatic environments. This suggests that oxidants play a crucial role in the transformation of MeSH into DMDS, linking these two terms through their chemical interactions in the environment."
