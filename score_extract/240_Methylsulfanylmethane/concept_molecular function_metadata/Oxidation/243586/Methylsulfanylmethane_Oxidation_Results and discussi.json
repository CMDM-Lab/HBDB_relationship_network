    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane ((CH3)2S) is discussed in relation to its oxidation process. The study indicates that the conversion of (CH3)2S to CO2 and SO2 occurs at elevated temperatures, with significant oxidation observed at 230°C and near-complete oxidation at 380°C. This highlights the relationship between methylsulfanylmethane and oxidation, as the compound undergoes transformation into oxidized products under specific thermal conditions."
