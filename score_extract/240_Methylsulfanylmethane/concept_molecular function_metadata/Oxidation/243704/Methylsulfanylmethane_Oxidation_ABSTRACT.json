    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to oxidation through its role in the production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and methanethiol (MT), which are oxidation products that contribute to global warming and the sulfur cycle. The oxidation of these compounds leads to the formation of methanesulfonic acid and sulfur dioxide, highlighting the significance of methylsulfanylmethane in biochemical processes involving oxidation, particularly in marine and freshwater ecosystems."
