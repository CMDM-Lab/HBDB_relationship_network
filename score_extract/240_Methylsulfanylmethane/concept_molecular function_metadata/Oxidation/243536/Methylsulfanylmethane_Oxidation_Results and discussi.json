    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane is indirectly related to oxidation through its role as a reduced sulfur gas that undergoes photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. The study discusses the oxidation of dimethylsulfide, a compound related to methylsulfanylmethane, highlighting the production of sulfur compounds like SO2 during oxidation processes initiated by OH radicals. This suggests that methylsulfanylmethane may also participate in similar oxidation pathways, although it is not explicitly mentioned."
