    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is indirectly related to physiological aspects through its role in the formation of volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) in freshwater ecosystems. The physiological aspects are implied in the discussion of microbial activity and the biochemical processes involved in VOSC formation, which are crucial for understanding methane production and sulfide concentration in sediments. However, the specific physiological implications of MSM are not explicitly detailed."
