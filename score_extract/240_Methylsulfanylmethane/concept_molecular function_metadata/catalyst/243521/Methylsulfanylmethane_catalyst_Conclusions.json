    "summary": "In this context, Methylsulfanylmethane (MSM) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that exhibits sulfur-poisoning effects on the MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst used for VOC conversion. The study indicates that while MSM can negatively impact catalyst performance, this effect diminishes at higher operating temperatures (above 350Â°C). Thus, there is a direct relationship where MSM influences the efficacy of the catalyst under specific conditions."
