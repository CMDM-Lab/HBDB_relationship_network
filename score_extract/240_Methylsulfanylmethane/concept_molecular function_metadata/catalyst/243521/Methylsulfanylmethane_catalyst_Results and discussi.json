    "summary": "In this context, methylsulfanylmethane ((CH3)2S) is evaluated as a substrate undergoing catalytic incineration using various catalysts, specifically Cr2O3/Al2O3 and MnO/Fe2O3. The study highlights the performance of these catalysts in converting (CH3)2S, with MnO/Fe2O3 being identified as the more effective catalyst. The formation of MnS on the catalyst is also noted, indicating a direct relationship between the substrate and the catalyst's activity."
