    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are both identified as significant air pollutants contributing to respiratory issues, particularly asthma and allergies. While SO2 levels have decreased due to industrial regulations, NOx levels have risen due to increased vehicular traffic. This shift in air pollution composition may have implications for public health, particularly in urban areas where these pollutants are prevalent."
