    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as an air pollutant associated with increased risks of preeclampsia among asthmatic women. While the term 'elements' is mentioned, it refers to elemental carbon and does not directly relate to sulfur dioxide. The study highlights the novel association of SO2 with preeclampsia, but does not elaborate on its relationship with other elements, indicating a lack of direct connection between SO2 and the broader category of elements."
