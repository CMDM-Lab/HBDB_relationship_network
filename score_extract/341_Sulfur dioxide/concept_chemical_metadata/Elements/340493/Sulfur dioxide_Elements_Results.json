    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a pollutant whose exposure is analyzed in relation to pregnancy outcomes, particularly in asthmatic and non-asthmatic women. The term 'elements' likely refers to elemental carbon and other elemental pollutants discussed in the study. While SO2 is part of the broader discussion on air quality and its health impacts, the specific relationship between SO2 and the broader category of elements is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
