    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and coal are indirectly related through the discussion of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts of biomass-based power generation. While coal is mentioned as a fuel source, the focus is on the emissions from biomass power generation, with no direct connection established between sulfur dioxide and coal's combustion or its specific emissions profile. Thus, their relationship is not explicitly detailed."
