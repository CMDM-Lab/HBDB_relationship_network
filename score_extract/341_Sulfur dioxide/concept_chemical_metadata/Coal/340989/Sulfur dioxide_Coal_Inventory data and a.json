    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to coal through the process of direct co-firing, where biomass and coal are burned together in the same boiler. The combustion of coal is known to produce sulfur dioxide as a byproduct, which has significant environmental and health impacts. The mention of coal in the context of biomass co-firing implies a consideration of sulfur dioxide emissions resulting from this energy production method, although the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and coal is not explicitly detailed."
