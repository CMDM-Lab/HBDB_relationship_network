    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to coal as a major fossil fuel contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Alberta. The burning of coal for electricity generation is a significant source of SO2 emissions, which are a byproduct of coal combustion. The discussion focuses on the environmental impact of coal and the need for transitioning to renewable energy sources to mitigate GHG emissions, including SO2."
