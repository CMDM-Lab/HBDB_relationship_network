    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to air quality monitoring near a coal-fired power plant. The concentrations of SO2 were derived from data collected in the vicinity of coal combustion, indicating a direct link between coal burning and the emission of sulfur dioxide. This relationship highlights the environmental impact of coal as a source of SO2 pollution, which is relevant for assessing air quality and potential health effects on wildlife, such as quail and kestrels."
