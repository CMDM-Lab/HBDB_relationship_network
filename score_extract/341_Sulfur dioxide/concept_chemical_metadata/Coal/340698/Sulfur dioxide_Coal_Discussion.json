    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a contaminant emitted from coal-fired power plants, which has been studied for its long-term effects on wildlife, particularly passerines and rodents. The study highlights the impact of SO2 exposure on respiratory health, evidenced by excessive mucus and shorter cilia in the tracheas of exposed birds. This establishes a direct relationship between coal combustion and the release of SO2, linking coal as a source of this harmful pollutant affecting animal health."
