    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon are both mentioned as pollutants associated with increased health risks during pregnancy, particularly for asthmatic individuals. The study highlights significant interactions between SO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the first trimester, as well as elemental carbon exposure throughout the pregnancy. While SO2 exposure showed risk reductions for non-asthmatics, the overall relationship indicates that both pollutants are relevant in assessing respiratory risks during pregnancy, especially for asthmatics."
