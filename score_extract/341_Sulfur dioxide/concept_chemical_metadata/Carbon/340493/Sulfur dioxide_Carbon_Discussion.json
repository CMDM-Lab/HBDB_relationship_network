    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon are both mentioned as pollutants associated with increased risks of preeclampsia among asthmatic women. The study highlights that first trimester exposure to NOx and SO2, along with whole pregnancy exposure to elemental carbon, correlates with higher preeclampsia risks. While SO2 is noted for its novel association with preeclampsia, carbon is included as part of the broader analysis of elemental pollutants, indicating a potential link to adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in women with asthma."
