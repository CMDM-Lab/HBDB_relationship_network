    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned in relation to organic chemicals, but the discussion revolves around the exchange of trace gases, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), with vegetation and soil. While sulfur dioxide is an inorganic gas, the context highlights the behavior of organic chemicals in relation to their absorption and partitioning in plant systems. Thus, the relationship is indirect, focusing on the broader category of air pollutants rather than a specific interaction with sulfur dioxide."
