    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to organic chemicals as it is often used as a preservative in wine production, which involves the fermentation of organic compounds by S. cerevisiae. The analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the wines produced by different yeast strains suggests that SO2 may influence the composition and relative amounts of these organic chemicals, although the specific interactions are not detailed in the provided text."
