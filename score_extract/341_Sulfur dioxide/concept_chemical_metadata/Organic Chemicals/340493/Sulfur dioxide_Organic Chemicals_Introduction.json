    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a component of air pollution, which can exacerbate asthma. While organic chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are also discussed in relation to air quality and health outcomes, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and organic chemicals is not directly addressed. They are both part of the broader discussion on air pollutants affecting health, particularly in pregnant women with asthma, but no direct interaction or correlation is established."
