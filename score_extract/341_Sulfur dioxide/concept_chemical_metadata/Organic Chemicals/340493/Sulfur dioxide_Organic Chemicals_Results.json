    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned alongside organic chemicals as part of a study examining the risks associated with exposure to various pollutants during pregnancy, particularly in asthmatic and non-asthmatic women. The interactions between SO2 and organic compounds, such as elemental carbon and VOCs, indicate a potential link to elevated health risks, particularly for asthmatics. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and organic chemicals is not deeply explored beyond their association with risk estimates in the context of air pollution exposure during pregnancy."
