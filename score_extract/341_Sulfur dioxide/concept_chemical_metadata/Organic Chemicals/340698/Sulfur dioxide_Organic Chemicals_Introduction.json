    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as one of the major airborne contaminants emitted from oil sands operations, alongside other organic chemicals such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study aims to investigate the immunotoxic and stress-mediated effects of these airborne pollutants, including SO2, on birds, highlighting the relevance of organic chemicals in assessing environmental impacts on wildlife. However, the specific interactions between SO2 and organic chemicals are not elaborated upon in detail."
