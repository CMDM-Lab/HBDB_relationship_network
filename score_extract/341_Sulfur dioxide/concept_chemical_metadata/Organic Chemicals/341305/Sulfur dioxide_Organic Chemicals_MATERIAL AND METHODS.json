    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed in relation to health outcomes in children, alongside organic chemicals such as benzene and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While SO2 is a specific pollutant, organic chemicals represent a broader category of compounds that can include various harmful substances. The relationship is indirect, as both are part of the air quality assessment but not specifically linked in terms of their interactions or combined effects on health."
