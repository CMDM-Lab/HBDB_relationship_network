    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a significant air pollutant that has decreased in concentration over the years, while organic chemicals, particularly those from traffic-related air pollutants, have increased. The changing mix of air pollutants, including SO2 and organic compounds, may have implications for the rising prevalence of asthma and allergies, indicating a potential relationship between these pollutants and respiratory health issues. However, the specific interactions between SO2 and organic chemicals are not detailed."
