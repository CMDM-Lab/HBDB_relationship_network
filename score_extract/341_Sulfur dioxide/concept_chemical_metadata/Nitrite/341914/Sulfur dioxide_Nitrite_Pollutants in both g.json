    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrite are mentioned in relation to their chemistry in water-soluble gases. The text discusses how weak acid solutes like nitrite have related gas phases, such as SO2, indicating a connection in their behavior in aquatic systems. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, focusing more on the general chemistry of these compounds rather than a direct interaction or specific functional relationship."
