    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned, but carbonyl compounds, including acetaldehyde and ketones, are discussed in relation to the production of wines by different S. cerevisiae strains. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking for its preservative and antioxidant properties, the relationship with carbonyl compounds is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, indicating a lack of direct interaction or relevance between the two terms in this specific context."
