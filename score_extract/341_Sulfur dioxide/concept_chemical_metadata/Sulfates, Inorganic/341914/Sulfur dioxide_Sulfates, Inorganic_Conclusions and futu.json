    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its atmospheric conversion to sulfates, which are inorganic compounds. The reduction of SO2 emissions has led to decreased sulfate concentrations in precipitation, indicating a direct relationship where SO2 acts as a precursor to sulfate formation. The ongoing research aims to understand the dynamics of this conversion and its geographical variability, highlighting the importance of SO2 in the sulfate deposition process."
