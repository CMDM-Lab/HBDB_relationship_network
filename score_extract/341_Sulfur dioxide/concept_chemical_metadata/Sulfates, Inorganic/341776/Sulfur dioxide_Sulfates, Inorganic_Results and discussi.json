    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation to sulfates (SO4^2-) under the influence of solar radiation and higher ozone concentrations. The study highlights that the conversion of SO2 to sulfate is affected by photochemical processes, with higher ozone levels in Volos leading to increased oxidation rates compared to Patras. This indicates a significant relationship where SO2 levels are inversely related to sulfate formation due to environmental conditions."
