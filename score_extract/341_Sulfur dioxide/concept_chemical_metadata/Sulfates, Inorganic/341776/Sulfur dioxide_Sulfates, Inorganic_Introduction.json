    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation and conversion into particulate sulfates (SO4^2-) as part of urban air photochemistry. This process is significant for understanding the formation of secondary pollutants, which include inorganic sulfates. The relationship highlights how SO2 contributes to sulfate formation, impacting air quality and environmental health."
