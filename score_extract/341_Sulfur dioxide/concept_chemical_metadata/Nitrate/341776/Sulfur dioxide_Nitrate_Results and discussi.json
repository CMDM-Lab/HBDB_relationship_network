    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrate (NO3) are indirectly related through the oxidation processes influenced by ozone concentrations. The text discusses how SO2 can be oxidized to sulfate and how NO2 can be converted to nitrate, with both processes depending on photochemical reactions. The higher ozone levels in Volos facilitate the conversion of SO2 to sulfate, while the oxidation of NO2 to nitrate is also mentioned, indicating a shared pathway in atmospheric chemistry. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, focusing more on the environmental conditions affecting these conversions."
