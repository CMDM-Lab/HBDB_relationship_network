    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and ozone are both mentioned as components of atmospheric gases that interact with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and contribute to ozone production. While sulfur dioxide is recognized as a traditional pollutant, the text suggests that both gases are part of a complex interplay in atmospheric chemistry, particularly regarding their roles in the formation of ozone. However, the specific interactions between sulfur dioxide and ozone are not elaborated upon, indicating a more general relationship rather than a direct one."
