    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) are discussed in relation to their ambient concentrations and the effects of local photochemistry on their accumulation patterns. The study highlights how emissions from human activities, including SO2, influence the diurnal patterns of O3 concentrations, particularly in urban areas like Patras and Volos. However, the specific interactions between SO2 and O3 are not deeply explored, focusing instead on their respective roles in air quality and pollution dynamics."
