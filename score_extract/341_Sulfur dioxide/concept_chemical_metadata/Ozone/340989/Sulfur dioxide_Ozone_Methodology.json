    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) are both mentioned as environmental stressors related to emissions from power generation pathways. Sulfur dioxide is identified as a precursor to acid rain, while ozone is noted as a ground-level ozone precursor. However, the relationship between the two is not explicitly discussed, and they are presented more as components of broader environmental emissions rather than having a direct interaction or impact on each other."
