    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are mentioned as components of a mixture that was inhaled by birds, specifically American kestrels and Japanese quail. The study investigates the effects of this mixture on various physiological parameters, including EROD activity and plasma CORT concentrations. However, there is no direct discussion of the specific interactions or combined effects of sulfur dioxide and toluene on the birds' health or detoxification mechanisms, indicating a lack of detailed relationship between the two substances."
