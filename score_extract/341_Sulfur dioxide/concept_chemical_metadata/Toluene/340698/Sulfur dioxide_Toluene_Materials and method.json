    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are both mentioned as components of the exposure protocols for quail and kestrels. The birds were subjected to varying concentrations of these pollutants, along with other hydrocarbons like benzene. However, the relationship between SO2 and toluene is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup, indicating they are part of a broader study on the effects of air pollutants on avian health."
