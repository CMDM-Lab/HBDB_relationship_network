    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are both identified as air pollutants that may have immunotoxic effects on biota, specifically in birds. The study aims to investigate the impact of inhaled pollutants, including SO2 and toluene, on hepatic enzyme induction and stress responses in Japanese quail and American kestrels. While both pollutants are part of the same experimental framework, the specific interactions between SO2 and toluene are not detailed, indicating a shared relevance as air contaminants rather than a direct relationship."
