    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and toluene are both mentioned in relation to their exposure risks for asthmatics during pregnancy. While SO2 exposure is associated with risk reductions for non-asthmatics, toluene exposure is linked to significantly increased risks for asthmatics across various time windows. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and toluene is not directly discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of air quality and health impacts rather than having a direct interaction."
