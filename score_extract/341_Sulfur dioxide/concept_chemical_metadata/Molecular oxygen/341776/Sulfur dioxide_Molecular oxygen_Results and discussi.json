    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and molecular oxygen (O2) are indirectly related through their roles in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the formation and breakdown of ozone (O3). While sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned as a contributor to ozone formation, the discussion of molecular oxygen's involvement in the photochemical reactions that lead to ozone accumulation implies a broader context of air quality and pollutant interactions. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and O2 is not detailed, limiting the strength of their connection."
