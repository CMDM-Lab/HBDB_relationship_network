    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to esters, which are discussed in the context of wine fermentation by different yeast strains. The focus is on the production of various esters, such as ethyl octanoate and ethyl acetate, and their presence in wines from Southern and Northern Italy. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used in winemaking for preservation and preventing spoilage, its specific interaction with esters in this context is not addressed, indicating a lack of direct relevance."
