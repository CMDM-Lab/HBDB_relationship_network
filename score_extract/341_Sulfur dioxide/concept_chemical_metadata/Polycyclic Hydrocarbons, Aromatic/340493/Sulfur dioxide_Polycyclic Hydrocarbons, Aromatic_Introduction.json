    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are both mentioned as air pollutants that may have implications for health outcomes, particularly in relation to asthma and preeclampsia. However, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between sulfur dioxide and PAHs, focusing instead on their individual roles in air pollution and health risks during pregnancy. The study aims to explore the effects of various air pollutants, including PAHs and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), but does not specifically link sulfur dioxide to PAHs in the analysis."
