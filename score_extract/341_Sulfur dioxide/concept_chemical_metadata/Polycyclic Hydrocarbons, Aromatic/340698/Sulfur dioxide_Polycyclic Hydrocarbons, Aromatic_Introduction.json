    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are both mentioned in relation to the assessment of mixed function oxidases (MFOs) and cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) activity as biomarkers for xenobiotic exposure in wildlife. While sulfur dioxide is not directly linked to PAHs in the discussion, both are part of the broader context of environmental contaminants affecting animal health and detoxification processes. However, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and PAHs is not elaborated upon, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct interaction."
