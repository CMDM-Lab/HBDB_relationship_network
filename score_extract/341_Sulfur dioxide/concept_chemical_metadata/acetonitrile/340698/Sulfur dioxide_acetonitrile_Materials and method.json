    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and acetonitrile are both mentioned in relation to biotransformation enzyme activity assessments in hepatic tissue. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between sulfur dioxide and acetonitrile. Acetonitrile is used as a solvent in the fluorescence measurement process, while sulfur dioxide is not directly linked to the enzymatic activity being measured, indicating a lack of significant relevance between the two terms."
