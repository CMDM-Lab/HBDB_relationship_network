    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to ketones, which are identified as volatile compounds produced by different strains of S. cerevisiae in wine fermentation. The focus is on the production of ketones like 2-heptanone and 2-nonanone by these yeast strains, with no discussion of sulfur dioxide's role or interaction with ketones in the winemaking process. Therefore, while both terms are related to wine production, their connection is not explicitly established."
