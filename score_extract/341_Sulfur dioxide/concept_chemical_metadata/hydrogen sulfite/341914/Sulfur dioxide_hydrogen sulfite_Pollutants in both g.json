    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulfite (bisulfite) are related through their roles as water-soluble gases and weak acid solutes. The text discusses how SO2 can exist in gas phase and interact with solutions, potentially forming bisulfite in aqueous environments. This relationship highlights the chemical dynamics between these two compounds, particularly in the context of environmental chemistry and their behavior in ecosystems."
