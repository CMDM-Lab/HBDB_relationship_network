    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned in relation to 2-heptanone. The focus is on the production of various carbonyl compounds, including 2-heptanone, by different strains of S. cerevisiae in wine fermentation. While sulfur dioxide is commonly used as a preservative in winemaking, its specific interaction with 2-heptanone or its role in the fermentation process is not discussed, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms."
