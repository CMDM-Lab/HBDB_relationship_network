    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrocarbons are both pollutants included in the exposure protocols for quail and kestrels near a coal-fired power plant. The study examines the effects of these pollutants on the birds, with specific concentrations of hydrocarbons like benzene and toluene being administered alongside SO2. However, the relationship between SO2 and hydrocarbons is primarily as co-exposures rather than a direct interaction or metabolic relationship."
