    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methane are both mentioned as pollutants regulated under Turkish air quality standards. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. The focus is primarily on the limits set for SO2 and particulate matter (PM), with methane not being highlighted in terms of its impact or regulation in the same manner. Thus, while both are part of air quality considerations, their connection is not elaborated upon."
