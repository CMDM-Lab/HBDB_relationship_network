    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 4-xylene are both mentioned in relation to their exposure risks for asthmatics during pregnancy. While SO2 exposure is associated with risk reductions for non-asthmatics, 4-xylene, along with other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is linked to significantly increased risks for asthmatics. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and 4-xylene is not directly discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of air quality impacts on health rather than having a direct interaction."
