    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and sulfites are indirectly related through their roles as air pollutants and potential health risks, particularly in pregnant women. While SO2 exposure is discussed in relation to asthma and preeclampsia, sulfites are mentioned as particles that may also pose risks during pregnancy. However, the specific relationship between SO2 and sulfites is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
