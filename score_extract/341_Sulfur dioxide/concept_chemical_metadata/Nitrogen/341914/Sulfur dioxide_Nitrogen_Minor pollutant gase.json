    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are mentioned as components of atmospheric gases that interact with other pollutants, particularly nitrogen oxides (NOx). While both are recognized as traditional pollutants contributing to ozone production, the text does not elaborate on a direct relationship or specific interactions between sulfur dioxide and nitrogen. Their mention is more about their roles in atmospheric chemistry rather than a detailed connection."
