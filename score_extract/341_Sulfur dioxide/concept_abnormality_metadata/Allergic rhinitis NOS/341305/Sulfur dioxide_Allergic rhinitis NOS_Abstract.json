    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a pollutant associated with respiratory conditions in children, including asthma and allergic rhinitis. The study indicates a significant positive association between SO2 exposure and the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, suggesting that SO2 may contribute to the exacerbation of allergic responses in susceptible individuals. However, the specific relationship with allergic rhinitis NOS (not otherwise specified) is not detailed, indicating a broader connection rather than a direct one."
