    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is associated with various respiratory health outcomes, including allergic rhinitis. The data indicates that increased concentrations of SO2, along with other pollutants, correlate with a heightened risk of allergic rhinitis and other respiratory conditions in children. This suggests that SO2 exposure may contribute to the development or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis symptoms."
