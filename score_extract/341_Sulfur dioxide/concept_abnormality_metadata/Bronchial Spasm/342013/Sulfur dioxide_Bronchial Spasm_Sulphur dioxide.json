    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is directly linked to bronchial spasm, as exposure to SO2 above a threshold level (1000-2000 ppb) can induce bronchospasm in resting subjects. The relationship is further exacerbated during exercise, where increased SO2 penetration into the airways leads to heightened bronchial response. This indicates a clear and significant impact of SO2 on respiratory function, particularly in vulnerable individuals."
