    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as part of a broader study on air pollutant exposures, but there is no direct discussion linking SO2 to obesity. The focus is primarily on maternal health factors and air quality modeling, without establishing a clear relationship between SO2 exposure and obesity outcomes. Thus, while both terms are present, their connection is not explored."
