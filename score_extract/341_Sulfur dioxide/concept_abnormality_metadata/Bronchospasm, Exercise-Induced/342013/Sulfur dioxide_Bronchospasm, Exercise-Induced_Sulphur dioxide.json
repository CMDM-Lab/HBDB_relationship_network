    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a significant irritant for individuals with asthma, particularly during exercise, potentially triggering exercise-induced bronchospasm. The text suggests that while SO2 poses a risk for asthmatic athletes, it is less concerning for those with normal lung function. The relationship indicates that SO2 exposure can exacerbate bronchospasm symptoms in susceptible individuals during physical activity."
