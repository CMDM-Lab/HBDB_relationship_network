    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed for its long-term exposure effects on children's health outcomes, including rhinoconjunctivitis. While the study indicates a correlation between air pollution and respiratory symptoms, it does not provide specific evidence linking SO2 exposure directly to the incidence or severity of rhinoconjunctivitis. The relationship is implied through the broader context of air quality and allergic conditions."
