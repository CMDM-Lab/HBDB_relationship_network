    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned in relation to bacterial shell rot. The focus is on the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) by yeast strains during fermentation, which may have implications for spoilage or off-flavors in wine. However, there is no explicit connection made between sulfur dioxide and bacterial shell rot, which typically refers to a disease affecting fruits or vegetables caused by bacteria. Thus, the relationship remains unclear and indirect."
