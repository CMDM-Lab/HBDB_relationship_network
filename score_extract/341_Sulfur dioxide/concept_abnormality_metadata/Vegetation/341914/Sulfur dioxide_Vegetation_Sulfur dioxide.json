    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its historical impact on vegetation, particularly through its role in acid deposition. While the acute and chronic damage from SO2 to vegetation has decreased in industrialized areas, the ongoing effects of sulfate deposition in remote regions have led to ecological challenges, including the loss of biota in freshwater systems. This indicates a complex relationship where SO2 emissions have both direct and indirect effects on vegetation health and ecosystem stability."
