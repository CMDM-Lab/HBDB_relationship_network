    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is associated with an increased risk of eczema, particularly in relation to lifetime asthma and other respiratory conditions. The data indicates that higher concentrations of SO2, along with other pollutants like benzene and PM10, correlate with a greater incidence of eczema among children. This suggests a potential link between SO2 exposure and the exacerbation of eczema symptoms, highlighting the impact of air quality on skin health."
