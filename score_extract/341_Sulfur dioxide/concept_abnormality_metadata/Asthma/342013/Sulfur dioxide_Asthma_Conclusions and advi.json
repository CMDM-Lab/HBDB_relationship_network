    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as an irritant that poses a risk to individuals with asthma, particularly during exercise. While it may not significantly affect athletes with normal lung function, it can exacerbate symptoms in asthmatic athletes, highlighting the need for them to manage their condition proactively, such as using inhalers before exercise. This indicates a direct relationship between SO2 exposure and asthma exacerbation."
