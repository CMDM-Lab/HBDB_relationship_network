    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a potential concern for athletes, particularly those with asthma. While ambient levels of SO2 are generally considered too low to pose a risk to healthy individuals, asthmatic athletes may experience detrimental effects from exposure. This highlights a specific vulnerability of asthmatic individuals to SO2, suggesting a direct relationship between the pollutant and asthma exacerbation during exercise."
