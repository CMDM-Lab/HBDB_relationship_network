    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a significant irritant that can trigger asthma symptoms, particularly in exercising individuals. The release of histamine from mast cells in response to SO2 leads to bronchoconstriction and increased airway resistance, which are critical factors in asthma exacerbation. The text suggests that SO2 may contribute to exercise-induced bronchospasm, highlighting its relevance to asthma management and the potential risks for asthmatic athletes."
