    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure is associated with increased risks for asthmatics during pregnancy. The study indicates that asthmatics face significantly elevated risks (10%) related to SO2 exposure, particularly in the context of other pollutants. This suggests a potential exacerbation of asthma symptoms or complications due to SO2, highlighting its relevance in respiratory health during pregnancy."
