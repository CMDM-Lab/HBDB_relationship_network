    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is linked to asthma through its association with increased risks of preeclampsia in asthmatic women. The study indicates that first trimester exposure to SO2, along with other pollutants, correlates with higher preeclampsia risks among asthmatic women compared to non-asthmatics. This suggests that SO2 exposure may exacerbate health risks in individuals with asthma during pregnancy, highlighting its potential impact on respiratory health and pregnancy outcomes."
