    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the air pollutants studied for its interaction with maternal asthma and its potential impact on preeclampsia risk. The findings suggest that women with asthma may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution, including SO2 exposure, although the specific relationship between SO2 and asthma is not deeply explored. The study indicates that while most criteria air pollutants showed no significant effect on preeclampsia risk, SO2 and NOx were noted for their interactions with maternal asthma, warranting further investigation."
