    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a significant air pollutant positively associated with asthma in children. The study highlights that children exposed to SO2, along with other pollutants like benzene and PM10, exhibited higher rates of asthma, indicating a potential link between SO2 exposure and respiratory health issues. This suggests that SO2 may contribute to the exacerbation of asthma symptoms or the development of asthma in susceptible populations."
