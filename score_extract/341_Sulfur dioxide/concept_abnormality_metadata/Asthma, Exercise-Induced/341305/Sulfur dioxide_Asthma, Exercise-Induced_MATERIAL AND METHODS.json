    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to exercise-induced asthma (EIA) through the broader investigation of asthma prevalence and risk factors in children. The study examines respiratory diseases and their associations with air quality, where sulfur dioxide is a known air pollutant that can exacerbate asthma symptoms, including EIA. However, the specific impact of sulfur dioxide on EIA is not directly addressed in the provided context."
