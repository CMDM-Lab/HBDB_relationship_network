    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure during the first trimester is associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, particularly among asthmatic women. This finding is novel, as SO2 has not been previously studied in relation to pre-eclampsia alone. The study indicates that air pollutants, including SO2, may contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, highlighting the importance of environmental factors in maternal health."
