    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a criteria air pollutant being examined for its potential relationship with pre-eclampsia. However, the study primarily focuses on the interactions of other pollutants like NOx, O3, and PAHs with pre-eclampsia risk, without providing specific evidence or discussion regarding sulfur dioxide's direct impact on pre-eclampsia. Thus, while both terms are included in the broader investigation of air pollution and pregnancy outcomes, their direct relationship remains unclear."
