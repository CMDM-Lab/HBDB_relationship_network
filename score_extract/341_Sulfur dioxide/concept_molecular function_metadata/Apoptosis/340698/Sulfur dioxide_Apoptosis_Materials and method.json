    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not explicitly mentioned in relation to apoptosis. The study focuses on assessing cell density and apoptosis in the bursa of Fabricius of quail, but does not provide any direct evidence or discussion linking sulfur dioxide exposure to the apoptotic processes being evaluated. Therefore, while both terms are relevant to cellular biology, their relationship is not established in this context."
