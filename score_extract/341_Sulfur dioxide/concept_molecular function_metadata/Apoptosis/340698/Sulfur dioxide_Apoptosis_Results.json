    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to a study examining its effects alongside other pollutants on avian species. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with apoptosis. The study notes no significant differences in the degree of apoptosis in the medulla of the bursa of Fabricius among treatment groups, indicating that SO2 exposure did not lead to observable apoptotic changes in the examined tissues of the quail."
