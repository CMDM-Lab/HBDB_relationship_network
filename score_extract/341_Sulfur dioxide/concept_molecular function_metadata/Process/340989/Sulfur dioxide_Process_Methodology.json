    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as a part of any specific process but is likely a byproduct of the processes involved in coal production, processing, and combustion. The study focuses on the life cycle of power generation pathways, which includes various unit processes, but does not detail the role or impact of sulfur dioxide within these processes. Therefore, while sulfur dioxide is relevant to the broader context of emissions from coal-related processes, its specific relationship to the processes described is not directly addressed."
