    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to the fermentation process involving different strains of S. cerevisiae. While the analysis focuses on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during fermentation, sulfur dioxide is commonly used as a preservative and antioxidant in winemaking. However, the specific role of sulfur dioxide in the fermentation process is not explicitly discussed, limiting the depth of the relationship."
