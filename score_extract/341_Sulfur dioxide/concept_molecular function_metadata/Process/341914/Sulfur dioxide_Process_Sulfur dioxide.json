    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to various atmospheric processes that influence its transport, reaction, and deposition. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding these processes for developing effective emission reduction strategies. However, while SO2 is central to the discussion, the term 'process' is used broadly to refer to the various mechanisms involved, without detailing specific interactions or implications directly tied to SO2."
