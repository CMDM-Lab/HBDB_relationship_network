    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes and conversion to sulfate, which are influenced by various environmental factors such as ozone concentration and photochemical reactions. The study highlights how these processes vary between the cities of Volos and Patras, indicating that the levels of SO2 are affected by urban activities and atmospheric conditions, thus linking SO2 to specific processes of atmospheric chemistry and pollution dynamics."
