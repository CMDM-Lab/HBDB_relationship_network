    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is described as part of a synergistic interaction with PM10 and water vapor, which enhances the formation of sulfuric acid when these components are present together in the air. This synergism is significant enough to influence regulatory standards for SO2 levels based on particulate matter concentrations, indicating a critical relationship between SO2 and its synergistic effects on air quality and health outcomes."
