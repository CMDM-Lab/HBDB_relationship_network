    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its irritative effects on the respiratory system. NO2 exposure leads to symptoms such as pharyngeal irritation and cough, which are similar to the known effects of sulfur dioxide. Both gases are irritants that can affect respiratory health, suggesting a potential parallel in their irritative properties, although sulfur dioxide is not explicitly linked in this excerpt."
