    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its oxidant properties. NO2 is highlighted for its ability to act as an oxidant, causing respiratory issues and impairing resistance to infections. While sulfur dioxide is also an oxidant, the context does not establish a direct relationship between sulfur dioxide and oxidants, focusing instead on NO2's effects on health."
