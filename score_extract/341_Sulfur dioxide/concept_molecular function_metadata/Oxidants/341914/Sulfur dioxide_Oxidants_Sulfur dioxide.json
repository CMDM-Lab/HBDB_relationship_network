    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its atmospheric chemistry and the conversion to sulfate, which involves oxidants. The removal of oxidant limitation during the atmospheric transport of SO2 is highlighted as a factor influencing sulfate deposition. This indicates a significant relationship where oxidants play a crucial role in the oxidation process of SO2, affecting environmental outcomes such as acidification and ecological impacts."
