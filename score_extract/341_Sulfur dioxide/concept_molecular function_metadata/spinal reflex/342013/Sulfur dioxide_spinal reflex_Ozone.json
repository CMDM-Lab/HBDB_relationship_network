    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around lung function and the effects of inhaled irritants like ozone on respiratory mechanics. The spinal reflex is referenced in relation to the inhibition of inspiratory muscle contraction via non-myelinated C fiber afferent nerves. While both terms relate to respiratory physiology, there is no explicit connection between sulfur dioxide and spinal reflexes in the provided context."
