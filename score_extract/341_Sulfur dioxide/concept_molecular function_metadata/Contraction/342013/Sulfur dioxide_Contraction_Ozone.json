    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to contraction through its effects on lung function and respiratory mechanics. The inhalation of irritants like SO2 can lead to inflammation and increased airway resistance, which may contribute to the contraction of smooth muscles in the airways. This contraction can limit inspiratory capacity and affect overall lung function, particularly during exercise, as indicated by the decrements in lung measurements with increased exercise intensity."
