    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on respiratory health, particularly persistent inflammation in the airways. While SO2 is known to cause respiratory issues and inflammation, the specific relationship between SO2 and persistent inflammation is not explored in detail here. The focus is primarily on NO2 and its impact on airway resistance and inflammation, suggesting a broader context of air quality and respiratory health rather than a direct link to sulfur dioxide."
