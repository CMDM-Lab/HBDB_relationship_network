    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around carbon monoxide (CO) and its detrimental effects on blood circulation and athletic performance. CO binds to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery to tissues, which necessitates increased heart rate and cardiac output. While sulfur dioxide is a known air pollutant that can affect respiratory health, its direct relationship with blood circulation is not addressed in this context, making the connection indirect and speculative."
