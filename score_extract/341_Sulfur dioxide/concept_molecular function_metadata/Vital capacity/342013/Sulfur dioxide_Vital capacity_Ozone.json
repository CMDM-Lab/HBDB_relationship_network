    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to vital capacity as both are discussed in the broader context of pulmonary function and air quality. While the text primarily focuses on ozone (O3) and its effects on lung function, it implies that exposure to pollutants like SO2 can also impact vital capacity. However, there is no direct evidence or specific data linking SO2 levels to changes in vital capacity within the provided context."
