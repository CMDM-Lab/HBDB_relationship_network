    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is linked to long-term effects observed in passerine birds exposed to emissions from a coal-fired power plant. The study reports that these birds exhibited significant respiratory changes, such as excessive mucus and shorter cilia in their tracheas after prolonged exposure to SO2, indicating detrimental long-term health impacts from the contaminant."
