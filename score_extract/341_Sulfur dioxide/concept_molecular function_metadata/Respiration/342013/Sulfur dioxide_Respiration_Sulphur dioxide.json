    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its effects on respiration, particularly lung function. Exposure to SO2 at levels above the threshold can lead to bronchospasm in resting individuals and increased mucociliary clearance during exercise. This indicates that SO2 directly impacts respiratory function, especially under physical exertion, highlighting its relevance to respiratory health and defense mechanisms against pollutants."
