    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is implied as a reactive gas that can affect respiration, particularly in endurance athletes exposed to air pollution. The discussion highlights how inhaled gases, including pollutants like SO2, can impair respiratory functions such as mucociliary clearance, which is crucial for maintaining respiratory health. The relationship suggests that exposure to sulfur dioxide may negatively impact respiratory efficiency and overall lung function during strenuous exercise."
