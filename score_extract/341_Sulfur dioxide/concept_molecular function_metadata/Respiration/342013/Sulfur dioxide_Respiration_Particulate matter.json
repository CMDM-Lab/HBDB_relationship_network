    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide is indirectly related to respiration through the discussion of airborne particulate matter and its health effects. The text highlights how increased airflow during exercise can lead to deeper inhalation of pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, which may bypass normal nasal filtration. This suggests a potential impact of sulfur dioxide on respiratory health, particularly during physical activity, although the specific effects of sulfur dioxide on respiration are not explicitly detailed."
