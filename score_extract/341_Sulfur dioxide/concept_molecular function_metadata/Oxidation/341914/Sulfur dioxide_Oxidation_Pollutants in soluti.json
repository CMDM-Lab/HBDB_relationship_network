    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a traditional pollutant, but its specific relationship with oxidation is not directly addressed. The text discusses the environmental interactions of various pollutants, including SO2, but does not elaborate on how oxidation processes specifically relate to SO2 or its effects on plants. The focus is more on the broader environmental impact of pollutants rather than a detailed interaction between SO2 and oxidation."
