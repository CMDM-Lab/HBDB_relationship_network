    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes in urban air photochemistry. The oxidation of SO2 is a critical step in its conversion to particulate sulfate, which contributes to air pollution and has significant environmental and health impacts. This highlights the importance of oxidation in the atmospheric chemistry of sulfur dioxide and its role in forming secondary pollutants."
