    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes, particularly its conversion to sulfate (SO4^2-) under the influence of solar radiation and higher ozone concentrations. The study highlights how the oxidation of SO2 varies between the cities of Volos and Patras, with higher ozone levels in Volos contributing to a greater conversion ratio of SO2 to sulfate. This indicates a significant relationship where oxidation plays a crucial role in the atmospheric behavior of sulfur dioxide."
