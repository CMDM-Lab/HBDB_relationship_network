    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to air quality measurements and regulatory standards set by Turkish regulations for air quality protection. The data indicates that SO2 levels in major cities were above these limits prior to 1992-1993, highlighting the importance of regulation in managing air quality and reducing pollution levels over time. The improvement in air quality by 1996 suggests that regulatory measures may have been effective in controlling SO2 emissions."
