    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to fermentation through its role in winemaking, where it is often used as an antimicrobial agent to control unwanted microbial activity during the fermentation process. The study discusses the selection of yeast strains for alcoholic fermentation, emphasizing the importance of strain-specific characteristics in producing desirable volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as a direct factor in the fermentation process, its relevance lies in its common use in managing fermentation conditions and preserving wine quality."
