    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not explicitly mentioned, but it is commonly used in winemaking to inhibit unwanted microbial growth and oxidation during fermentation. The study focuses on the fermentation process of various S. cerevisiae yeast strains isolated from different grape varieties, assessing their ability to produce volatile aromatic compounds. While SO2 plays a crucial role in fermentation, its specific relationship with the fermentation process in this study is not directly addressed."
