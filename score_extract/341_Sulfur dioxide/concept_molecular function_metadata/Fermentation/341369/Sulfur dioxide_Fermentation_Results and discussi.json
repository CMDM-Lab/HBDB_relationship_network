    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to the technological characterization of S. cerevisiae strains used in wine fermentation. The strains exhibited high resistance to SO2, which is a common additive in winemaking to prevent spoilage and oxidation. The study highlights the importance of SO2 tolerance in selecting yeast strains for fermentation, indicating a significant relationship between SO2 and the fermentation process."
