    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on neutrophilic inflammation in the airways. The mention of neutrophilic inflammation suggests a potential relationship with respiratory irritants like SO2, which can also contribute to airway inflammation. However, the specific connection between SO2 and neutrophilic responses is not explicitly established in the provided text."
