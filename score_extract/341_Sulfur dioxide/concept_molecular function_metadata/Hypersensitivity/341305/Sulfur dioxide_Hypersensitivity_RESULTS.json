    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the urban pollutants associated with increased risks of asthma and hypersensitivity in children. The study indicates that children living in areas with higher concentrations of SO2, along with other pollutants, have a significantly higher risk of developing asthma and allergic conditions, suggesting a direct link between SO2 exposure and hypersensitivity responses in susceptible populations."
