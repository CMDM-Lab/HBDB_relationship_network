    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to hypersensitivity through its association with urban air pollution and respiratory conditions like asthma and allergies. While sulfur dioxide is not explicitly mentioned as a direct cause of hypersensitivity, the broader discussion of air pollutants, including particulate matter and volatile organic compounds, suggests a potential link to increased sensitivity and allergic responses in children exposed to these pollutants over time."
