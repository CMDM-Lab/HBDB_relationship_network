    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to an inhalation chamber used for exposure trials on birds. While the study involves measuring physiological responses, including potential impacts on inspiration function, there is no direct discussion of how sulfur dioxide specifically affects the inspiration function of the birds. The focus is more on the experimental setup rather than a clear relationship between SO2 and respiratory function."
