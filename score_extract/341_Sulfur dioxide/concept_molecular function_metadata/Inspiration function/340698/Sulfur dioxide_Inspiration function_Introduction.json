    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a major air pollutant that may impact the respiratory function of birds, specifically Japanese quail and American kestrels. The study aims to investigate the effects of inhaled pollutants, including SO2, on stress and immune responses, which are closely linked to the inspiration function of these birds. The unique respiratory anatomy of birds makes them particularly sensitive to such pollutants, suggesting a potential relationship between SO2 exposure and alterations in their inspiration function."
