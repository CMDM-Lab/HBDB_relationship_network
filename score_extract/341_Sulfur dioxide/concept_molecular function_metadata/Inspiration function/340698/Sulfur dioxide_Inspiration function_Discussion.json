    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its inhalation effects on hepatic and lung enzyme activities, specifically CYP 450. While the study highlights the impact of SO2 on enzyme function, it does not directly address its relationship with inspiration function. The focus is primarily on biochemical responses rather than respiratory mechanics or inspiration function itself."
