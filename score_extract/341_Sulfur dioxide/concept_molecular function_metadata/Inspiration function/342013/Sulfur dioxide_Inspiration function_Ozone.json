    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to inspiration function through its impact on lung measurements and respiratory mechanics. The text discusses how various factors, including inhaled irritants like SO2, can lead to decreased inspiratory capacity, increased flow resistance, and overall impaired lung function. While SO2 is not explicitly mentioned, the implications of inhaled pollutants on respiratory function are evident, suggesting a potential negative effect on inspiration."
