    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its effects on lung function, particularly during inspiration. The gas can cause bronchospasm when inhaled at concentrations above 1000-2000 ppb, with increased penetration into the lungs during exercise due to a shift from nasal to oral breathing. This highlights the detrimental impact of SO2 on respiratory function, especially during physical activity, indicating a direct relationship between SO2 exposure and inspiration function."
