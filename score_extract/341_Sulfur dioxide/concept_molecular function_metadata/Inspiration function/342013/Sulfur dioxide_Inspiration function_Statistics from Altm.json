    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to air pollution and its potential effects on respiratory function, particularly in endurance athletes. The text highlights how exposure to pollutants like SO2 can impair mucociliary clearance, which is crucial for maintaining proper inspiration function. The relationship suggests that increased SO2 levels may negatively impact the ability to inspire effectively, especially during strenuous exercise when respiratory demands are heightened."
