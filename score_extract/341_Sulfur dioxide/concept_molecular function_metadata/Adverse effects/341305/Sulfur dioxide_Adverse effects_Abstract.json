    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as a significant air pollutant that has decreased in concentration since 1980, while other traffic-related air pollutants have increased. The adverse effects of long-term exposure to these pollutants, including SO2, on respiratory conditions like asthma and allergies are discussed, indicating a potential link between air quality and health outcomes. However, the relationship remains unclear and inconsistent across studies, suggesting that while SO2 is implicated in adverse health effects, the evidence is not definitive."
