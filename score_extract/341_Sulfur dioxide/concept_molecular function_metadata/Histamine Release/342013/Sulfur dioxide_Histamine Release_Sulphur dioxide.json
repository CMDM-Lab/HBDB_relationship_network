    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is identified as a respiratory irritant that stimulates histamine release from mast cells in respiratory tissues. This histamine release contributes to symptoms such as wheezing and chest tightness, particularly in individuals with asthma. The relationship is significant as histamine plays a crucial role in bronchoconstriction and airway resistance, which are exacerbated by SO2 exposure. Treatments like cromolyn sodium can block histamine release, highlighting the direct connection between SO2 and histamine-mediated respiratory responses."
