    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly mentioned in relation to pressure as a physical agent. The discussion focuses on ozone (O3) levels and their seasonal variations influenced by high-pressure systems. While pressure can affect the dispersion and concentration of pollutants like SO2, there is no explicit connection made between sulfur dioxide and pressure in the provided text."
