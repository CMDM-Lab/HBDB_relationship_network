    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide exposure is assessed for its impact on immune function in kestrels and quails. While the study measures immune responses, such as T cell activity via the PHA skin test, the results indicate no significant differences in immune function between control and exposed groups. This suggests that sulfur dioxide may not have a direct or measurable effect on immunologic function in the tested birds."
