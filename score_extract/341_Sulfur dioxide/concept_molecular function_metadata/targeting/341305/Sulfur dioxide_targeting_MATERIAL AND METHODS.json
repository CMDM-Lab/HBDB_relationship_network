    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned as one of the major urban air pollutants assessed for long-term exposure among children. The term 'targeting' refers to the methods used to estimate air pollutant concentrations at school addresses through the STREET software, which models both regional and local pollution sources. While SO2 is part of the pollutants being targeted for assessment, there is no direct relationship established between SO2 and the concept of targeting beyond its inclusion in the air quality evaluation process."
