    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to its role in particulate pollution and its effects on respiratory health. While the term 'drug interactions' is not explicitly mentioned, the implications of SO2 exposure could suggest potential interactions with respiratory medications or treatments. However, the context primarily focuses on environmental health rather than pharmacological interactions, leading to a lack of direct relevance between SO2 and drug interactions."
