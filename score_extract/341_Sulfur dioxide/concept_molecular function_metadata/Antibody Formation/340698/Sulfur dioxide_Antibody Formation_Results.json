    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide and antibody formation are mentioned in relation to a study involving kestrels and quails. However, there is no direct discussion or evidence linking sulfur dioxide exposure to changes in antibody formation. The statistical analyses presented do not indicate any significant differences in antibody responses among the groups studied, suggesting a lack of relationship between the two terms in this specific context."
