    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is mentioned in relation to an experimental design involving birds exposed to various gas mixtures, including inhalation trials. While blood samples were collected to assess antibody responses, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide exposure and antibody formation is not directly discussed. The context primarily focuses on the methodology of exposure and sample collection rather than detailing any immunological effects of sulfur dioxide on antibody production."
