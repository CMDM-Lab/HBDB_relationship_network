    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is discussed in relation to air quality standards and its concentrations in the atmosphere, particularly in comparison to other pollutants like NO2 and O3. However, there is no mention of 'adjudication' or any direct relationship between SO2 and adjudication processes. The focus is primarily on pollutant levels and meteorological factors affecting air quality, with no clear connection to adjudication."
