    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is not directly linked to myelination. The discussion focuses on lung function and the effects of inhaled irritants, particularly in relation to non-myelinated C fiber afferent nerves. While myelination is crucial for nerve function, the context does not establish a clear relationship between SO2 exposure and myelination processes."
