    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to the evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the fermentation process of grape must by Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. While the study focuses on the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and CO2 evolution, sulfur dioxide is not explicitly discussed in terms of its role or impact on the evolutionary processes of the yeast or the fermentation dynamics. Thus, the relationship is more about the fermentation environment rather than a direct connection between sulfur dioxide and evolutionary processes."
