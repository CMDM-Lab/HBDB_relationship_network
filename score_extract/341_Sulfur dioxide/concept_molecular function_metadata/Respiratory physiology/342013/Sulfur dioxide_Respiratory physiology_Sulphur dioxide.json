    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is directly linked to respiratory physiology, particularly in the effects it has on asthmatic individuals during exercise. Exposure to SO2 leads to significant changes in airway resistance and lung function, evidenced by decreased FEV1 and symptoms such as wheezing and dyspnea. The physiological response includes histamine release and smooth muscle contraction, which are critical aspects of respiratory physiology. Treatments like Î²2 adrenergic agonists can reverse these effects, highlighting the importance of understanding SO2's impact on respiratory health."
