    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is indirectly related to respiratory physiology through its potential effects on pulmonary function. While the text primarily discusses ozone (O3) and its impact on lung function, it implies that indoor air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, can pose serious risks to respiratory health, particularly in poorly ventilated environments. However, the specific relationship between sulfur dioxide and respiratory physiology is not explicitly detailed."
