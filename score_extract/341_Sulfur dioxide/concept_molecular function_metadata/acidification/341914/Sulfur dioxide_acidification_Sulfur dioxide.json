    "summary": "In this context, sulfur dioxide (SO2) is linked to acidification through its role in sulfate deposition, which contributes to freshwater acidification. The text discusses how SO2 emissions have historically affected vegetation and how sulfate deposition processes, particularly wet deposition, influence acidification trends in various regions. The relationship is evident as SO2 emissions lead to sulfate formation, which is a key factor in acidifying freshwater ecosystems."
