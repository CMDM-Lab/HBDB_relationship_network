    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to enzyme activity through the role of isoprene synthase (ISPS). The study indicates that increased temperatures enhance ISPS enzyme activity, leading to higher isoprene emissions from plants. This relationship suggests that enzyme activity is a critical factor in the biosynthesis of isoprene, particularly under conditions of temperature stress and drought."
