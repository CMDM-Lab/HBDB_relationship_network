    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor to isoprene, is discussed in relation to its environmental impacts, particularly concerning plant stress responses and air quality. The study highlights the potential for biotechnological approaches to reduce isoprene emissions from poplar plantations, which could mitigate negative effects on local air quality and human health. However, the direct relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and environmental impacts is not deeply explored, focusing instead on broader implications of isoprene emissions."
