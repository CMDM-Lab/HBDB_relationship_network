    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its ambient concentrations and their impact on ozone formation processes. The text highlights how varying levels of isoprene influence the chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the subsequent production of ozone. However, the term 'Process' is too vague and does not specify a particular mechanism or pathway, making the relationship less direct."
