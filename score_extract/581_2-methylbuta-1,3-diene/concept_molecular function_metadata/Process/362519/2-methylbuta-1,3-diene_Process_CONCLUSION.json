    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to the process of fruit abscission. The signaling pathways involving hormones like ABA and ethylene are crucial for initiating the abscission process, with isoprene potentially playing a role in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activating secondary signaling pathways. This indicates that isoprene production is part of the broader physiological process of abscission induction in fruit development."
