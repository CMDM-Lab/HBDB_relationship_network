    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its role in various biological processes, particularly in response to abiotic stresses in plants. The text highlights isoprene's antioxidant properties and its involvement in signaling pathways that may affect processes such as the hypersensitive response and gene regulation. However, the term 'Process' is too vague and does not specify a particular biological or chemical process, making the relationship less direct."
