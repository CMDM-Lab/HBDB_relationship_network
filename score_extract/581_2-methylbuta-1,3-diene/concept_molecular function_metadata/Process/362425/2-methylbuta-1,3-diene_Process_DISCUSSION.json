    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from plants during abiotic stress conditions such as drought and heat. The process refers to the physiological and metabolic responses of plants, particularly how isoprene emission may enhance stress tolerance and affect photosynthetic processes. However, the specific mechanisms or processes involving 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene are not elaborated in detail, indicating a general connection rather than a direct interaction."
