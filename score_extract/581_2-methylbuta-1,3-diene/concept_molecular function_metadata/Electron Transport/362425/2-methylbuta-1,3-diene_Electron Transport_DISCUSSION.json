    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is indirectly related to electron transport through its role in enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance of photosynthetic processes. The study discusses how isoprene-emitting plants maintain electron transport rates (ETR) better than non-emitting (NE) plants under stress conditions, suggesting that isoprene may help sustain electron flow in the chloroplasts during adverse environmental conditions. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the effects of stress on electron transport components rather than a direct interaction with isoprene itself."
