    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned alongside various physiological parameters including transpiration rates in poplar plants. The study examines how isoprene emission relates to gas exchange processes, including transpiration, under different environmental scenarios. While both terms are part of the broader discussion on plant physiology, the specific interaction between isoprene emission and transpiration is not explicitly detailed, indicating a moderate connection."
