    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, is mentioned alongside transpiration, a physiological process in plants. While the study discusses the relationship between environmental conditions and isoprene emissions, it does not provide a direct link between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and transpiration. Instead, it highlights the broader context of plant responses to climate scenarios, suggesting that transpiration may influence VOC emissions but lacks specific details on their interaction."
