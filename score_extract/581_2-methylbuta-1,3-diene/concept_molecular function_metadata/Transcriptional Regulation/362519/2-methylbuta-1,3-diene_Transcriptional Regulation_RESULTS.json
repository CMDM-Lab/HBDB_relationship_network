    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound related to isoprene emissions, is indirectly linked to transcriptional regulation mechanisms associated with secondary metabolism in fruitlets. The study focuses on how transcriptional regulation may influence isoprene emission and ABA content, suggesting that the expression of certain genes related to terpenoids and other pathways is affected during abscission induction. However, the specific role of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene in transcriptional regulation is not explicitly detailed."
