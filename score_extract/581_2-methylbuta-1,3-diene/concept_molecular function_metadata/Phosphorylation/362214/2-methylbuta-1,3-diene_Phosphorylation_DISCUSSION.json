    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is indirectly related to phosphorylation through the discussion of deoxyribose (DOX) and its incorporation into isoprenoids. The rapid labeling of isoprene emission suggests a link to the phosphorylation of DOX, which may be catalyzed by xylulose kinase. However, the relationship between isoprene and phosphorylation is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the metabolic pathway involving DOX."
