    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves and the regulation of the MEP pathway that supplies DMAPP, a substrate for isoprene synthesis. The study highlights the regulatory mechanisms that control isoprene production, particularly under conditions of carbon starvation and heat stress, indicating a significant relationship between isoprene emission and its regulatory pathways."
