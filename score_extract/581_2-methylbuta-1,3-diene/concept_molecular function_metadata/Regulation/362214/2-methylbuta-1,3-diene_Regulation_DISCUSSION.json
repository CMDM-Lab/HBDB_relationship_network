    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound (isoprene), is discussed in relation to its emission regulation following heat stress in leaves. The regulation of isoprene emission is influenced by substrate availability rather than changes in isoprene synthase activity. This indicates a significant relationship between the compound's emission and regulatory mechanisms under environmental stress conditions."
