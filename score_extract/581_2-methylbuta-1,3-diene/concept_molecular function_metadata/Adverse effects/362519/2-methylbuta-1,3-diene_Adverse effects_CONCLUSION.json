    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its role in the signaling pathways involved in fruit abscission. While the text mentions isoprene's potential involvement in detoxification from reactive oxygen species (ROS), it does not explicitly detail any adverse effects associated with isoprene or its production. The relationship is more about its signaling role rather than direct adverse effects."
