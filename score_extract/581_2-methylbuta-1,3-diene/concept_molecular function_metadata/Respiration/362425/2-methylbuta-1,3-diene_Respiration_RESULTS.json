    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned in relation to gas exchange measurements in plants, specifically regarding its emission rate during photosynthesis and respiration processes. The study examines how isoprene emission correlates with various physiological parameters, including mitochondrial respiration in the dark. However, the direct relationship between isoprene and respiration is not explicitly detailed, indicating a broader context of plant physiological responses rather than a focused interaction."
