    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is linked to respiration as a potential contributor to its biosynthesis in apple fruitlets. The text suggests that isoprene production may be supported by starch degradation and respiration processes, particularly following sucrose breakdown. This indicates a metabolic relationship where respiration plays a role in providing substrates for isoprene biosynthesis, especially under nutritional stress conditions."
