    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by vegetation, is indirectly related to the concept of feedback in climate change. The reduction of isoprene emissions, which includes 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, could enhance carbon uptake by vegetation and mitigate the negative effects of ozone on plants. This interaction suggests a potential feedback mechanism where changes in VOC emissions influence climate dynamics and carbon cycling, although the relationship is not explicitly detailed."
