    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is involved in a feedback loop regulating its own emission. The feedback mechanism is highlighted as effective, with changes in isoprene production linked to the activity of isoprene synthase and the regulation of DXS. The feedback loop plays a crucial role in controlling the carbon flow towards isoprene synthesis, particularly under varying temperature conditions."
