    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not explicitly mentioned, but the study focuses on the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of control and chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats. The relationship between exhalation and the presence of various VOCs, including isoprene and aldehydes, is highlighted, indicating that exhalation is a key method for detecting these compounds. However, without specific mention of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, its direct relevance to exhalation remains unclear."
