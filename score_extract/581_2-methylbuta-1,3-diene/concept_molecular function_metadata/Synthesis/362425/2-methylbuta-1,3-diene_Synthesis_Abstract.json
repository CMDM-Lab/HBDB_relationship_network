    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in plants. The synthesis of isoprene is influenced by various environmental factors, including light, temperature, and CO2 levels. The text highlights the biochemical processes involved in isoprene production, indicating its significance in plant metabolism and its implications for atmospheric chemistry and climate. However, the synthesis process itself is not detailed extensively, focusing more on the conditions affecting isoprene emission rather than the specific synthetic pathways."
