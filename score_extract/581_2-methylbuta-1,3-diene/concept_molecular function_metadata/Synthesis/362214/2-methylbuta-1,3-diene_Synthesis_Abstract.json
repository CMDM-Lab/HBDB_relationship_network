    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is discussed in relation to its synthesis from DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through the action of isoprene synthase. The study investigates the regulation of the MEP pathway that supplies DMAPP for isoprene synthesis, particularly under conditions of carbon starvation and heat stress. The synthesis process is highlighted through the labeling of emitted isoprene with deuterium, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its synthesis pathway."
