    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is identified as a byproduct of cholesterol biosynthesis. The synthesis of isoprene occurs from mevalonate, a product of the cholesterol synthesis pathway catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. The relationship highlights how cholesterol metabolism directly influences isoprene production, linking the two processes in physiological contexts."
