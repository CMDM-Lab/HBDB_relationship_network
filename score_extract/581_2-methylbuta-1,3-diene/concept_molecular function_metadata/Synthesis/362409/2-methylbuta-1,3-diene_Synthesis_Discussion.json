    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a monoterpene, is discussed in relation to its emission from flowering plants, particularly deciduous trees. The synthesis of monoterpenes like 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is influenced by environmental factors such as light and temperature, similar to isoprene emissions. The study highlights the synthesis of these compounds as a response to environmental controls, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and its synthesis process."
