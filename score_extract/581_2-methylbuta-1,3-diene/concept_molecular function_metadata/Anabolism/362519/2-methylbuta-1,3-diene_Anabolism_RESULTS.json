    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to anabolism through its role in isoprenoid biosynthesis, which is a metabolic pathway involving anabolic processes. The expression of DXS genes, which are crucial for the synthesis of isoprenoids, suggests that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may be a product or intermediate in anabolic pathways related to plant metabolism, particularly during fruit development. However, the specific connection to anabolism is not explicitly detailed."
