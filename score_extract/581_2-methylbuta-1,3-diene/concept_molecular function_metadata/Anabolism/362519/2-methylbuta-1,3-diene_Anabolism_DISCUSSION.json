    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor for isoprene biosynthesis, is indirectly related to anabolism through its role in the metabolic pathway involving dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). The up-regulation of genes like DXS enhances the availability of DMAPP, which is crucial for both isoprene production and other anabolic pathways, including the synthesis of carotenoids and ABA. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the metabolic processes rather than a direct connection to anabolism itself."
