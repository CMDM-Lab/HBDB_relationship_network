    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emission rates, which are influenced by biosynthesis processes that depend on environmental factors like temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). While the term 'anabolism' is not explicitly mentioned, the biosynthesis of isoprene suggests a connection to anabolic processes, as it involves the synthesis of organic compounds from simpler precursors. However, the relationship is not deeply explored or quantified in the provided context."
