    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to the term 'analyte' as it is a type of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that may be measured in studies involving leaf cuvettes designed for photosynthesis and BVOC emission measurements. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the term 'analyte' is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is more on the general properties of BVOCs and the challenges in measuring them rather than on 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene as a specific analyte of interest."
