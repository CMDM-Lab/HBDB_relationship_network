    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is analyzed using a proton transfer time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) to monitor its concentrations. The ionization process is crucial for detecting isoprene, as it involves protonation at a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z 69.066). This indicates a direct relationship where ionization is essential for the measurement and analysis of isoprene concentrations in the exhaust gas from the photosynthesis system."
