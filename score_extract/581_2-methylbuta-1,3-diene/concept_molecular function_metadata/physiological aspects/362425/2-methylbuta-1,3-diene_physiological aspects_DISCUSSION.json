    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is a precursor to isoprene, is indirectly related to physiological aspects of Grey poplar trees. The study examines the physiological performance of transgenic poplar genotypes with and without isoprene emissions under environmental stress. The findings suggest that the absence of isoprene emission has a marginal influence on the physiological performance of the plants, indicating that isoprene may play a role in stress mitigation, but its absence does not significantly alter growth or biomass yield under the tested conditions."
