    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile isoprenoid, is discussed in relation to its antioxidant properties and potential roles in plant stress responses. While it is suggested that isoprenoids like isoprene may participate in signaling pathways, the specific connection to signal transduction is not explicitly detailed. The mention of isoprene's role in secondary signaling with reactive species hints at a relationship, but lacks direct evidence or detailed exploration of signal transduction mechanisms involving 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene."
