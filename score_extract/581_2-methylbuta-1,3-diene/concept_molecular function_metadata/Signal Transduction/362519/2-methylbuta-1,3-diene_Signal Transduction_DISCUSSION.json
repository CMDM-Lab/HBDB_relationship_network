    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is implicated in signal transduction pathways related to plant responses to abiotic stresses. It is suggested that isoprene interacts with nitric oxide (NO) to modulate oxidative damage and activate signaling cascades, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which are crucial for the hypersensitive response in plants. This indicates a significant role for isoprene in cellular signaling mechanisms beyond its antioxidant properties."
