    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its oxidation under oxidative stress conditions in plants. The text suggests that isoprene can be oxidized to products like MVK and MACR, indicating a direct relationship between isoprene and oxidation processes. However, the study did not detect these oxidation products at the plant or leaf level, suggesting that while oxidation is a relevant process, its detection and quantification in this context may be limited."
