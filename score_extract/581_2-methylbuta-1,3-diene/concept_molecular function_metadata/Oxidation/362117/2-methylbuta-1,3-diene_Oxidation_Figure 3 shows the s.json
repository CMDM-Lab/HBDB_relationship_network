    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes, particularly in the formation of formaldehyde (HCHO) during atmospheric reactions. The oxidation of isoprene is significant even under low NOx conditions, indicating its role in atmospheric chemistry and the production of secondary pollutants. This highlights the importance of isoprene oxidation in understanding air quality and chemical processes in remote ecosystems."
