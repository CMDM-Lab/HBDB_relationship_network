    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied as a biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) that undergoes oxidation processes in the atmosphere. The oxidation of VOCs, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, contributes to the production of formaldehyde (HCHO), a significant oxidation product. The relationship highlights the role of oxidation in determining the atmospheric abundance of HCHO, which is influenced by the oxidation of various VOCs, including those emitted from tropical ecosystems."
