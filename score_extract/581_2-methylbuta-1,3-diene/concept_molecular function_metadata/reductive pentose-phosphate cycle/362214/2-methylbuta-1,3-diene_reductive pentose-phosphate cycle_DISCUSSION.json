    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is produced in plants through the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, which is linked to the reductive pentose-phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle). The synthesis of isoprene is influenced by the availability of carbon, as indicated by the relationship between photosynthesis and isoprene emission. When photosynthesis is limited, the production of isoprene is also affected, suggesting a connection between these metabolic processes."
