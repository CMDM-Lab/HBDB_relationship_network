    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis and emission in plants, which can be inhibited by environmental factors such as elevated CO2 levels. The text indicates that while isoprene production is influenced by various conditions, the specific role of inhibitors in this process is not elaborated upon, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed interaction."
