    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound also known as isoprene, is indirectly related to inhibitors through the discussion of elevated CO2 effects on isoprene emissions. The study examines how elevated CO2 concentrations influence isoprene release from different genotypes, but does not provide specific details on inhibitors that affect this process. Thus, while there is a mention of isoprene emissions, the relationship with inhibitors is not explicitly defined or explored."
