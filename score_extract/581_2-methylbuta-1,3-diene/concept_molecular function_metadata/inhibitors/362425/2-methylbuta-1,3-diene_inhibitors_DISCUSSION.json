    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in plants under varying CO2 conditions. The mention of inhibitors refers to the inhibitory effect of elevated CO2 on the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway, which is crucial for isoprene production. This suggests a significant relationship where elevated CO2 acts as an inhibitor of isoprene biosynthesis, impacting the metabolic processes in isoprene-emitting (IE) plants compared to non-emitting (NE) plants."
