    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission rates from trees under varying light conditions. The study emphasizes the importance of light effects on isoprene emissions, indicating that leaf cuvettes can be modified to measure these emissions effectively. The relationship highlights how light influences the production of isoprene, a volatile organic compound, during photosynthesis, suggesting a direct connection between light exposure and isoprene emission rates."
