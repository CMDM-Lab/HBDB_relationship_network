    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its effects on electron transport rate (ETR) in plants under abiotic stress. While the context mentions isoprene's interaction with reactive oxygen species, it does not provide any direct information about drug interactions or how 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may influence pharmacological effects. The relationship between isoprene and drug interactions remains unclear and is not elaborated upon in the provided text."
