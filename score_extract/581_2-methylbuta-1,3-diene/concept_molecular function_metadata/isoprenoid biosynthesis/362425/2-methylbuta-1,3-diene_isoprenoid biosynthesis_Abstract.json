    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a key intermediate in isoprene biosynthesis, is discussed in relation to the biochemical and environmental factors influencing isoprene production in plants. The synthesis of isoprene is highlighted as a significant metabolic process that is affected by light, temperature, and CO2 levels, indicating a direct relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprenoid biosynthesis, particularly under varying environmental conditions."
