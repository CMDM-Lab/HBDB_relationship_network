    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound, is linked to isoprenoid biosynthesis, particularly in the context of transgenic IE tobacco plants. The study discusses how drought stress affects the growth of these plants and their carbon gain, which is related to the metabolic pathway of isoprene production. Elevated CO2 conditions influence the flux through the methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway, which is crucial for isoprenoid biosynthesis, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and the biosynthetic pathway."
