    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile compound, is linked to isoprenoid biosynthesis in apple fruitlets. The study indicates that isoprene biosynthesis persists even under conditions that inhibit photosynthesis, suggesting that metabolic pathways, including starch degradation and respiration, contribute to the production of isoprene. This highlights the role of isoprenoid biosynthesis in response to nutritional stress in fruit development."
