    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor to isoprene biosynthesis, is discussed in relation to the metabolic processes in apple fruitlets under nutritional stress. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears unrelated to the biochemical processes described, as it typically refers to a legal or formal decision-making process, not a biological or chemical interaction. Therefore, there is no meaningful connection between the two terms in this context."
