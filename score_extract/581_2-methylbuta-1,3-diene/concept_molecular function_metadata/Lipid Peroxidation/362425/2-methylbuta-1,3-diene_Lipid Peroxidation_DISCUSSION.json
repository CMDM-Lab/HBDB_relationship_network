    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its potential protective effects against oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation in plants under abiotic stress. The interaction of isoprene with reactive oxygen species may help stabilize thylakoid membranes, thereby reducing lipid peroxidation, which is a key indicator of oxidative stress in plant cells. This suggests a significant role of isoprene in mitigating oxidative damage, linking it directly to lipid peroxidation processes."
