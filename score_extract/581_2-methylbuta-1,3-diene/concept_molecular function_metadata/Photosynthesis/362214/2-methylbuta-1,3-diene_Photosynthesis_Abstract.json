    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is synthesized in chloroplasts from carbon compounds that are primarily fixed through photosynthesis. The production of isoprene is linked to the metabolic pathways that utilize carbon from photosynthesis, indicating a direct relationship where photosynthesis provides the necessary substrates for isoprene synthesis. This connection highlights the role of photosynthesis not only in energy production but also in the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds like isoprene, which may protect leaves from environmental stressors."
