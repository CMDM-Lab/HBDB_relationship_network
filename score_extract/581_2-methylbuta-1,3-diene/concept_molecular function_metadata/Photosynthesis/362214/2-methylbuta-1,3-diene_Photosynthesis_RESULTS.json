    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to photosynthesis. The study indicates that the addition of DOX-d2 did not significantly affect the rate of photosynthesis, suggesting that the emission of isoprene from the leaf was largely independent of photosynthetic activity. This implies a minimal direct relationship between isoprene emission and the photosynthetic process under the experimental conditions described."
