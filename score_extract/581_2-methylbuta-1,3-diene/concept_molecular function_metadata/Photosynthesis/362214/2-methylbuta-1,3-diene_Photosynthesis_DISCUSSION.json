    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves during heat stress, which can occur even when photosynthesis is negatively impacted. The regulation of isoprene emission appears to depend more on substrate availability than on photosynthetic activity, indicating a complex relationship where isoprene production can persist despite reduced photosynthetic function."
