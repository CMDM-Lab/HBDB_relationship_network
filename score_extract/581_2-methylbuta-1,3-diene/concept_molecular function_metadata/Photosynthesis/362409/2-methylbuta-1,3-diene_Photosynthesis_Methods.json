    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission rates from oak leaves during varying drought conditions. The study examines how these emissions correlate with photosynthesis, as isoprene is a byproduct of photosynthetic processes in plants. The relationship is significant as it highlights the physiological responses of oak species to environmental stressors, linking isoprene emissions to the broader context of photosynthesis and plant health."
