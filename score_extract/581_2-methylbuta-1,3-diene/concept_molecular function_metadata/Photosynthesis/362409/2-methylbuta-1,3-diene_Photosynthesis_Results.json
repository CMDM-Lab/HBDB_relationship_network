    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions during photosynthesis, particularly under stress conditions like drought and high temperatures. The study suggests that isoprene production may not solely rely on photosynthetic products, indicating a complex relationship where isoprene emissions can occur even when photosynthesis is expected to be low, hinting at alternative metabolic pathways involved in isoprene synthesis."
