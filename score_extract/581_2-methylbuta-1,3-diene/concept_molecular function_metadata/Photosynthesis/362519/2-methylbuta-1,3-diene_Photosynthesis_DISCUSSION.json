    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is primarily synthesized from carbon derived from photosynthesis in various plant species. The text indicates that while photosynthesis is a major source of carbon for isoprene biosynthesis, other metabolic processes, such as starch degradation and mitochondrial respiration, may also contribute. This highlights the interconnectedness of photosynthesis and isoprene production, particularly under conditions of nutritional stress in apple fruitlets."
