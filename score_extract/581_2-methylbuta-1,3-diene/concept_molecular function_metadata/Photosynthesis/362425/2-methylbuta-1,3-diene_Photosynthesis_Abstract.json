    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, is indirectly related to photosynthesis as the study investigates the photosynthetic performance of poplar trees under varying climate conditions. The research aims to understand how changes in climate affect both photosynthesis and isoprene emissions, highlighting the role of photosynthesis in the overall fitness and growth of poplar trees. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and photosynthesis is not explicitly detailed."
