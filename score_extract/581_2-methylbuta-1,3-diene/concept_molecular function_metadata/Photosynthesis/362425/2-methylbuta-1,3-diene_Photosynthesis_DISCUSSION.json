    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission by plants during stress conditions such as drought and heat. The study highlights how isoprene emissions may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of photosynthetic processes, particularly in non-isoprene emitting (NE) plants. This suggests a significant role of isoprene in maintaining photosynthesis under adverse conditions, indicating a direct relationship between isoprene emissions and the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants facing environmental stress."
