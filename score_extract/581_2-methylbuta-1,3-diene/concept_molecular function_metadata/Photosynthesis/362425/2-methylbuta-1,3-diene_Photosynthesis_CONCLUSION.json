    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from poplar plants during photosynthesis. The study indicates that while isoprene fluxes increased under certain stress conditions, it does not enhance the plants' ability to mitigate stress or improve photosynthesis rates significantly. The relationship suggests that isoprene emission is a response to stress rather than a direct enhancer of photosynthetic efficiency."
