    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to transcriptional activation through its role in isoprene biosynthesis and the regulation of gene expression associated with this pathway. The up-regulation of specific DXS genes, which are involved in the biosynthesis of isoprene and ABA, suggests that transcriptional activation is necessary to enhance the production of these compounds. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the metabolic pathway than on direct transcriptional mechanisms."
