    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in plants, which is influenced by environmental factors. However, there is no mention or connection to signal peptide peptidase activity, which is an enzymatic function unrelated to isoprene biosynthesis. The two terms appear in the same context but do not interact or relate to each other in any meaningful way."
