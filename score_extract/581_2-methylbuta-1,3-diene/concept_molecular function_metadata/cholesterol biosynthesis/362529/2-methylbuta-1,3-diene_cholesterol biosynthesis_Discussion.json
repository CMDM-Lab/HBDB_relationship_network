    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is produced from mevalonate, a key intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis. The study highlights a direct relationship where the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, a critical enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, leads to reduced levels of isoprene in breath. Additionally, elevated breath isoprene levels in chronic kidney disease (CKD) animals correlate with increased serum cholesterol, indicating that isoprene production is linked to cholesterol metabolism and may serve as a biomarker for cholesterol synthesis activity."
