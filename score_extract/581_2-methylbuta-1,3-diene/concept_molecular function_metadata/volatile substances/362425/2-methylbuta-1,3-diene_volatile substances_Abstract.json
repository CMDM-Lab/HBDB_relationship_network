    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is identified as a significant biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, particularly in forest ecosystems. The emission of isoprene contributes to the overall exchange of carbon and energy in plants and plays a crucial role in influencing atmospheric chemistry and climate. The relationship between isoprene and volatile substances is highlighted through its impact on air quality and ecosystem processes, indicating that isoprene is a key example of a volatile substance with substantial ecological significance."
