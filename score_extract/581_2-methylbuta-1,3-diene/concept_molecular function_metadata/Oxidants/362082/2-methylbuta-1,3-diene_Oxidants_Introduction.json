    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a type of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), is implicated in atmospheric chemistry as it can photochemically react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to enhance the production of ozone, a significant oxidant. The text highlights the role of BVOCs, including isoprene, in generating oxidants and suggests that increased emissions due to global warming could lead to higher concentrations of photochemical oxidants, emphasizing the importance of monitoring these emissions for environmental assessments."
