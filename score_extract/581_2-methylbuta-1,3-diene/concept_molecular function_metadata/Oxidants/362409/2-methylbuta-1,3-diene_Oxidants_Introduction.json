    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), is indirectly related to oxidants through its role in atmospheric chemistry. BVOCs like 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene can influence oxidant levels and secondary aerosol formation, which are critical for understanding air quality and atmospheric processes. However, the specific interactions between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and oxidants are not detailed in the provided context."
