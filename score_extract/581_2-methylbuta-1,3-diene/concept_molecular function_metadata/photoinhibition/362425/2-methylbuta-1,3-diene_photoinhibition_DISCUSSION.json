    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is indirectly related to photoinhibition through its role in enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance of photosynthetic processes. The text discusses how non-isoprene-emitting (NE) plants experience photoinhibition due to structural and functional changes in their thylakoid membranes, which may be mitigated in isoprene-emitting plants. However, the specific interaction between isoprene and photoinhibition is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more general relationship rather than a direct one."
