    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a volatile organic compound related to isoprene emissions, is linked to secondary metabolism through its role in the transcriptional regulation mechanisms associated with isoprene production and abscission in fruitlets. The study highlights the activation of specific metabolic pathways, including terpenoids, which are derived from secondary metabolism, indicating a significant relationship between the compound and metabolic processes in the plant."
