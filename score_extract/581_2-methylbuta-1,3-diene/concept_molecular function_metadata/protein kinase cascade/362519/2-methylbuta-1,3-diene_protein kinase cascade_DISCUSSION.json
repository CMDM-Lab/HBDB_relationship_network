    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is implicated in signaling pathways that may influence cellular responses to abiotic stresses, including the activation of protein kinase cascades. Isoprene's interaction with nitric oxide (NO) suggests a role in signaling mechanisms that trigger the hypersensitive response in plants, potentially involving mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. This indicates a significant relationship where isoprene may modulate signaling pathways critical for plant stress responses."
