    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a reactive biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC), is indirectly related to leaf development through its emissions, which are influenced by factors such as leaf development stage, light environment, and temperature history. The studies referenced focus on measuring isoprene emissions, which are relevant to the broader category of BVOCs, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, in relation to leaf characteristics. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and leaf development is not explicitly detailed."
