    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned alongside various atmospheric measurements, including pressure, as part of a broader study on chemical constituents and their interactions in the atmosphere. However, there is no direct discussion of how 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene specifically relates to pressure as a physical agent, making their connection largely incidental within the context of the study."
