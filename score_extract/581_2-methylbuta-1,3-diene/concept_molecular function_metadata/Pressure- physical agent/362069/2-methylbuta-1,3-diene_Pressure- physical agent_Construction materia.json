    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its vapor pressure and the effects of physical agents like pressure on its behavior in the gas phase. The relationship is highlighted through the mention of how vapor pressure influences analyte adsorption losses, which are critical for understanding the behavior of volatile organic compounds in experimental setups. However, the specific interaction between isoprene and pressure as a physical agent is not deeply explored beyond its general influence on vapor pressure."
