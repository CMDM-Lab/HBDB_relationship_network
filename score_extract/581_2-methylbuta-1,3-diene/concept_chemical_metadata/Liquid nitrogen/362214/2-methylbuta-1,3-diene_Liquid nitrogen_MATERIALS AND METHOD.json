    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is studied in relation to its emission rates from leaves, which are subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen for preservation before further analysis. Liquid nitrogen is used to quickly freeze the leaf samples, ensuring that the biochemical properties of isoprene are maintained for accurate DMAPP assays. However, there is no direct chemical interaction or functional relationship discussed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and liquid nitrogen beyond this preservation method."
