    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and acetylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the atmosphere, particularly in relation to photochemical processes. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their classification as VOCs. The focus is more on their concentrations and measurements rather than any functional or chemical relationship."
