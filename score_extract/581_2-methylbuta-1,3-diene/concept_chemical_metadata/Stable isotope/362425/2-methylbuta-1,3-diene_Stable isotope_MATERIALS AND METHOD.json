    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is analyzed alongside stable isotopes, specifically the stable 13C isotope, to quantify isoprene oxidation products. The presence of the stable isotope allows for the differentiation of isoprene from its oxidation products during gas-exchange measurements, indicating a methodological relationship where stable isotopes are used to enhance the accuracy of isoprene quantification in the study."
