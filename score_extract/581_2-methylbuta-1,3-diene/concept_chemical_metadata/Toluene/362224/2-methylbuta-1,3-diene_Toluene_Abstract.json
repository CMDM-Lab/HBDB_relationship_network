    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured during atmospheric studies. However, there is no direct discussion of their interactions or specific relationships. They are included in a broader analysis of atmospheric constituents, indicating they share a common category but lack detailed connection in the study."
