    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and n-hexanal are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the exhaled breath of rats, including those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the study does not provide specific details on their relationship or interactions, focusing instead on the overall presence of various VOCs in breath and fecal emissions. The lack of direct comparison or functional relationship between these two compounds limits the depth of their connection."
