    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and methane are both mentioned as components influencing ozone formation processes in the atmosphere. However, their relationship is not directly discussed; rather, they are referenced in the context of ambient volatile organic compound (VOC) reactivity and its impact on hydroxyl radical loss rates. The focus is more on their collective influence on ozone production rather than a specific interaction between the two compounds."
