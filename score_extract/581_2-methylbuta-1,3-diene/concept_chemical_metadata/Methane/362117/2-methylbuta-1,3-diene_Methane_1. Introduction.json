    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and methane are both mentioned as components of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the terrestrial biosphere. However, the context primarily focuses on the emissions of isoprene as the dominant non-methane VOC and does not provide specific details on the relationship or interactions between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and methane. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than a direct connection."
