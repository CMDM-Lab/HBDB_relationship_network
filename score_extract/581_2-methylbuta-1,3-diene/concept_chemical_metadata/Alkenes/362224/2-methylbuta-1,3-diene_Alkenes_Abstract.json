    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is identified as a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that contributes to the overall reactivity of alkenes in atmospheric chemistry. Alkenes, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, are involved in reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and ozone (O3), which are significant for understanding ozone formation and secondary organic aerosol production. The mention of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene within the broader category of alkenes highlights its role in atmospheric reactions, although the specific interactions are not deeply explored."
