    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (also known as isoprene) is indirectly related to ozone through its role as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to ozone formation in the atmosphere. The text discusses the sensitivity of ozone concentrations to NOx levels and the impact of land-use changes, such as converting rainforest to oil palm plantations, which increases VOC emissions, including isoprene. This suggests that higher emissions of isoprene can lead to increased ozone levels, which have detrimental effects on health and the environment."
