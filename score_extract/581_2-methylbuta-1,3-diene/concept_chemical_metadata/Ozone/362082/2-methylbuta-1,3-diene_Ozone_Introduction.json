    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its protective role against ozone exposure in plants. Isoprene emissions are suggested to directly quench ozone, thereby mitigating potential damage from this reactive gas. This highlights a significant interaction where isoprene serves as a defense mechanism for plants against oxidative stress caused by ozone."
