    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions and their impact on surface ozone levels. The study simulates isoprene emissions and ozone levels for different time periods, indicating that changes in vegetation and isoprene emissions can influence future ozone concentrations. However, the specific chemical interactions between isoprene and ozone are not detailed, focusing instead on broader environmental impacts."
