    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emitted from plants, is indirectly related to ozone through its role in affecting local air quality. The degradation of forests in Amazonia may influence isoprene emissions, which in turn can impact ozone concentrations. While the relationship is acknowledged, it lacks detailed exploration of the specific interactions between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and ozone."
