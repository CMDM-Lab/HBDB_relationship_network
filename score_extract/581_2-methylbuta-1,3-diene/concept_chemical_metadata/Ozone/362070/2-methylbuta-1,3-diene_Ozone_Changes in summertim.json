    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions and their impact on surface ozone levels. The text indicates that isoprene emissions significantly influence projected future ozone concentrations, suggesting a direct relationship where increased isoprene leads to higher ozone levels. This interaction highlights the role of vegetation in modulating air quality and ozone dynamics."
