    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is a biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to the formation of ozone in the atmosphere through its oxidation processes. The oxidation of VOCs, including isoprene, leads to the production of formaldehyde (HCHO), which is linked to ozone formation. The relationship is significant as the atmospheric chemistry involving VOCs and ozone is crucial for understanding air quality and ecological impacts in tropical ecosystems."
