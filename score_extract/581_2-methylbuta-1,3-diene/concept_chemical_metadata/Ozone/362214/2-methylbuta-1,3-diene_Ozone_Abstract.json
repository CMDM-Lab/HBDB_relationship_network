    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from plants and its protective role against ozone and other reactive oxygen species. Isoprene is hypothesized to help plants mitigate heat damage and oxidative stress caused by ozone exposure, indicating a significant interaction between the two compounds in the context of plant physiology and environmental stress responses."
