    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (also known as isoprene) is identified as a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that plays a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the formation of ozone. The text discusses how regional models can simulate ozone formation based on emissions of NOx and biogenic isoprene, indicating a direct relationship where isoprene contributes to ozone production in the atmosphere. This highlights the importance of understanding the reactivity of VOCs like isoprene in relation to ozone formation."
