    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is identified as a biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) that contributes to the production of tropospheric ozone. The emissions of isoprene and other terpenes from forest ecosystems play a significant role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the formation of ozone and aerosols. The relationship is highlighted through the discussion of how BVOCs influence ozone levels in the troposphere, especially under varying temperature conditions."
