    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not directly mentioned, but aldehydes such as pentanal, hexanal, and heptanal are discussed in relation to their levels in the exhaled breath of control and chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats. The study highlights significant differences in the abundance of these aldehydes between the two groups, suggesting a potential metabolic alteration in CKD. However, the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and aldehydes is not explicitly established, indicating a lack of direct interaction or relevance."
