    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to aldehydes through its role as a precursor in atmospheric chemistry. The oxidation of isoprene, which includes 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, leads to the formation of various products, including aldehydes like formaldehyde (HCHO). The context discusses the atmospheric processes and emissions related to isoprene, highlighting the production of aldehydes as a significant outcome of its oxidation, although the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and aldehydes is not deeply explored."
