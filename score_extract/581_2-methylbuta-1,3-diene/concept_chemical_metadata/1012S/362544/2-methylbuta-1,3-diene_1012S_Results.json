    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to its emission rates over rainforest and oil palm plantations, with specific mixing ratios provided in parts per trillion (pptv). The term '1012S' appears to refer to a measurement unit (parts per trillion), indicating the concentration of isoprene in the atmosphere. However, there is no direct discussion of a relationship between isoprene and the specific measurement unit beyond this context."
