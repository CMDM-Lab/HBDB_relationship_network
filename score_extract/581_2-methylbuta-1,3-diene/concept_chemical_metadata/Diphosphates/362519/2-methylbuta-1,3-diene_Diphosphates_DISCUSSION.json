    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is linked to diphosphates through its biosynthesis pathway, specifically the involvement of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (a diphosphate) as a substrate for isoprene synthase. The availability of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, synthesized via the MEP pathway, is crucial for isoprene production, indicating a biochemical relationship where diphosphates play a role in the metabolic processes leading to isoprene emission in plants."
