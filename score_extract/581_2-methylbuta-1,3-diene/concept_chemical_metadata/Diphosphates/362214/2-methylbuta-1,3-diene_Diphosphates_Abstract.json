    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is synthesized from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) in chloroplasts by the enzyme isoprene synthase. Diphosphates, such as DMAPP, are crucial substrates in the biosynthetic pathway for isoprene production. This indicates a direct biochemical relationship where diphosphates serve as precursors for the formation of isoprene, linking them in the metabolic context of plant physiology."
