    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to enzyme kinetics, particularly isoprene synthase, which utilizes diphosphate substrates like geranyl diphosphate. The Km values for these substrates indicate their affinity for the enzyme, suggesting a biochemical relationship where diphosphates are crucial for the synthesis of isoprene. However, the specific interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and diphosphates is not elaborated upon in detail."
