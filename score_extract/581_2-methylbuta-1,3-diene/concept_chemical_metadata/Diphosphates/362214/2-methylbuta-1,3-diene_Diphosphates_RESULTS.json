    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to diphosphates through the metabolic pathway involving DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate), a C5-diphosphate. The study discusses the conversion of DOX-d2 to DMAPP-d2 in chloroplasts, indicating that diphosphates are precursors in the biosynthesis of isoprene. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, focusing more on the metabolic processes rather than a direct interaction between the two terms."
