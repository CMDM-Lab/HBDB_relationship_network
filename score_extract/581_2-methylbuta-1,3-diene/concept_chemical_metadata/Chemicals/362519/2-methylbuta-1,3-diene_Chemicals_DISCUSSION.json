    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its biosynthesis in apple fruitlets under nutritional stress. While the term 'Chemicals' is broadly mentioned, it does not provide specific details or interactions regarding 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. The focus is primarily on metabolic pathways and the sources of carbon for isoprene biosynthesis, rather than a direct relationship with other chemicals."
