    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves, which is influenced by carbon availability. The study indicates that the rate of isoprene emission increases when leaves are carbon-starved, suggesting a direct relationship between carbon levels and isoprene production through the MEP pathway. However, the specific biochemical mechanisms linking 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon are not elaborated in detail."
