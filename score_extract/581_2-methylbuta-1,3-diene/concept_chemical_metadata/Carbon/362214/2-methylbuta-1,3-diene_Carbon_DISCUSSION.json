    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emission from leaves, which is influenced by the availability of carbon sources, particularly through the MEP pathway. The regulation of isoprene emission is linked to the concentration of DMAPP, a carbon-containing intermediate, suggesting that carbon availability directly impacts isoprene production. However, the relationship is more about the role of carbon in the metabolic pathway rather than a direct interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and carbon itself."
