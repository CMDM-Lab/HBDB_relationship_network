    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emission from Quercus rubra leaves under drought conditions. The text suggests that isoprene may be produced from a source other than recently fixed carbon, indicating a potential metabolic pathway that does not rely solely on carbon fixation. This implies a relationship between isoprene production and carbon, as isoprene is a carbon-based compound, but the specific dynamics of their interaction are not deeply explored."
