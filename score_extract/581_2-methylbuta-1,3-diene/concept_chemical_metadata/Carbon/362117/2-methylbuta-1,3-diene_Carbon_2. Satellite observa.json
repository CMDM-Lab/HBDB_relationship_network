    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its emissions and atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the context of carbon compounds. Isoprene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to atmospheric carbon dynamics through its oxidation processes, leading to the formation of carbon-containing products like formaldehyde (HCHO) and acetone. However, the relationship is primarily indirect, as carbon is a broader category encompassing various compounds, including isoprene, without a specific focus on their direct interactions."
