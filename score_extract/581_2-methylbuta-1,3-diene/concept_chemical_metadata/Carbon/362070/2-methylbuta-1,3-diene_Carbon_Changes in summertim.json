    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is indirectly related to carbon through its emissions and their impact on carbon uptake by vegetation. The reduction in isoprene emissions due to decreased ozone concentrations could enhance carbon uptake, thereby influencing atmospheric CO2 levels. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the broader implications of forest degradation on carbon dynamics and climate feedback mechanisms."
