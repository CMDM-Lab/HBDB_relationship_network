    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emissions from poplar trees and their impact on carbon gain during drought stress conditions. The study evaluates how isoprene emissions influence photosynthetic performance and overall carbon assimilation in plants, indicating a direct relationship between isoprene emissions and carbon dynamics in the context of climate change. However, the specific chemical structure of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not elaborated upon in relation to carbon itself, but rather its role in carbon gain is emphasized."
