    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and pentanal are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the exhaled breath of animals, including those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction, as the focus is on the differences in VOCs between CKD and control animals. The presence of these compounds is noted, but their specific roles or connections are not elaborated upon."
