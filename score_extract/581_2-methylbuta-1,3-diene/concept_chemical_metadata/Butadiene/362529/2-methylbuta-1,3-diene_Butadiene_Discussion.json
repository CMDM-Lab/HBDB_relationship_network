    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed as a byproduct of cholesterol biosynthesis, with its production linked to the activity of HMG-CoA reductase. While butadiene is not directly mentioned in relation to cholesterol metabolism, it is chemically related to isoprene as a diene compound. The context suggests a biochemical pathway involving isoprene production, but does not elaborate on a direct relationship with butadiene beyond their structural similarities."
