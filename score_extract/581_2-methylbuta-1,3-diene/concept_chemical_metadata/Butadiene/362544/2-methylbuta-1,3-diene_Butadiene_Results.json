    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned as a significant volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from oil palm plantations, with emissions being five times greater than those from rainforest areas. Butadiene, while not directly discussed, is a related compound in the context of VOCs. The relationship between isoprene and butadiene is implied through their classification as VOCs, but no direct interaction or comparison is provided in the study."
