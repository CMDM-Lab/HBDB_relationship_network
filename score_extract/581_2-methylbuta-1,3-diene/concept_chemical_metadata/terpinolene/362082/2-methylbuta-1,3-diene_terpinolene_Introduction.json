    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and terpinolene are both identified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by various plant species in the Kinki region of Japan. However, the text does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative significance between these two compounds, merely listing them among other BVOCs measured from dominant plant species. Their relationship is limited to their classification as BVOCs without further detail on their ecological or chemical interactions."
