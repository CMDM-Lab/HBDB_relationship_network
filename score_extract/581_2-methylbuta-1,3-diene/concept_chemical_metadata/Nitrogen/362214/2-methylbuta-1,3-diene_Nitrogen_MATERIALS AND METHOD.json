    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is indirectly related to nitrogen through the experimental method involving nitrogen flushing during the preparation of samples. Nitrogen is used to create an inert atmosphere in the assay vial filled with sulfuric acid, which is essential for the accurate measurement of isoprene concentration. However, there is no direct chemical or biological interaction discussed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and nitrogen."
