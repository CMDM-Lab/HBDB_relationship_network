    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and nitrogen are indirectly related through their roles in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in ozone formation processes. The text discusses how ambient concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) influence ozone production rates, which can be affected by the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and nitrogen."
