    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and aluminum are mentioned in a study involving leaf tissue analysis and photoacoustic measurements. However, there is no direct interaction or relationship discussed between isoprene and aluminum. The mention of aluminum appears incidental, as it is used to cover samples during storage, without any implication of a chemical or biological interaction with isoprene."
