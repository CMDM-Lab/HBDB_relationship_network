    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to its oxidation under oxidative stress, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with protons. Protons are referenced in the context of measurement techniques (PTR-QMS and PTR-ToF-MS) used to analyze isoprene emissions and oxidation products. The connection between isoprene and protons is indirect, as protons are part of the analytical methods rather than a chemical interaction or physiological relationship."
