    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is detected and monitored using a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). Protons play a crucial role in the ionization process of isoprene, as the mass spectrometer detects the protonated form of isoprene at a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z 69.066). This indicates a direct relationship where protons are essential for the analytical detection of isoprene concentrations in the exhaust gas."
