    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to isotopes through the mention of isoprene emissions, specifically the detection of the double isotope 13C of isoprene. While 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene, the context primarily focuses on the isotopic analysis of isoprene rather than a direct relationship with 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene itself. Thus, the connection is weak and primarily based on their shared category as volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
