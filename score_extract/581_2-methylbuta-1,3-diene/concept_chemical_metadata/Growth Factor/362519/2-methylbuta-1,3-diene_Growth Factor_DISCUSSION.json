    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its role in signaling pathways that may influence cellular responses to abiotic stresses. While it is noted that isoprene can cooperate with nitric oxide (NO) in reducing oxidative damage and may affect various signaling cascades, the term 'Growth Factor' is not explicitly defined or directly linked to isoprene's actions. The relationship appears to be more about signaling interactions rather than a direct connection to growth factors."
