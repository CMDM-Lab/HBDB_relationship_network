    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is identified as a significant isoprenoid compound involved in abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The isoprenoid pathway's activation leads to increased isoprene emissions during stress conditions, indicating that isoprene serves as a marker for physiological responses in fruitlets under stress. This highlights the critical role of isoprenoids in plant stress responses."
