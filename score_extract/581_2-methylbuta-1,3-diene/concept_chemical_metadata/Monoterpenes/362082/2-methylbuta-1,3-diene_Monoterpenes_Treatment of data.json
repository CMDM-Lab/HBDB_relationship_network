    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to monoterpenes, as both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants. The emission rates of isoprene are influenced by temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), while monoterpene emissions from coniferous plants are reported to increase exponentially with temperature. This indicates a shared biological process in plant emissions, although the specific mechanisms and conditions for each compound's emission differ."
