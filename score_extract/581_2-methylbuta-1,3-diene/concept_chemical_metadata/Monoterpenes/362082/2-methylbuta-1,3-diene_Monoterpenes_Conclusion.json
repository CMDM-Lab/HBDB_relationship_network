    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to monoterpenes as both are classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The study focuses on the emission patterns of various monoterpenes in response to light intensity, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, although not specifically mentioned in the emission data, is part of the broader category of BVOCs that may also be influenced by similar environmental factors. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or roles."
