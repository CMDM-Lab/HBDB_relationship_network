    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned as a significant biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) alongside monoterpenes, which are also abundant BVOCs emitted from plants. Both compounds play crucial roles in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in their reactions with nitrogen oxides (NOx) that contribute to ozone production in the troposphere. While they are both classified as BVOCs, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their shared classification."
