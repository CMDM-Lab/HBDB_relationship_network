    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and monoterpenes are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by vegetation. The text discusses their emission patterns, noting that isoprene emissions peak during the day due to light intensity, while monoterpenes are emitted consistently at night, influenced by temperature. Although both are BVOCs, their emission dynamics differ significantly based on environmental conditions."
