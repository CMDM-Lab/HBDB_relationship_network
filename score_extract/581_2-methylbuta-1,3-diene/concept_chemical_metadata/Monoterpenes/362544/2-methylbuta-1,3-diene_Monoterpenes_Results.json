    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) related to monoterpenes, which are a class of VOCs emitted from plants. The discussion focuses on the emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes in relation to NOx concentrations and their environmental impacts, indicating that both compounds are part of the broader category of biogenic VOCs affecting air quality and climate. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes is not elaborated upon in detail."
