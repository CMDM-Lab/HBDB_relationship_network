    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned alongside monoterpenes as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from oak trees. The study investigates the emission rates of these compounds in response to drought stress among different oak species. While both terms are related as types of VOCs produced by plants, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes is not deeply explored beyond their co-occurrence in the study of emissions."
