    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to monoterpenes (MNTs) as both are involved in the study of volatile organic compounds emitted from plants. The discussion focuses on the mixing ratios and reactions of various compounds, including Î²-ocimene, which is a type of monoterpene. While 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not explicitly detailed, its classification as a volatile compound suggests a broader connection to the behavior and emissions of monoterpenes in the environment, particularly under varying conditions such as drought and temperature changes."
