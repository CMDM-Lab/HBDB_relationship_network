    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that is analyzed alongside monoterpenes (MNT) in the study of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions. The focus is on the ratios of isoprene to monoterpenes and the relative abundance of individual monoterpene compounds, indicating that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is part of the broader category of monoterpenes but does not have a detailed interaction or specific relationship highlighted in the analysis."
