    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is mentioned alongside monoterpenes as part of a discussion on biogenic emissions and their contributions to hydroxyl (OH) reactivity. While both are types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can influence atmospheric chemistry, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpenes, indicating that they are considered separately in terms of their contributions to OH reactivity."
