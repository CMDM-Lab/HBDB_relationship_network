    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is mentioned as a significant emission from Eucalyptus leaves. Monoterpenes are a broader class of compounds that includes isoprene. While the study focuses on isoprene emissions, it implies a relationship with monoterpenes as part of the overall volatile organic compound emissions from the plant, although specific interactions or comparisons are not detailed."
