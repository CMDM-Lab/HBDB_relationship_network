    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and beta-pinene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in relation to isoprene emissions and their oxidation products. While beta-pinene is specifically noted for its atmospheric reactions, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not directly linked to beta-pinene's behavior or products in the provided context, indicating a general association rather than a detailed interaction."
