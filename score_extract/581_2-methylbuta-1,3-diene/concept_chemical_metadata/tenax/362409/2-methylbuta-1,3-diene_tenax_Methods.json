    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is measured as part of leaf emission rates, while Tenax is used as an adsorbent cartridge for sampling the exit air from the leaf cuvette. The relationship is that Tenax facilitates the collection and analysis of isoprene emissions, allowing for quantification and identification through gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, the context does not delve into the specific interactions or chemical properties of isoprene and Tenax beyond their roles in the sampling process."
