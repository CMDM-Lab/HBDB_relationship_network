    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is identified as a member of the hemiterpenes, which are a subclass of isoprenoids. The text discusses the role of volatile isoprenoids, including hemiterpenes like isoprene, in plant defense mechanisms against oxidative stress and other abiotic factors. This highlights the functional significance of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene within the broader category of hemiterpenes, emphasizing its antioxidant properties and involvement in plant physiological responses."
