    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is discussed in relation to its role in signaling pathways that may involve jasmonate during plant responses to abiotic stresses. Isoprene is suggested to cooperate with nitric oxide (NO) in initiating signaling cascades that lead to the elicitation of jasmonate and salicylate pathways, which are crucial for the hypersensitive response in plants. This indicates a potential interaction where isoprene may influence jasmonate signaling, although the specifics of this relationship are not deeply elaborated."
