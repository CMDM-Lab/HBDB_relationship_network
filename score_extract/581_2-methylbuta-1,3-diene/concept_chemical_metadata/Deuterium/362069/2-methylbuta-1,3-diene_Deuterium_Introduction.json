    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and deuterium are related through isotopic labeling experiments aimed at characterizing isoprene production and emissions. Deuterium, as a stable isotope, is used to trace and analyze the dynamics of isoprene fluxes in various environmental conditions. This relationship highlights the methodological approach to studying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene, but does not delve into direct interactions between the two substances."
