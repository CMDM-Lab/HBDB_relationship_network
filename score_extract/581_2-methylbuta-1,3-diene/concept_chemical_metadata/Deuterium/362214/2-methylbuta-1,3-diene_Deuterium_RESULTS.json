    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is studied in relation to deuterium-labeled compounds (DOX-d2) during photosynthesis experiments. The administration of DOX-d2 resulted in a significant proportion of emitted isoprene being labeled with deuterium, indicating a direct relationship where deuterium is used to trace the metabolic pathway of isoprene emission in the leaf. This suggests that deuterium labeling is effective in studying the dynamics of isoprene production during photosynthesis."
