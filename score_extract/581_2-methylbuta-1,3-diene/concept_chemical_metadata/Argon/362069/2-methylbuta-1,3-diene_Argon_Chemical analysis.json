    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and argon are mentioned in relation to analytical methods for measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Argon ionization detectors are one of the techniques used for detecting isoprene emissions. However, the relationship is limited to the mention of argon as a detection method without any detailed discussion of their chemical interactions or biological significance."
