    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, a precursor to isoprene biosynthesis, is linked to carbohydrates through metabolic processes. The carbon for isoprene is primarily derived from photosynthesis, but carbohydrates, particularly from starch degradation and respiration, also contribute to its biosynthesis. The study suggests that during nutritional stress in apple fruitlets, the availability of carbohydrates influences isoprene production, indicating a metabolic interplay between carbohydrates and isoprene synthesis."
