    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as contributors to hydroxyl (OH) reactivity in the atmosphere. The data indicates that acetaldehyde contributes 12% to the overall OH reactivity, similar to formaldehyde (HCHO). While both compounds are part of the broader discussion on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their reactivity, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between them beyond their contributions to OH reactivity."
