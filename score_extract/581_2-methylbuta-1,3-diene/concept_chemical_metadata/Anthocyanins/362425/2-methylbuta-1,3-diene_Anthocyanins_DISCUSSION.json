    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) and anthocyanins are indirectly related through their roles in plant responses to oxidative stress and drought conditions. While isoprene emission is linked to plant growth and stress responses, the study notes a long-lasting impairment of leaf pigmentation, including anthocyanins, during drought stress. This suggests that isoprene may play a role in the physiological processes that affect anthocyanin levels, although a direct interaction is not explicitly detailed."
