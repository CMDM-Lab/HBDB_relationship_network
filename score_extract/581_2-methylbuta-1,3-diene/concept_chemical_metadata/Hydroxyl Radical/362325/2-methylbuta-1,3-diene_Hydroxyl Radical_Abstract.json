    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to its ambient concentrations affecting ozone formation processes. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) are critical in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene. The text indicates that lower isoprene concentrations lead to reduced reactivity and subsequently influence hydroxyl radical loss rates, suggesting a connection between isoprene levels and hydroxyl radical dynamics in the atmosphere."
