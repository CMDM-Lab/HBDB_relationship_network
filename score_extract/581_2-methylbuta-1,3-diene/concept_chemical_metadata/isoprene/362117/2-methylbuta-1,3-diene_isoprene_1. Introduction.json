    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from tropical ecosystems. The text discusses the importance of measuring these compounds for understanding their atmospheric impact, particularly in relation to the oxidation processes that produce formaldehyde (HCHO). While both compounds are mentioned in the context of VOC emissions, their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon."
