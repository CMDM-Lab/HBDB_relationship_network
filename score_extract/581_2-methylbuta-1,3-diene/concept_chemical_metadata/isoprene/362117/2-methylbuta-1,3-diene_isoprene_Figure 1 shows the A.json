    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to atmospheric studies. The context discusses the comparison of seasonal cycles of isoprene concentration with HCHO columns and fire counts, indicating that both compounds are part of the broader investigation into VOC emissions. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene."
