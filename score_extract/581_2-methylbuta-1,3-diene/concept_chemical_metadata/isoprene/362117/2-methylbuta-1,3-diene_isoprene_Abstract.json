    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from the terrestrial biosphere, particularly in relation to their concentrations during different seasons. The study highlights the significance of isoprene emissions in the context of biomass burning and drought conditions, suggesting a shared relevance in understanding the ecological and atmospheric impacts of these compounds. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not explicitly detailed beyond their classification as VOCs."
