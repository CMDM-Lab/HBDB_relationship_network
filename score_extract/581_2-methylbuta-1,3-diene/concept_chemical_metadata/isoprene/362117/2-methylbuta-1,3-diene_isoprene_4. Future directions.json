    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are directly related as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. The text discusses isoprene's role as a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted from plants, highlighting its significance in atmospheric chemistry and its contribution to formaldehyde (HCHO) production. The relationship is underscored by isoprene's prominence as a VOC, which is relevant to the study of emissions and environmental processes."
