    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned in relation to biogenic emissions, particularly in the study of seasonal variations in isoprene concentrations. While the context discusses isoprene emissions and their seasonal patterns, it does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, indicating that they are part of a broader discussion on volatile organic compounds emitted from vegetation."
