    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from plants. While the text discusses isoprene emissions and their impact on local air quality and climate, it does not provide specific details on the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene. Their connection lies in their shared classification as BVOCs, but the context lacks a direct interaction or comparative analysis between the two compounds."
