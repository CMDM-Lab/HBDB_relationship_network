    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by vegetation, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. The reduction in isoprene emissions due to forest degradation is mentioned as a factor that could influence carbon uptake and surface ozone concentrations, thereby affecting climate change feedback mechanisms. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not explicitly detailed beyond their shared classification as VOCs."
