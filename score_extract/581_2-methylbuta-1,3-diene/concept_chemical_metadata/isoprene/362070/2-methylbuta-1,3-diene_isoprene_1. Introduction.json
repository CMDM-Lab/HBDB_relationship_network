    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted into the atmosphere, particularly in relation to the effects of Amazon forest degradation on climate. While isoprene is a well-known biogenic VOC, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene, suggesting a close chemical relationship. However, the context does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative significance in the climate models discussed."
