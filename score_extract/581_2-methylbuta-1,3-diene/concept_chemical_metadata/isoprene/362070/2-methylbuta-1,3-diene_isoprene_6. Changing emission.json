    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from vegetation. The discussion focuses on isoprene emissions projected to increase significantly by 2100, with 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene being a structural isomer of isoprene. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparative analysis between the two compounds, limiting the depth of their relationship."
