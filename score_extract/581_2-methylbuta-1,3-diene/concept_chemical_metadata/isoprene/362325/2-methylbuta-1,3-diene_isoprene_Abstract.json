    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that contribute to atmospheric chemistry and ozone formation. Isoprene is highlighted as a significant biogenic VOC affecting ambient reactivity, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be related but not explicitly discussed in terms of its specific role or interaction with isoprene. Their relationship lies in their shared classification as BVOCs influencing air quality models."
