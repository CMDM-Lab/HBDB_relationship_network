    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contributing to the overall OH reactivity in the atmosphere. While isoprene is specifically noted to have a minor contribution (<6%) to the OH reactivity, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be related as a similar compound, but their direct relationship or interaction is not explicitly discussed. They are part of the broader category of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) relevant to atmospheric chemistry."
