    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both involved in the emission processes studied in the context of photosynthesis and the effects of deuterium-labeled compounds. The study indicates that the addition of DOX-d2 did not significantly alter the total rate of isoprene emission, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may serve as a precursor or related compound in isoprene production, although the specific interactions between them are not deeply explored."
