    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is directly related to isoprene as it is a structural isomer of isoprene. The study discusses the emission of isoprene from leaves and the biochemical pathways involved, particularly focusing on isoprene synthase and its substrate DMAPP. While the context emphasizes isoprene emission, the mention of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene suggests a close chemical relationship, as both compounds are part of the same metabolic pathway in plants, specifically in the synthesis of isoprene."
