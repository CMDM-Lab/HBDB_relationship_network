    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as isoprene is a product derived from the conversion of DMAPP (dimethylallyl diphosphate), which is a precursor in the biosynthetic pathway of terpenes. The mention of isoprene in relation to biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) indicates its significance in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in the context of forest emissions. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon in detail."
