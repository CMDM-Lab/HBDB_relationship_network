    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as isoprene is a volatile organic compound that is synthesized from the precursor 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. The study discusses the emission rates of isoprene in relation to chloroplastic DMAPP pools and isoprene synthase activity, indicating that variations in these factors influence isoprene production in plants. Thus, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene serves as a substrate for isoprene synthesis, highlighting a direct biochemical relationship."
