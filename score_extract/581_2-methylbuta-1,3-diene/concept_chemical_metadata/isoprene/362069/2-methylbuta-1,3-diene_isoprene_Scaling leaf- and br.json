    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as both are biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from vegetation. The study discusses isoprene fluxes and their measurement techniques, implying that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may share similar emission characteristics or ecological roles as isoprene, although the specific relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed."
