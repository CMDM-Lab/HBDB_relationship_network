    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with specific boiling points and saturation gas-phase concentrations. Isoprene, with a boiling point of 34Â°C, is highlighted in relation to other compounds like MT and SQT, but there is no direct discussion of their chemical relationship or interactions. The focus is on their physical properties and the implications for analyte adsorption losses rather than a specific connection between the two compounds."
