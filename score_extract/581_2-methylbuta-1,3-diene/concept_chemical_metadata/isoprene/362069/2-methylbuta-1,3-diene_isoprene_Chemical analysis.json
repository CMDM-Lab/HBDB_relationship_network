    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) relevant to biogenic emissions. However, the text primarily discusses analytical methods for measuring isoprene without detailing any specific relationship or interaction between the two compounds. They are grouped under the broader category of BVOCs, but no direct connection is established."
