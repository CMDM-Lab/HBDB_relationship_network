    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they both belong to the class of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The discussion focuses on isoprene's high volatility and emission rates compared to other BVOCs, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may share similar properties, although it is not explicitly mentioned in terms of its emission characteristics or significance in the study."
