    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) related to plant emissions. While isoprene emissions have been extensively studied in relation to environmental factors such as leaf development and temperature, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not detailed. They are likely part of the same category of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) but without direct interaction or comparison provided in the context."
