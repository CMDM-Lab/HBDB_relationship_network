    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that are influenced by environmental factors such as light and CO2 concentrations. While the text discusses isoprene emissions in relation to CO2 levels, it does not provide specific details on the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, indicating a general connection as BVOCs but lacking direct interaction or comparative analysis."
