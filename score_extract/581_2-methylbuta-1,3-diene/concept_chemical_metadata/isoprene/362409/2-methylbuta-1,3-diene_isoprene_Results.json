    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from foliage, particularly in relation to the emissions from Quercus alba. While isoprene is specifically noted for its emission patterns, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be part of the broader category of MNT compounds analyzed. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
