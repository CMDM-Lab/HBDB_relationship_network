    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) related to plant emissions. However, the text primarily discusses the mixing ratios and reactions of Î²-ocimene and camphene, with isoprene being referenced in relation to monoterpene values. There is no direct interaction or detailed relationship established between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene, indicating a more general association as VOCs rather than a specific functional connection."
