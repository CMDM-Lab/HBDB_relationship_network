    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants, particularly under stress conditions such as drought. The study discusses isoprene fluxes in relation to different oak species, implying that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may also play a role in similar emissions, although it is not explicitly mentioned. Their relationship is rooted in their shared characteristics as plant-emitted VOCs, but specific interactions or comparisons are not detailed."
