    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants, particularly oak species. The study examines isoprene emission rates from oak leaves during drought conditions, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may also be emitted in similar contexts. However, the specific relationship between these two compounds is not directly discussed, indicating a general association rather than a detailed interaction."
