    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) analyzed in relation to their emissions from leaves. The study focuses on measuring isoprene emissions and comparing them to monoterpene concentrations, indicating that both compounds are part of the same ecological and chemical analysis, but their specific relationship is not elaborated upon in detail."
