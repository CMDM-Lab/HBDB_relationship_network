    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is identified as isoprene, a volatile organic compound emitted by plants, particularly under stress conditions such as drought and heat. The study discusses the physiological and metabolic roles of isoprene in enhancing abiotic stress tolerance in plants, suggesting that isoprene emission may play a crucial role in maintaining photosynthetic efficiency during adverse environmental conditions. The relationship is significant as it highlights the protective function of isoprene in plant stress responses."
