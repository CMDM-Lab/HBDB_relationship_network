    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are closely related as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. The study discusses isoprene emissions from poplar plants under stress conditions, indicating that isoprene plays a role in plant responses to environmental stress. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their connection in this context."
