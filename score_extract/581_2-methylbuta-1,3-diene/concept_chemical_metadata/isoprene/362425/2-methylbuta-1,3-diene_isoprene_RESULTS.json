    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are closely related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by plants, particularly under stress conditions such as water scarcity. The study indicates that the loss of carbon as isoprene increased significantly in response to abiotic stress, suggesting that isoprene production may be a physiological response to environmental challenges, potentially linked to the metabolic pathways involving 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is a structural isomer of isoprene."
