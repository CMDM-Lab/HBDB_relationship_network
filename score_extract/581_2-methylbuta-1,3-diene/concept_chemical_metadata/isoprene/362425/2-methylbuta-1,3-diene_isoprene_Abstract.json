    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are closely related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by plants, particularly in the study of Grey poplar (Populus Ã— canescens). The research focuses on the dynamics of isoprene emission and its potential role in plant stress tolerance and recovery under climate change scenarios. The study aims to understand how isoprene emission affects photosynthesis and plant adaptation, indicating a significant relationship between the two compounds in the context of plant physiology and environmental response."
