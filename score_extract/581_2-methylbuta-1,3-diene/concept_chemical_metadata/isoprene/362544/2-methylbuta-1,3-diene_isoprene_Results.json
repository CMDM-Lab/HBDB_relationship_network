    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are emitted from rainforest and oil palm landscapes. The study highlights the sensitivity of ozone concentration to the emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes, indicating a potential relationship between these compounds in the context of air quality and environmental impact. However, the specific interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon, limiting the depth of their relationship."
