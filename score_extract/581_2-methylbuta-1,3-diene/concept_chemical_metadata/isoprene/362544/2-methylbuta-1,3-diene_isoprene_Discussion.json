    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as isoprene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be emitted by certain plants, including oil palms. The discussion highlights the potential for genetic modification of oil palm to reduce isoprene emissions, which could help mitigate ozone exceedances in the atmosphere. While both compounds are linked through their roles in air quality and emissions, the context does not delve deeply into their specific chemical relationship."
