    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The study discusses the emissions of isoprene alongside various monoterpenes in response to environmental factors like light intensity and temperature. While both compounds are mentioned in the context of BVOC emissions, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between them."
