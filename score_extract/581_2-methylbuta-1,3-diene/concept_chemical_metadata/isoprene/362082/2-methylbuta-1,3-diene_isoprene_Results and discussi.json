    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both classified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The discussion highlights the dependence of isoprene emissions on light intensity, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is implied to be related but not explicitly detailed. Both compounds are part of the broader study of seasonal variations in BVOC emissions, indicating a shared category but lacking a direct interaction or comparison."
