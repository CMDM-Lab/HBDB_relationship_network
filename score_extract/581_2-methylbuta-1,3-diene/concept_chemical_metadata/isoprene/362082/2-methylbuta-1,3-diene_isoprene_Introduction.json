    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both identified as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants. The study focuses on measuring BVOC emissions from various dominant plant species in the Kinki region of Japan, where isoprene is specifically mentioned among the ten most abundant BVOCs. However, the relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not explicitly detailed, indicating they are part of the same category of emissions without a direct interaction or comparison provided."
