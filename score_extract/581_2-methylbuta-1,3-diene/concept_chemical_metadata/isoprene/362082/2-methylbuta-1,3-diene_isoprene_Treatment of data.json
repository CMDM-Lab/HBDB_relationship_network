    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in plant emissions. The context discusses isoprene emissions and their dependence on environmental factors, while 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. Their relationship is primarily based on their chemical similarity and role in atmospheric chemistry, particularly in relation to plant emissions."
