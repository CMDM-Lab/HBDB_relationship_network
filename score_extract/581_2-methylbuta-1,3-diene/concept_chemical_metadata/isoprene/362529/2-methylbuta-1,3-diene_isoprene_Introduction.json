    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned in relation to breath analysis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While isoprene levels are noted to increase in CKD patients, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not directly discussed. They are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be relevant in breath analysis, but their interaction or comparative significance is not elaborated upon in the provided studies."
