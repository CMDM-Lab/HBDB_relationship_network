    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the exhaled breath of animals. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed. While isoprene is identified as one of the VOCs that differed significantly in CKD animals, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is not highlighted in relation to any specific physiological or biochemical interaction with isoprene, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two compounds in this study."
