    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as isoprene is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be produced from the metabolism of certain compounds, including 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene. The study discusses the elevation of exhaled isoprene in chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats, suggesting a metabolic link, although it does not directly explore the relationship between these two compounds. The focus is primarily on isoprene's role as a biomarker in CKD rather than a detailed interaction with 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene."
