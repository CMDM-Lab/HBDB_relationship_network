    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from fruitlets during a study on nutrient starvation and its effects on fruit development. Isoprene is highlighted as a candidate marker with a significant statistical score, suggesting its importance in the biological activities related to the fruit's response to abscisic acid (ABA) content. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association as VOCs rather than a direct interaction."
