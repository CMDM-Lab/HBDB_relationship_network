    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both isoprenoid compounds involved in plant biosynthesis. The expression of genes related to isoprene production, such as DXS, is crucial for the biosynthesis of these compounds in plants. However, the context does not provide detailed interactions or specific functional relationships between the two compounds beyond their classification as isoprenoids."
