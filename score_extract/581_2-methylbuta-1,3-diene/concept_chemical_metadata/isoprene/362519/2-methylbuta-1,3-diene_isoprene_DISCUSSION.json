    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is a structural isomer of isoprene. The discussion focuses on isoprene biosynthesis in apple fruitlets, suggesting that metabolic processes involving carbohydrates and hormones may influence isoprene production. However, the specific role of 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene in this biosynthesis is not explicitly detailed."
