    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and isoprene are related as they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be emitted by plants, particularly in relation to environmental monitoring and agricultural practices. The mention of isoprene highlights its significance in predicting fruit load, suggesting that 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene may share similar ecological roles or emissions patterns, although the specific relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed in the context."
