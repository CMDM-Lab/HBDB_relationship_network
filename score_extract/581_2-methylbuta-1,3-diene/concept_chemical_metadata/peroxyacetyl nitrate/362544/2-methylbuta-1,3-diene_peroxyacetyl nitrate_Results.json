    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is indirectly related to peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) through their roles in atmospheric chemistry. The increase in PAN concentrations over the oil palm plantation is attributed to enhanced photochemical processing of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like isoprene and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This suggests that isoprene emissions contribute to the formation of PAN, although the specific interaction between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and PAN is not explicitly detailed."
