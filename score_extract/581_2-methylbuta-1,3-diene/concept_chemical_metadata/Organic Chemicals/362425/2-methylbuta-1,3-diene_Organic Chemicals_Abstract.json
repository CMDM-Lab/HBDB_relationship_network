    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed as a biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by plants, particularly in forest ecosystems. It plays a significant role in carbon exchange and influences atmospheric chemistry. The relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and organic chemicals is established through its classification as a VOC, which contributes to the overall emissions of organic compounds from vegetation, impacting air quality and climate."
