    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to organic chemicals as it is a type of volatile organic compound (VOC) that may be emitted during the abscission process in apple fruitlets. The study focuses on the metabolic changes and volatile emissions associated with fruitlet abscission, highlighting the role of organic chemicals like isoprene as markers for this process. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and the broader category of organic chemicals is not explicitly detailed."
