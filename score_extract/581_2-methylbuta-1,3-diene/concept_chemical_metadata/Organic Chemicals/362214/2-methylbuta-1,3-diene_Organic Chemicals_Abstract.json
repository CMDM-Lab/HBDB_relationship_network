    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed as a significant volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by various plants. The relationship to organic chemicals is established through isoprene's classification as an organic compound and its role in plant metabolism, particularly in the synthesis process involving dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). The discussion highlights isoprene's importance in both ecological and atmospheric contexts, linking it to broader categories of organic chemicals."
