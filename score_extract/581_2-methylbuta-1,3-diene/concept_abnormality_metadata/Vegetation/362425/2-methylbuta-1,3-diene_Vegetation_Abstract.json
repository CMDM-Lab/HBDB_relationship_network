    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is highlighted as a significant biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted by vegetation, particularly forest ecosystems. The emission of isoprene plays a crucial role in carbon exchange and can influence atmospheric chemistry, climate, and ecosystem processes. The relationship is underscored by the fact that isoprene synthesis is tightly regulated by environmental factors affecting plant physiology."
