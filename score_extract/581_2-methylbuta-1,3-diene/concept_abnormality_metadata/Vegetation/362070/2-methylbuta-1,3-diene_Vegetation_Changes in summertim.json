    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to vegetation through its emissions, which significantly influence surface ozone levels. The text discusses how changes in vegetation, particularly due to factors like CO2 levels and stomatal conductance, affect isoprene emissions and consequently impact air quality and ecosystem health. This relationship highlights the role of vegetation in modulating atmospheric chemistry through isoprene emissions."
