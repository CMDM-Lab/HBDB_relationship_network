    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is linked to vegetation as its emissions are projected to increase significantly due to changes in vegetation distribution by 2100. The study indicates that isoprene emissions are influenced by the state of vegetation, with a notable reduction in emissions when accounting for future vegetation changes. This highlights the ecological relationship between isoprene emissions and vegetation dynamics under climate change scenarios."
