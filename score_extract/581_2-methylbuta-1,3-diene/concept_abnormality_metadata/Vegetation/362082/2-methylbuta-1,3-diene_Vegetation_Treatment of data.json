    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to its emissions from vegetation, specifically from the biomass of plants. The study quantifies biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, including isoprene, based on the dry weight of leaves from various types of vegetation. The relationship is significant as the emission rates are calculated per gram of biomass, indicating that the amount of vegetation directly influences the emission of isoprene."
