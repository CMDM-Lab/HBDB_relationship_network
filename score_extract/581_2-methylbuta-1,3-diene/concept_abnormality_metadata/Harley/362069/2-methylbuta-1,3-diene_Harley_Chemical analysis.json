    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to various analytical methods for measuring volatile organic compounds, including references to Harley et al. (1996) who contributed to the understanding of isoprene emissions. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Harley is not elaborated upon, as Harley is cited primarily in the context of measurement techniques rather than a direct interaction or significant finding related to isoprene itself."
