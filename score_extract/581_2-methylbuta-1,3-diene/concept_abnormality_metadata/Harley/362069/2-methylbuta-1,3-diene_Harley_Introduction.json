    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to the research conducted by Harley and others on its emissions from leaves and branches. The studies referenced focus on the characterization of isoprene emissions concerning various environmental factors. However, the relationship is primarily about the measurement and analysis of isoprene rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and Harley."
