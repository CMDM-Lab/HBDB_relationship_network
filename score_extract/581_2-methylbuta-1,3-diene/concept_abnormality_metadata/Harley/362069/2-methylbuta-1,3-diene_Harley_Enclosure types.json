    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is discussed in relation to studies conducted by Harley et al. on BVOC (biogenic volatile organic compound) emissions from leaves. The mention of Harley indicates that the research focuses on the effects of environmental factors on isoprene emissions, highlighting the significance of leaf cuvettes in measuring these emissions. However, the relationship is primarily about the study of isoprene rather than a direct interaction with Harley as a person or entity."
