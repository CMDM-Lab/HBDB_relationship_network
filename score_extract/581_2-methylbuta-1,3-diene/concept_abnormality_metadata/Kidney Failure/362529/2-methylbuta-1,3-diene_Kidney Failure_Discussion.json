    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to kidney failure through its association with isoprene, a compound whose levels significantly increase in the exhaled breath of animals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study highlights that isoprene production is elevated following subtotal nephrectomy, suggesting a metabolic change in response to renal failure. However, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and kidney failure is not directly established, as the mechanism linking them remains unclear."
