    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, which is a component of isoprene, is linked to end-stage renal failure (ESRF) through the observation of elevated exhaled isoprene levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRF. The increase in isoprene is associated with hypercholesterolemia and proteinuria in CKD models, suggesting a metabolic connection between isoprene production and renal dysfunction. The findings indicate that isoprene levels may serve as a biomarker for renal health status, particularly in ESRF patients undergoing hemodialysis."
