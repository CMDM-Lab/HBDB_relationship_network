    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, also known as isoprene, is mentioned in relation to gas exchange measurements and the analysis of its oxidation products. However, there is no direct discussion or connection to the RPL10 gene, which is involved in ribosomal protein synthesis. The two terms appear in the same context but do not interact or relate to each other functionally or biologically."
