    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene (isoprene) is mentioned in relation to plant stress responses, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of the RPL10 gene, which is typically associated with ribosomal protein synthesis. The relationship between isoprene emissions and the RPL10 gene is not established, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms in this context."
