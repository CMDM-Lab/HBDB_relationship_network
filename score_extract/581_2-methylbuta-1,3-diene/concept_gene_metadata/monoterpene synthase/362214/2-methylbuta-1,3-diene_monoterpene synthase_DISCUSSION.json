    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene is indirectly related to monoterpene synthase through the discussion of enzyme kinetics and substrate interactions in the isoprene biosynthetic pathway. The text highlights the Km values for isoprene synthase and related monoterpene synthases, indicating that while both enzymes are involved in similar metabolic processes, the specific relationship between 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene and monoterpene synthase is not explicitly detailed. The focus is more on the kinetic properties of the enzymes rather than a direct interaction with the compound itself."
