    "summary": "In this context, 2-methylbuta-1,3-diene, commonly known as isoprene, is synthesized in chloroplasts from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by isoprene synthase, an enzyme related to monoterpene synthases. While both enzymes are involved in the synthesis of terpenes, isoprene synthase has a significantly lower substrate affinity compared to monoterpene synthases, indicating a distinct functional relationship in terpene biosynthesis pathways."
