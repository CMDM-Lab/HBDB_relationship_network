    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is evaluated alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for its effects on peak current amplitude during step depolarization experiments. The data suggests that the presence of PERC, along with TCE and TOL, influences the current responses at various test potentials, indicating a relationship between these VOCs and the depolarization process in the studied system. However, the specific role of PERC in the depolarization mechanism is not detailed, leaving the relationship somewhat ambiguous."
