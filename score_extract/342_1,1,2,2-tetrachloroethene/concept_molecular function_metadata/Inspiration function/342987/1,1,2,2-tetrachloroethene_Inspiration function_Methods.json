    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned as a vapor generated for exposure testing in operant-inhalation chambers. However, there is no direct discussion regarding its impact on inspiration function or respiratory effects. The focus is primarily on the measurement and control of vapor concentrations rather than any physiological implications related to inspiration function."
