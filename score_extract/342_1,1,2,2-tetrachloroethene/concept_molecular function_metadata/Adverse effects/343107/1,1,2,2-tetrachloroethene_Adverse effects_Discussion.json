    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is highlighted for its adverse behavioral effects at lower exposure concentrations compared to toluene (TOL). The study indicates that PERC is more potent than TOL, particularly at low concentrations, leading to significant adverse effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This suggests a direct relationship between PERC exposure and negative behavioral outcomes, emphasizing the importance of understanding its toxicological impact."
