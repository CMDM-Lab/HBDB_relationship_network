    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is mentioned alongside toluene (TOL) in a study analyzing the effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on receptor sensitivity. However, there is no direct discussion of drug interactions related to PERC or TOL. The focus is on the concentration-effect relationships of these solvents rather than any pharmacological interactions, indicating a lack of relevance between PERC and drug interactions in this analysis."
