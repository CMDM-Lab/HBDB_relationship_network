    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) is being studied for its effects on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), specifically α4β2 and α7 subtypes, which are important in the central nervous system (CNS). The research aims to compare the receptor inhibition profiles of PERC with those of toluene (TOL) to understand their behavioral effects and toxicodynamic sensitivity. This indicates a direct relationship between PERC and receptor inhibition, as the study focuses on how PERC influences nAChR activity, which is crucial for understanding its neurotoxic effects."
