    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that affects ion currents (ICa) in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of 'obstruction' in relation to TCE or its effects on cellular functions. The term 'obstruction' does not appear to be relevant to the described effects of TCE on ion currents, indicating a lack of connection between the two terms."
