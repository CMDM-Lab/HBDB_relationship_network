    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose concentrations were measured over time, indicating its presence in the environment. The term 'evolution' refers to the changes in VOC concentrations observed during the sampling period, influenced by factors such as waste truck activity and atmospheric conditions. However, there is no direct biological or chemical relationship established between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the concept of evolution in a biological sense."
