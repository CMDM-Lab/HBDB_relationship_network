    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its effects on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) and its potency as an inhibitor compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights that TCE has a lower potency as an inhibitor of behavioral despair compared to PERC, indicating that TCE's inhibitory effects are less significant. However, the specific mechanisms by which TCE acts as an inhibitor are not thoroughly examined, leaving the relationship somewhat vague."
