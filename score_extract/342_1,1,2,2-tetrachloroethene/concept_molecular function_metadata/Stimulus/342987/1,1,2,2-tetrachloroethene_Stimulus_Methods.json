    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is not directly mentioned, but the study focuses on perchloroethylene (PCE) vapor exposure in operant-inhalation chambers, which may serve as a stimulus for behavioral testing in rats. The relationship between PCE and the stimulus is implied through the controlled exposure conditions, but there is no explicit connection to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene or its effects as a stimulus."
