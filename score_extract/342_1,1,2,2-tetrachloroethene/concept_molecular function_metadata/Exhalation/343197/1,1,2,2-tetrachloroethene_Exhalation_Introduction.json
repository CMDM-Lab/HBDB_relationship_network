    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is highlighted as a model compound for studying biological monitoring through exhalation. The text indicates that a significant portion of tetrachloroethene absorbed by humans is exhaled unchanged, making it an effective marker for respiratory elimination. This relationship underscores the compound's relevance in assessing exposure through breath analysis."
