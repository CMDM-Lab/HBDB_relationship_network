    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is highlighted as a solvent that accumulates in fatty tissues, leading to its presence in exhaled air samples taken 16 hours post-exposure. The study indicates that repeated daily exposure results in progressive accumulation, which is reflected in the elevated levels of this compound in exhalation samples, suggesting a direct relationship between the solvent's accumulation in the body and its subsequent exhalation."
