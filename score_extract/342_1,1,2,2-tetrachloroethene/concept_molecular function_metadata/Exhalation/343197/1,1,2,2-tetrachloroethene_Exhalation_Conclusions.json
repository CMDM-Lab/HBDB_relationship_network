    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is analyzed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be monitored through exhalation. The study discusses the use of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for sampling and quantifying this compound in the exhaled breath of individuals exposed occupationally. The method demonstrates good repeatability and linearity in calibration, indicating its effectiveness for biological monitoring of VOCs in breath samples."
