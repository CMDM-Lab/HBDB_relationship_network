    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and membrane potentials are discussed in relation to the effects of lipophilic compounds on cellular membranes. The study indicates that neither PERC nor toluene (TOL) altered resting membrane potentials in oocytes, suggesting that these compounds do not significantly perturb membrane activity or influence ion channel function, which is critical for maintaining membrane potentials."
