    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as one of the analytes being evaluated for statistical estimation methods. The discussion focuses on the performance of various estimation techniques in the presence of censored data, highlighting that the robust imputation method shows little improvement for this analyte. However, the relationship is primarily statistical rather than chemical or biological, indicating that 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is simply one of several analytes under consideration in the analysis."
