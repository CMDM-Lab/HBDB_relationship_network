    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed in relation to toxicokinetics, particularly regarding species sensitivity differences between humans and rats. The text highlights that toxicokinetic factors may contribute to the observed differences in sensitivity to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene, suggesting that understanding these differences is crucial for assessing human health risks associated with exposure to such compounds. However, the specific toxicokinetic properties of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene are not detailed, limiting the depth of the relationship."
