    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned in relation to a method for measuring its presence in exhaled breath samples from an occupationally exposed individual. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears without any clear connection to the measurement or analysis of tetrachloroethene, indicating that it is not directly relevant to the chemical analysis or its implications in the study."
