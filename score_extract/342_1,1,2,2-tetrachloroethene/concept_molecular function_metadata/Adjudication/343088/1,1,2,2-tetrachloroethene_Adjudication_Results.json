    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) studied for its effects on ion currents (ICa) in a statistical analysis. However, there is no direct mention or discussion of 'adjudication' in relation to TCE or its effects. The term 'adjudication' appears unrelated to the chemical analysis presented, indicating a lack of connection between the two terms."
