    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned as a target compound for exposure assessment in a dry-cleaning shop, where a specific sampling process using nanoplatelets graphene was optimized for its detection. The relationship between PCE and the sampling process is indirect, as the focus is on the methodology for quantifying PCE exposure rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship between the two."
