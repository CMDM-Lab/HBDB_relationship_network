    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like toluene and perchloroethylene, which are used in various industrial processes. The discussion focuses on the neurotoxic effects of these VOCs and their common mechanisms of action, suggesting that 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is part of a broader category of substances that impact central nervous system function through similar processes. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and the term 'Process' is not explicitly detailed."
