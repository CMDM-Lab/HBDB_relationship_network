    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a chlorinated ethylene solvent that, along with other chlorinated ethylenes like trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene, poses risks in contaminated groundwater. However, the relationship between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and ethylenes is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on the environmental impact and remediation of chlorinated solvents rather than a direct chemical or functional relationship with ethylenes."
