    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed in relation to its degradation process, which involves anaerobic hydrogenâ€“halogen substitution leading to the formation of other chlorinated compounds. However, there is no mention of hydrogen as a relevant factor in this degradation or any connection to homeopathic preparations. The terms appear without a direct relationship."
