    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) alongside other chlorinated hydrocarbons. While it is categorized under halogenated hydrocarbons, the term 'aliphatic hydrocarbon' generally refers to a broader class of hydrocarbons that do not contain halogens. The relationship is weak as the context does not provide specific interactions or relevance between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and aliphatic hydrocarbons, focusing instead on the environmental impact of VOCs."
