    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and decane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in high concentrations due to their common use as solvents and in cleaning products. However, the context does not provide any specific interaction or relationship between the two compounds beyond their co-occurrence in the emissions from waste tipping activities. They are part of a broader discussion on VOC emissions but lack a direct connection."
