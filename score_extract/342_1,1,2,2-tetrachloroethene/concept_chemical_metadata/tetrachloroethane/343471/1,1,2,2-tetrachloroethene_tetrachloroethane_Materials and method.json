    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and tetrachloroethane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in water samples using gas chromatography. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical relationship or interactions. They are part of a broader list of VOCs studied for environmental monitoring, indicating they share a category but lack specific relevance to each other."
