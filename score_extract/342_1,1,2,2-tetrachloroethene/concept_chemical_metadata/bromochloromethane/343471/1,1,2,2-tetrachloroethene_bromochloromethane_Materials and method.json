    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and bromochloromethane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in water samples using purge-and-trap gas chromatography. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions, toxicological effects, or any specific relationship beyond their inclusion in the same analytical procedure for VOC detection."
