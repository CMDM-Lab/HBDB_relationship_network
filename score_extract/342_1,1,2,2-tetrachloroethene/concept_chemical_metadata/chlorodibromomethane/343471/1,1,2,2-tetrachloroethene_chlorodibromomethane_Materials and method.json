    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and chlorodibromomethane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in water samples using purge-and-trap gas chromatography. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship, interactions, or comparative significance in the study. They are simply part of a broader list of VOCs being investigated for environmental quality."
