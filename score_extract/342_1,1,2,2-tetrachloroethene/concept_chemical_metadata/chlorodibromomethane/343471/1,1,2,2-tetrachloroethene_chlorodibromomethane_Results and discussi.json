    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and chlorodibromomethane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in water samples from various rivers and lakes. However, the context does not provide any specific information about their interactions, chemical properties, or any significant relationship beyond their co-occurrence in the same environmental study. They are simply listed among other VOCs without further elaboration on their relevance to each other."
