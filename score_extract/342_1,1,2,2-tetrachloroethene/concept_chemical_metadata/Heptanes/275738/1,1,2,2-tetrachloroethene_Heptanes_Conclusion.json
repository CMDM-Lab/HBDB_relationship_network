    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and heptanes are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high concentrations measured near a compaction vehicle. The study highlights the environmental impact of these VOCs, noting that their concentrations can vary significantly due to temperature and wind conditions. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or health implications in relation to each other."
