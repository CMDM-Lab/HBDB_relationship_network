    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and heptanes are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected at high concentrations in the vicinity of waste tipping operations. They are part of a broader list of VOCs that are commonly used as solvents and are released during waste management activities. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships beyond their presence in the same environmental study."
