    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed as a solvent used in metal cleaning operations, indicating a potential relationship with metals. However, the focus is primarily on the analysis and biological monitoring of tetrachloroethene rather than a direct interaction with metals. The mention of metals is incidental to the discussion of tetrachloroethene's applications and metabolism."
