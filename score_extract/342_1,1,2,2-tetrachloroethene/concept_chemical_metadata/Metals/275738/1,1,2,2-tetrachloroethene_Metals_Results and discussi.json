    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed in relation to its degradation products, particularly trichloroethylene, which is used for metal cleaning. The presence of tetrachloroethene and its breakdown products highlights their relevance in the context of metal cleaning processes. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the emissions and degradation rather than a direct interaction with metals themselves."
