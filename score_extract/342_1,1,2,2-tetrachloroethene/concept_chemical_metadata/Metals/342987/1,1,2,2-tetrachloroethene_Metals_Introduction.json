    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned among various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in groundwater, particularly in areas influenced by industrial and agricultural activities. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with metals. While metals may be present in contaminated sites, the context does not establish a clear connection between 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and metals, focusing instead on the neurotoxic effects of VOCs like perchloroethylene."
