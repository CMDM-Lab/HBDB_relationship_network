    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and toluene (TOL) are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that inhibit voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in a manner similar to volatile anesthetics. The study suggests that their effects on VSCC may contribute to the neurotoxicity associated with VOC exposure, highlighting their relevance in understanding the risks of solvent exposure and its impact on the central nervous system (CNS)."
