    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and toluene (TOL) are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit neurotoxic effects when exposed to sufficient concentrations. The study highlights how these VOCs can disrupt voltage-sensitive calcium channel function in neurons, contributing to acute neurotoxicity. However, while they are mentioned together in the context of their effects on the central nervous system, the specific relationship between PERC and TOL is not deeply explored beyond their shared classification and neurotoxic potential."
