    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PERC) and toluene (TOL) are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) examined for their effects on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. The study investigates the interactions of these VOCs with VSCC function, including their inhibitory effects on calcium currents. While both compounds are part of the same experimental setup, the specific relationship between them is not deeply explored beyond their shared role in affecting cellular function."
