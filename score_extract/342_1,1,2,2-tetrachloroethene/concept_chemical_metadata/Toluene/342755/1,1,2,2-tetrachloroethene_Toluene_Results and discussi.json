    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) evaluated for their presence in air samples from vehicle repair shops. The method quantitation limits (MQL) for both compounds are provided, indicating their detection thresholds in the studied environment. However, there is no direct discussion of their interactions or specific relevance to each other beyond their classification as VOCs and their quantification in the same study."
