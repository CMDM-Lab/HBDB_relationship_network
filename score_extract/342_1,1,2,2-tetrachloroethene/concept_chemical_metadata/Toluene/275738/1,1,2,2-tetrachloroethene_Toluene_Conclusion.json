    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the air near a compaction vehicle. The study highlights their concentrations, indicating that both chemicals are present in the same environment and subject to similar factors affecting their release and dispersion. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or health implications related to each other."
