    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with seasonal concentration variations. The data indicates that their concentrations are correlated at certain sites, suggesting they may share similar sources or be influenced by meteorological conditions. However, the context does not provide specific details on their direct interactions or functional relationships beyond their co-occurrence and correlation in atmospheric measurements."
