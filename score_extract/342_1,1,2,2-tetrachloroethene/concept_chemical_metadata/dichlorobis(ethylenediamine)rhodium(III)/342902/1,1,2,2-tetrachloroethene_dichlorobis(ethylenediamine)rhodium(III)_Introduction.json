    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) are not directly related. The discussion focuses on the transport and dynamics of various chlorinated volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) in an aquifer, with no mention of dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)rhodium(III) or its interactions with 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene. The context primarily addresses the behavior of Cl-VOCs in the subsurface environment, lacking any specific connection to the rhodium complex."
