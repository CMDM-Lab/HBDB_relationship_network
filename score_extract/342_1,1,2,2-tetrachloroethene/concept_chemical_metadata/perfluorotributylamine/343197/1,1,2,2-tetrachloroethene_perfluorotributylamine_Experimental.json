    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and perfluorotributylamine are both mentioned in relation to mass spectrometry analysis. Perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) is used as a standard for autotuning the mass spectrometer, while 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is analyzed for its retention time. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their roles in the analytical process."
