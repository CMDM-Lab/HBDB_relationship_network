    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a compound that can degrade into trichloroethylene through biochemical processes involving halogens. The relationship highlights the role of halogens in the degradation pathways of chlorinated solvents, indicating that halogens are integral to the chemical behavior and transformation of tetrachloroethene. However, the discussion does not delve deeply into the specific interactions or mechanisms involving halogens beyond their role in the degradation process."
