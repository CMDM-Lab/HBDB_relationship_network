    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (TCE) is mentioned alongside other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like toluene and perchloroethylene (PERC) in relation to their effects on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in PC12 cells. However, 2-naphthylethyl methacrylate is not discussed or linked to TCE or the study's focus on VOC interactions with VSCC function. Therefore, there is no direct relationship established between these two compounds in the provided context."
