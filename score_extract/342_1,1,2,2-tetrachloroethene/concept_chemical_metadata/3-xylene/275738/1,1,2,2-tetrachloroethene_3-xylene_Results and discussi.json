    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in high concentrations during the emission monitoring of waste tipping activities. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their presence in the same environmental study, indicating they are part of a broader category of VOCs commonly found in similar settings."
