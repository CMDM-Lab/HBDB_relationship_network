    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene and bromoform are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in water samples using purge-and-trap gas chromatography. However, there is no discussion of their specific interactions, chemical relationships, or shared significance beyond their inclusion in the list of studied VOCs. They are treated as separate entities in the analytical procedure without any direct relevance to each other."
