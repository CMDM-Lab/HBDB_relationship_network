    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is discussed primarily as a model compound for studying environmental contaminants and their metabolic processes in humans. However, there is no mention or connection to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, which is a disease caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by fleas.
