    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) found in a car repair shop, where it is used for cleaning motor engines. However, there is no discussion or evidence linking this compound to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, a disease transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect relationship established between them."
