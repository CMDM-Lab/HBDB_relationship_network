    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is discussed primarily in relation to its monitoring in a dry-cleaning environment as a volatile organic compound (VOC). There is no mention or implication of a relationship between PCE and Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, which is a disease caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect connection."
