    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethene (PCE) is mentioned in relation to air sampling techniques used to assess exposure levels in a dry-cleaning environment. However, there is no discussion or evidence linking PCE to Endemic Flea-Borne Typhus, which is a disease caused by Rickettsia typhi and transmitted by fleas. The two terms appear in separate contexts without any direct or indirect relationship."
