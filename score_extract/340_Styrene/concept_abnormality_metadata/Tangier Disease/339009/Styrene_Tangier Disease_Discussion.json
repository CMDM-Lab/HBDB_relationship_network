    "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its inhalation exposure and potential effects on human immune cells. However, there is no direct mention or evidence linking styrene to Tangier Disease, a genetic disorder affecting lipid metabolism and characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The relationship between styrene exposure and Tangier Disease is not established, indicating a lack of direct relevance."
