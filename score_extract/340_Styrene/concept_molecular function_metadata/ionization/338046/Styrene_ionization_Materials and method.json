    "summary": "In this context, styrene is analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a helium ionization detector, indicating a direct relationship between styrene and the ionization process. The ionization detector is crucial for measuring the concentration of styrene in the synthetic wastewater, demonstrating how ionization is employed to quantify the presence of styrene in the liquid phase. This highlights the importance of ionization in the analytical methods used for styrene detection."
