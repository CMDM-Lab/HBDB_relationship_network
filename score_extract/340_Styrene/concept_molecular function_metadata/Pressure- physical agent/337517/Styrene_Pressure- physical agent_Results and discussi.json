    "summary": "In this context, styrene is being separated through a membrane module, where the separation efficiency is influenced by the pressure differences (P d) between the feed-side and permeate-side. The relationship indicates that higher pressure can enhance the transport of styrene across the membrane, thereby affecting its concentration in the permeate. The study emphasizes the importance of optimizing pressure conditions to improve styrene separation from off-gas emissions."
