    "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to a biofiltration system designed to treat fluctuating styrene loads effectively. The pressure differences across gas membrane modules are mentioned as a factor in optimizing the treatment process, indicating that pressure is a physical agent influencing the retention and degradation of styrene by specific microbial species. Thus, while styrene is the target compound, pressure plays a critical role in the operational efficiency of the biofiltration system."
