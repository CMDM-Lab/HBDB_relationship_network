    "summary": "In this context, styrene is identified as a weakly electrophilic thiol-reactive toxic chemical that potentially impacts the flocculation process in activated sludge. The activation of the glutathione-gated potassium efflux (GGKE) system in response to styrene may lead to the weakening and disintegration of the floc structure, suggesting a relationship between styrene exposure and deflocculation. However, the specific effects of styrene on sludge flocculation have not been previously studied, indicating a need for further research to confirm this hypothesis."
