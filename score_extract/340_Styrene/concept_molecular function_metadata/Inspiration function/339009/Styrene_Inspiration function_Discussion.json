    "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its potential effects on human immune cells and its inhalation by individuals in occupational settings, such as styrene processing plants and heavy smokers. While the text highlights the biological relevance of styrene exposure, it does not explicitly connect styrene to inspiration function or respiratory effects. The focus is more on immunomodulatory and carcinogenic properties rather than direct implications for respiratory function."
