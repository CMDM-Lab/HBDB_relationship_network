    "summary": "In this context, styrene is the target compound undergoing catalytic incineration using a MnO/Fe2O3 catalyst. The study evaluates different kinetic models to understand the reaction kinetics involved in the catalytic process. The findings indicate that the Langmuirâ€“Hinshelwood model is the most suitable for describing the catalytic behavior, highlighting the critical role of the catalyst in facilitating the incineration of styrene."
