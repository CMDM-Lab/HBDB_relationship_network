    "summary": "In this context, styrene is identified as a weakly electrophilic thiol-reactive toxic chemical that may cause deflocculation of activated sludge due to shock loading. The authors hypothesize that the increase in organic loading rate (OLR) of styrene, when hydraulic retention time (HRT) was reduced, led to a shock effect on the sludge, resulting in the weakening of the floc structure. This suggests a potential relationship between styrene exposure and the shock response in the activated sludge system, although further studies are needed for confirmation."
