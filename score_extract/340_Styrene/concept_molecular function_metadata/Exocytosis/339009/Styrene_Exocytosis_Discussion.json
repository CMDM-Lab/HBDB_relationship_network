    "summary": "In this context, styrene-7.8-oxide (SO) is investigated for its immunomodulating effects, particularly on cytokine secretion from human mononuclear cells. The study indicates that within certain concentrations, SO stimulates cytokine secretion, which may involve exocytosis as a mechanism for cytokine release. However, the specific role of exocytosis in this process is not explicitly detailed, leaving the relationship somewhat implied rather than directly established."
