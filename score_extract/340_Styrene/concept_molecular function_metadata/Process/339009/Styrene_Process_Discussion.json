    "summary": "In this context, styrene is linked to the process of occupational exposure in processing plants, where its metabolite, styrene-7.8-oxide, may stimulate immune responses in individuals exposed to high concentrations. The study highlights the biological and clinical relevance of styrene exposure, particularly its carcinogenic, genotoxic, and immunomodulatory effects, emphasizing the importance of understanding these processes for individuals in high-risk environments, such as heavy smokers and workers in styrene processing."
