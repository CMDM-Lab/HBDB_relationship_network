    "summary": "In this context, styrene is directly related to the process of treating synthetic wastewater using a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The study focuses on assessing the performance of the MBR process specifically for styrene removal mechanisms and membrane fouling at varying hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The characteristics of the synthetic wastewater are designed to simulate petrochemical wastewater, indicating that the process is tailored to effectively manage styrene concentrations in the effluent."
