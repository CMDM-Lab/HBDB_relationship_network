    "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its removal during a membrane bioreactor (MBR) process. The study indicates that styrene removal is primarily biological rather than through adsorption or volatilization. The MBR process demonstrates high removal efficiencies with minimal styrene volatilization, highlighting the effectiveness of biological processes in treating VOCs like styrene in wastewater management."
