    "summary": "In this context, styrene is directly related to the process of biodegradation within a biofiltration column. The study discusses how styrene is recharged into the system, maintaining a concentration that supports styrene-degrading microorganisms. The process involves multiple metabolic steps to convert styrene into carbon dioxide and water, with specific microbial species specializing in different stages of degradation. This highlights the critical role of the biodegradation process in managing styrene levels and the importance of microbial diversity in effectively carrying out this process."
