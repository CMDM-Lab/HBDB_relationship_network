    "summary": "In this context, styrene is linked to its main metabolite, styrene-7.8-oxide (SO), which is investigated for its effects on the human immune response. The study aims to explore how SO, particularly its enantiomers, modulates cytokine production in mononuclear leukocyte cultures, indicating a direct relationship between styrene exposure and its metabolic effects on immune function."
