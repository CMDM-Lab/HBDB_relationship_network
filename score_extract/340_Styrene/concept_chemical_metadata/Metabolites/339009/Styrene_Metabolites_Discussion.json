    "summary": "In this context, styrene is directly related to its metabolite, styrene-7,8-oxide, which is highlighted for its toxicity and potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. The study investigates the immunomodulating capacities of styrene-7,8-oxide, indicating a significant relationship between styrene and its metabolites in terms of biological impact, particularly on cytokine secretion in human mononuclear cells."
