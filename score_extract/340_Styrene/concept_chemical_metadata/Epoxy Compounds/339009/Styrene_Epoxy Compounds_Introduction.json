    "summary": "In this context, styrene is discussed in relation to its metabolism into styrene-7,8-oxide (SO), which is an epoxy compound. SO, characterized by its reactive epoxide ring, is responsible for the toxic effects associated with styrene exposure. This indicates a direct relationship where styrene is a precursor to the formation of epoxy compounds, specifically SO, which has significant biological implications due to its reactivity and toxicity."
