    "summary": "In this context, styrene and styrene oxide (SO) are related through the investigation of SO as the main metabolite of styrene in the human body. The study aims to explore how SO may modulate the human immune response, particularly in relation to allergic diseases, which have been linked to styrene exposure. However, the specific interactions between styrene and SO in terms of immune modulation are not well-documented, indicating a need for further research."
