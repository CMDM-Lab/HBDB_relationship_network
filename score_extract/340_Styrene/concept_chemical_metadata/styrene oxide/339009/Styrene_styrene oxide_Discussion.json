    "summary": "In this context, styrene and styrene oxide (SO) are related through their concentrations and effects on human immune cells. The study suggests that the biological and clinical relevance of inhaling styrene or SO is significant for individuals exposed occupationally, indicating that both compounds may have stimulating effects on immune responses. Styrene is noted for its carcinogenic and genotoxic potential, while SO is highlighted for its short half-life and possible immunomodulatory effects, emphasizing their interconnected roles in health risks associated with exposure."
