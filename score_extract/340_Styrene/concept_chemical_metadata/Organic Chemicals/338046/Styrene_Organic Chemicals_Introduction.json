    "summary": "In this context, styrene is identified as a significant aromatic organic chemical used in the production of various commercially important products, including polystyrene and ABS. The discussion highlights the environmental impact of styrene release and its treatment through conventional activated sludge processes (CASPs), which are commonly employed for degrading hazardous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like styrene. This establishes a clear relationship between styrene and the broader category of organic chemicals, particularly in terms of its applications and environmental management."
