    "summary": "In this context, styrene is described as a thiol-reactive toxic chemical, suggesting a potential interaction with sulfhydryl compounds, which contain thiol groups. The text implies that styrene may influence sludge flocculation and metabolic activity in activated sludge systems, possibly through its reactivity with sulfhydryl groups. However, the specific mechanisms or effects of this interaction are not fully explored, indicating a need for further research."
