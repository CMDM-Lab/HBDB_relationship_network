    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is one of the volatile compounds analyzed during the optimization of the headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) process. The study focuses on improving extraction efficiency by selecting appropriate fibers and conditions for isolating volatile compounds from pleural effusions. While 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is included in the optimization process, the relationship is primarily procedural rather than indicating a direct interaction or significance beyond its role in the extraction methodology."
