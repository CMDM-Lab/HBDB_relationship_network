    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the major volatile compounds analyzed during the optimization of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) parameters. The study focuses on extracting volatile substances from pleural effusions, indicating that 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is part of a broader category of volatile compounds being investigated for their extraction efficiency. However, the specific interactions or implications of 2-ethylhexan-1-ol within the group of volatile substances are not elaborated upon in detail."
