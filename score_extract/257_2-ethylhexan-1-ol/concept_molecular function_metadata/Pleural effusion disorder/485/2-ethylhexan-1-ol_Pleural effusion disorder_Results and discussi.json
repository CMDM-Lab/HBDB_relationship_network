    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as a potential urinary biomarker for lung cancer, with its presence significantly increased in the headspace of cancerous cells compared to controls. The study suggests that it may help differentiate malignant from benign pleural effusions, indicating a potential diagnostic relevance in pleural effusion disorders related to lung cancer. However, further validation is needed to confirm its suitability as a biomarker."
