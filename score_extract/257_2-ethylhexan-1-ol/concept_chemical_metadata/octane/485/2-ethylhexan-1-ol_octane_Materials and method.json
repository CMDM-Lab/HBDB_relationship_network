    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and octane are both mentioned as compounds analyzed using mass spectrometry (MS) with specific ionization techniques. However, their relationship is limited to their presence in the same analytical procedure without any discussion of their chemical interactions, properties, or significance in relation to each other. They are simply part of a list of compounds analyzed for their peak areas in the MS measurements."
