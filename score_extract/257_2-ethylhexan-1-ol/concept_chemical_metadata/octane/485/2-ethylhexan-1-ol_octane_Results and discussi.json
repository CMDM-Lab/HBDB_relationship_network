    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and octane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed during the characterization of metabolites in pleural effusions. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the list of compounds measured for detection limits and repeatability of the extraction method. There is no indication of interaction or specific relevance between the two compounds in the study."
