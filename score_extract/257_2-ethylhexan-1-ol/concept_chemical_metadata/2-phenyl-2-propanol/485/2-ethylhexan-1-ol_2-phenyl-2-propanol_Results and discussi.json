    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and 2-phenyl-2-propanol are both identified as metabolites present in significantly higher levels in malignant effusions compared to benign effusions, with fold changes greater than 14.0. This suggests that both compounds may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing between malignant and benign conditions, indicating their relevance in the study of cancer diagnostics."
