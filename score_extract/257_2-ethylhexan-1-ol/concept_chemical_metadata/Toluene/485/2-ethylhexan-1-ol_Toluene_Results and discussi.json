    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed using solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. However, their relationship is not explicitly discussed beyond their inclusion in the study of volatile organic metabolites in pleural effusions. The context primarily focuses on the extraction method and detection limits rather than any direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds."
