    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and cyclohexanone are both identified as urinary biomarkers for lung cancer. Cyclohexanone is linked to metabolic conditions associated with advanced cancer, while 2-ethylhexan-1-ol shows a significant increase in cancerous cell headspace compared to controls. Both compounds are considered potential candidates for differentiating malignant from benign pleural effusions, indicating a shared relevance in cancer diagnostics."
