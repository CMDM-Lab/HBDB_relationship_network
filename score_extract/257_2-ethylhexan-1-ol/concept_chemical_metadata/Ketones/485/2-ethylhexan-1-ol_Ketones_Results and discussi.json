    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is categorized as an alcohol, which, along with ketones, forms part of the metabolomic profile analyzed in malignant and benign effusions. The study highlights that both ketones and alcohols, including 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, show significant differences in their relative abundances between malignant and benign groups, indicating a potential role in distinguishing between these conditions. However, the specific interaction or functional relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and ketones is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as part of the same chemical profile."
