    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the metabolites that significantly differ between malignant and benign pleural effusions. The study highlights that among the 36 identified metabolites, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, along with cyclohexanone, shows a marked increase in malignant cases, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for differentiating between the two types of effusions. This indicates a direct relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the broader category of metabolites analyzed in the study."
