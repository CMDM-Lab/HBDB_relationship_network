    "summary": "In this context, 2-ethylhexan-1-ol is identified as one of the major metabolites in the metabolomic profile of malignant effusions, while the TERT gene is not directly mentioned or linked to the analysis of these metabolites. The study focuses on the differences in volatile metabolites between benign and malignant groups, but does not establish a clear relationship between 2-ethylhexan-1-ol and the TERT gene, which is typically associated with telomerase activity and cancer biology. Therefore, their connection remains unclear within this specific context."
