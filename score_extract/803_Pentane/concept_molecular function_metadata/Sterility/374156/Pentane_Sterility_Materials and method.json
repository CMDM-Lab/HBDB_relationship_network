    "summary": "In this context, pentane is used as a feeding substrate in a bioreactor system, while sterility is emphasized during the extraction of biomass. The process involves maintaining sterile conditions when handling the solid supports to prevent contamination, ensuring that microbial activity is preserved. However, the relationship between pentane and sterility is indirect, as pentane's role is primarily as a substrate rather than a factor influencing sterility directly."
