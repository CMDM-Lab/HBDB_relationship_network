    "summary": "In this context, pentane is linked to the adaptation of fungal biomass in a biofilter system for its biodegradation. The study indicates that the fungal biomass adapted to effectively remove n-pentane, as evidenced by a significant increase in elimination capacity (EC) over time. This adaptation is crucial for optimizing the biodegradation process, highlighting the relationship between pentane and the biological adaptation of the microorganisms involved."
