    "summary": "In this context, pentane is identified as a volatile gas that can be detected in breath samples and is used as a biomarker for lipid peroxidation, which reflects oxidative stress. The levels of exhaled pentane are reported to increase during asthma exacerbations, indicating a direct relationship between pentane levels and lipid peroxidation associated with oxidative stress in respiratory conditions. This suggests that pentane can serve as an indicator of lipid peroxidation in various diseases, including asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis."
