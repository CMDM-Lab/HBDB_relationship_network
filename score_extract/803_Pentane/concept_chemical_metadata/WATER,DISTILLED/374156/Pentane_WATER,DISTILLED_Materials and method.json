    "summary": "In this context, pentane and distilled water are mentioned in relation to an experimental setup involving vermiculite and gas adsorption studies. Distilled water is used for moisture control in the bioreactor, while pentane is the volatile organic compound being adsorbed. Their relationship is indirect, as they serve different roles in the experimentâ€”pentane as the adsorbate and distilled water as a medium for maintaining moisture conditions."
