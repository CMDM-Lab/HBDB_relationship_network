    "summary": "In this context, pentane is identified as a short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon among other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by algae in response to varying ionic strengths. The study suggests that pentane, along with ethane, propane, and butane, is released as a by-product of the algae's metabolic processes, particularly when glycerol is less needed for osmotic regulation. This indicates that pentane is a specific example of an aliphatic hydrocarbon produced under certain environmental conditions."
