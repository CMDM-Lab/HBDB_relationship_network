    "summary": "In this context, pentane is utilized as a model hydrophobic volatile organic compound (VOC) in a mineral salt medium (MSM) that contains various minerals essential for microbial growth and degradation processes. The minerals listed, such as NaNO3, MgSO4, and CaSO4, provide necessary nutrients for the fungi involved in the degradation of pentane, indicating a supportive relationship where minerals facilitate the biological activity related to pentane degradation."
