    "summary": "In this context, pentane and isoprene are both discussed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by marine phytoplankton under varying salinity conditions. The flux rates of pentane are calculated in relation to salinity, while isoprene is mentioned as having similar measurement values. The relationship suggests that both compounds are involved in cellular processes related to osmoregulation, although specific interactions between them are not detailed."
