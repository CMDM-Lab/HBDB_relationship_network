    "summary": "In this context, pentane is analyzed in terms of its concentration and removal capacity in a bioreactor, while nitrogen is utilized as a carrier gas in the analytical methods for measuring pentane and CO2 concentrations. The relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the role of nitrogen in facilitating the detection of pentane rather than any direct chemical or biological interaction between the two substances."
