    "summary": "In this context, pentane and butane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced at approximately equal concentrations in a 0.5 M NaCl solution. Their production is part of a broader study on VOC generation by cultures under varying ionic strengths, indicating a shared metabolic pathway or environmental condition influencing their synthesis. However, the specific relationship between pentane and butane is not elaborated upon beyond their co-occurrence in the same experimental conditions."
