    "summary": "In this context, pentane and butane are both mentioned as short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons that are released as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by algae in response to extracellular ionic strength. The study indicates that the production of these VOCs is influenced by ionic strength, with greater production at lower ionic strengths. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as VOCs."
