    "summary": "In this context, pentane and methane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are treated in gas-phase biofilters, particularly using filamentous fungi as biocatalysts. The discussion highlights the challenges of mass transfer and biodegradation of hydrophobic VOCs, including pentane and methane, in biofiltration systems. However, the relationship between pentane and methane is not explicitly detailed beyond their shared categorization as VOCs addressed in similar treatment processes."
