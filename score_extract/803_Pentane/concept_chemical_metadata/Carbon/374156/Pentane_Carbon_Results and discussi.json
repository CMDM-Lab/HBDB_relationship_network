    "summary": "In this context, pentane is identified as a hydrophobic carbon source that is being biodegraded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a biofilter. The study highlights the role of aerial fungal biomass in enhancing the efficiency of pentane degradation, indicating a direct relationship between pentane as a carbon source and the microbial activity involved in its breakdown. The presence of hydrophobic proteins on fungal hyphae is also noted, which are triggered by the hydrophobic nature of pentane, further emphasizing the connection between pentane and carbon in the context of biodegradation."
