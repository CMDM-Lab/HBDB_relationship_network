    "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by algae in response to varying ionic strengths. The production of pentane, along with other short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons, is noted to be greater at lower ionic strengths, suggesting a relationship between environmental conditions and VOC release. However, the mention of pentane does not provide additional insights into its specific role or interactions beyond its classification as a VOC."
