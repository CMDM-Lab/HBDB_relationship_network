    "summary": "In this context, pentane is discussed in terms of its biodegradation in a biofilm system. The study highlights the behavior of n-pentane, indicating that its concentration in the biofilm decreases despite higher concentrations in the gas phase. This suggests that the presence of aerial biomass enhances the biodegradation process of n-pentane, affecting its availability to microorganisms. The relationship is focused on the environmental and biological interactions of pentane within the system."
