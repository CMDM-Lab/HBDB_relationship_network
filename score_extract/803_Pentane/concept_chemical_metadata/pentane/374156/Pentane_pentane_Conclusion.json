    "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as a hydrophobic volatile organic compound (VOC) whose removal efficiency (EC) is influenced by the configuration of a fungal biofilter (FB). The study highlights that the presence of aerial biomass enhances the transport surface area, leading to improved solubility and removal of n-pentane. The relationship emphasizes the role of pentane in the context of biofiltration and its environmental impact, particularly regarding health effects associated with mold growth and MVOCs."
