    "summary": "In this context, pentane is specifically referred to as n-pentane, which is the target compound for biodegradation by the filamentous fungus Fusarium solani. The study focuses on modeling the growth of mycelium and quantifying the contributions of both aerial and non-aerial fungal biomass in the biodegradation process of n-pentane. The relationship is clear as the research aims to understand how effectively this fungus can degrade n-pentane, highlighting its significance in bioremediation efforts."
