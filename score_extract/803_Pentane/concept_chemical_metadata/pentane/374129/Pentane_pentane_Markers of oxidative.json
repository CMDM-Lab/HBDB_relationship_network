    "summary": "In this context, pentane is mentioned as a volatile gas detected in the breath, used to measure lipid peroxidation and reflect oxidative stress. The text indicates that exhaled pentane levels increase during asthma exacerbations and decrease during recovery, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress in respiratory conditions. However, the relationship is primarily observational without detailed mechanistic insights."
