    "summary": "In this context, pentane and vermiculite are related through an experimental setup designed to assess the adsorption characteristics of n-pentane on vermiculite. The study aims to validate the assumption of negligible pentane adsorption by determining the adsorption isotherm, indicating a direct investigation of their interaction in a controlled environment. The results are crucial for understanding the behavior of pentane in relation to vermiculite's properties."
