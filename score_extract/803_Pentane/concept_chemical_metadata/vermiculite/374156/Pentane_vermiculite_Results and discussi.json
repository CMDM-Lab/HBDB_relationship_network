    "summary": "In this context, pentane and vermiculite are related through an adsorption experiment where n-pentane was tested for its interaction with vermiculite as an adsorbent at 30 °C. The study indicates that the maximum adsorption capacity of vermiculite for n-pentane is low (0.12 mg g−1), suggesting that the primary mechanism for n-pentane removal in the bioreactor is not adsorption but rather its metabolization by the aerial fungal biomass present. This highlights the limited role of vermiculite in the degradation process of n-pentane."
