    "summary": "In this context, pentane and propane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by cells grown in culture media with varying ionic strengths. The study highlights the production of these hydrocarbons in relation to the growth conditions, but does not provide specific details on their interaction or comparative significance. They are part of a broader analysis of VOCs generated under different conditions, indicating a general relationship as components of the same experimental setup."
