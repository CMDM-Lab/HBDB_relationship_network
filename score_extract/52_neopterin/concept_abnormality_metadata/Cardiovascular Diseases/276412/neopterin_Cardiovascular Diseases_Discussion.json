    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a significant biomarker associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Higher levels of neopterin correlate with increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and cardiac death. It serves as a prognostic indicator for cardiovascular events, reflecting the inflammatory processes within atherosclerotic lesions, where activated T-cells and macrophages contribute to neopterin production. This relationship underscores neopterin's role in risk stratification for patients with acute coronary syndromes, indicating its importance in cardiovascular pathology."
