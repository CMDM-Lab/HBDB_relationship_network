    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is associated with systemic inflammation linked to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), which is influenced by obesity. The study indicates that serum neopterin levels remain elevated despite adjustments for obesity measures, suggesting a potential role of neopterin as a marker for inflammation in obese patients with SDB. This relationship highlights the importance of neopterin in understanding the inflammatory processes that may be exacerbated by obesity."
