    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is linked to cardiovascular morbidity through its association with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and systemic inflammation. Elevated levels of neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation, may indicate increased risk for cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease. The study suggests that monitoring neopterin could help identify SDB patients at higher risk for future cardiovascular issues, highlighting its potential clinical significance in this area."
