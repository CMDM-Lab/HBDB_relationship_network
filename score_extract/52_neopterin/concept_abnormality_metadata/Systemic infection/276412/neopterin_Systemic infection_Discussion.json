    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a biomarker indicative of cell-mediated immunity, particularly in conditions characterized by T-helper type 1 lymphocyte activation. Elevated levels of neopterin are associated with systemic infections, among other pathologies. This suggests that neopterin can serve as a useful indicator for the presence and severity of systemic infections, linking it to broader systemic inflammation and related health risks."
