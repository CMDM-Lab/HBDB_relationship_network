    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is linked to atherosclerosis through its role in the inflammatory response within vascular plaques. Activated T-cells release interferon-Î³, stimulating macrophages to produce neopterin, which then enhances the expression of proinflammatory factors and adhesion molecules. This suggests that neopterin may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by promoting inflammation, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker in cardiovascular diseases."
