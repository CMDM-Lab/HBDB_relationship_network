    "summary": "In this context, neopterin levels are discussed in relation to central obesity, specifically waist circumference and BMI. The study indicates that higher neopterin levels are associated with increased measures of central obesity, suggesting a potential link between obesity and inflammatory processes reflected by neopterin. However, the study also notes that the association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) severity and neopterin levels remains significant even after adjusting for obesity metrics, indicating that while central obesity may influence neopterin levels, other factors may also play a role."
