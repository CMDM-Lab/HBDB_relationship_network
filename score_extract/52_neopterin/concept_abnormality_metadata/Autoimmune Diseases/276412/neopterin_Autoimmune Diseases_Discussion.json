    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a biochemical marker associated with cell-mediated immunity, particularly in pathological states involving T-helper type 1 lymphocyte activation. Elevated neopterin levels are noted in various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases, indicating its potential role in reflecting systemic inflammation and immune response in these disorders. The relationship suggests that neopterin could serve as a useful indicator for monitoring autoimmune diseases alongside other inflammatory markers."
