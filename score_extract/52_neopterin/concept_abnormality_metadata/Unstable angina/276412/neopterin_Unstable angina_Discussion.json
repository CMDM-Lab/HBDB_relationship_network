    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a significant biomarker associated with unstable angina and other cardiovascular conditions. Elevated levels of neopterin have been linked to an increased incidence of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. The study suggests that neopterin may provide better prognostic value than traditional markers like CRP, particularly in risk stratification for acute coronary syndromes, due to its correlation with T-cell and macrophage activation in atherosclerotic lesions."
