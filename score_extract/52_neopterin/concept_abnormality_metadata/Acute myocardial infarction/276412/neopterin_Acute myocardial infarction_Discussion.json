    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a significant biomarker associated with cell-mediated immunity and is linked to various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases. Elevated levels of neopterin have been correlated with an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction and other serious cardiac events, suggesting its potential utility in risk stratification for patients with acute coronary syndromes. The relationship is further supported by evidence indicating that neopterin levels may provide better predictive value for cardiovascular outcomes compared to traditional markers like CRP."
