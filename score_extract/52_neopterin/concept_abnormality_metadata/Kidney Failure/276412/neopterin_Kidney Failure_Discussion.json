    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a biomarker associated with various pathological states, including kidney failure. Elevated levels of neopterin indicate activation of T-helper type 1 lymphocytes and are linked to systemic inflammation, which is relevant in the context of renal failure. The relationship suggests that neopterin may serve as an important indicator for monitoring kidney health and associated inflammatory processes."
