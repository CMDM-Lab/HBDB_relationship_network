    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a significant biomarker associated with chronic stable angina and cardiovascular disease. Elevated neopterin levels have been linked to a higher incidence of adverse cardiac events, including myocardial infarction and unstable angina. The study suggests that neopterin may provide better prognostic value than traditional markers like CRP, indicating its role in assessing risk in patients with chronic stable angina and atherosclerotic lesions."
