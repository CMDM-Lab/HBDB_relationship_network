    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which is relevant to the formation of senile plaques in cardiovascular disease. Elevated neopterin levels indicate increased activation of T-cells and macrophages within atherosclerotic lesions, contributing to inflammation and plaque disruption. This suggests that neopterin may play a role in the development and progression of senile plaques through its involvement in inflammatory processes."
