    "summary": "In this context, neopterin is highlighted as a significant biomarker associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Elevated levels of neopterin have been linked to increased risk of nonfatal acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, suggesting its utility in risk stratification for patients with ACS. The relationship is further supported by evidence showing that neopterin levels correlate with complex coronary lesions and are influenced by activated T-cells and macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques, indicating its role in cardiovascular disease pathology."
