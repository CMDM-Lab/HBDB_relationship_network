    "summary": "In this context, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is linked to asthma through its role in the formation of protectin D1 (PD1), a mediator that counteracts inflammation in allergic airway conditions. The study indicates that PD1, derived from DHA, is present in lower levels in exhaled breath condensates of asthma patients during exacerbations, suggesting a potential protective role of DHA in managing asthma-related inflammation."
