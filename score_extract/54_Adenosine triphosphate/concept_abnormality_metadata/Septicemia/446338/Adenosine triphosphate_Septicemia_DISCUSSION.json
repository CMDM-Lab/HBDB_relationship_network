    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is indirectly related to septicemia through its role in mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism in lymphocytes. The study highlights that septic patients exhibit lower cellular ATP levels, which may contribute to impaired T cell function and increased susceptibility to infections and sepsis. This suggests that ATP levels are critical in understanding the immune response in septicemia."
