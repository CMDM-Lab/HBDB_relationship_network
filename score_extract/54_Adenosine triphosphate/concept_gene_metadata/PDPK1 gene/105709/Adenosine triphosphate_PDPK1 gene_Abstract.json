    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for the function of the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) gene, as PDK1 has an ATP-binding pocket essential for its kinase activity. PDK1 phosphorylates various AGC kinases, and its activity is directly influenced by ATP concentration, indicating a significant biochemical relationship between ATP and PDK1 in cellular signaling pathways."
