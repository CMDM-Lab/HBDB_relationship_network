    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to the PDK1 gene, which encodes the PDK1 enzyme. The study highlights the catalytic mechanism of PDK1, indicating that ATP binds to the enzyme without negative cooperativity, suggesting a direct functional relationship where ATP serves as a substrate for PDK1, essential for its kinase activity. This relationship is crucial for understanding PDK1's role in cellular signaling pathways."
