    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in T cell activation, which is essential for the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression. The release of ATP stimulates purinergic receptors that facilitate calcium influx necessary for IL-2 production and T cell effector functions. This indicates a direct relationship where ATP is vital for the activation of T cells, leading to IL-2 gene expression, highlighting the importance of ATP in immune responses."
