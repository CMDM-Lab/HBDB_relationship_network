    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T cell activation and the transcription of the IL-2 gene. The stimulation of T cells leads to a rapid increase in ATP levels, which is essential for various cellular processes, including the induction of IL-2 transcription. Inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production disrupts this process, indicating that ATP is a key regulator of IL-2 expression in T cells, linking energy metabolism to immune function."
