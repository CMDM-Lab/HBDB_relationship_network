    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial energy carrier that fuels purinergic signaling mechanisms essential for T cell activation. The PANX1 gene encodes pannexin-1 channels, which facilitate the release of ATP from T cells. This ATP release is vital for activating purinergic receptors that regulate T cell functions, indicating a direct relationship between ATP and the PANX1 gene in immune responses."
