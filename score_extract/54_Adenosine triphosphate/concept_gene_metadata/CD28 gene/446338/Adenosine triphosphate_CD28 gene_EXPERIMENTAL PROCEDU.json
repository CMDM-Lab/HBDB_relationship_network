    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is measured in Jurkat cells or CD4+ T cells that are stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated beads. The CD28 gene is crucial for T cell activation, and its stimulation is linked to increased ATP production, indicating a relationship between ATP levels and T cell activation through CD28 signaling. However, the context does not provide detailed insights into the specific mechanisms or quantitative relationships between ATP and the CD28 gene."
