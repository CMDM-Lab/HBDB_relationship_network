    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is assessed in Jurkat cells during immune synapse formation, particularly in relation to stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-coated beads. The CD28 gene product is crucial for T cell activation, and its engagement leads to ATP release, indicating a functional relationship where CD28 signaling influences ATP dynamics in immune responses. However, the specific role of the CD28 gene in ATP release is not deeply explored in the provided context."
