    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in T cell signaling, particularly in relation to the CD28 gene. ATP stimulates P2X receptors, facilitating calcium influx that amplifies T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 signaling. This interaction is essential for sustaining T cell function and preventing immunosuppression, highlighting the importance of ATP in modulating the effects of CD28 during immune responses."
