    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to the RHDV Î”2C polypeptide, which exhibits ATPase activity and binds ATP. The study investigates how specific conserved motifs within the polypeptide contribute to ATP binding and hydrolysis, indicating a direct functional relationship between ATP and the polypeptide's activity. The mutagenesis experiments aim to elucidate the role of certain amino acid residues in this process, highlighting the significance of polypeptides in ATP interactions."
