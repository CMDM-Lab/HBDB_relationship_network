    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a neurotransmitter involved in the modulation of enteric neurons, specifically influencing slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in submucosal secretomotor neurons via P2Y1 receptors. While adenosine mediates inhibitory effects, ATP acts as a neurotransmitter that can evoke excitatory responses, indicating a complex interplay between ATP and other neurotransmitters in the enteric nervous system (ENS). This relationship underscores the role of ATP in neurotransmission and its significance in neuronal signaling."
