    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is central to the energy metabolism of T cells, particularly during activation. Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) is used to inhibit mitochondrial ATP production, allowing researchers to assess the contribution of glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation to ATP levels. The results indicate that Jurkat cells primarily rely on glycolysis for ATP production, while CCCP affects ATP release during T cell stimulation, highlighting the interplay between ATP generation pathways in immune cell function."
