    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed as a signaling molecule released by cells, which can act as a ligand for purinergic receptors. The breakdown of ATP by ectonucleotidases produces metabolites like ADP, AMP, and adenosine, which also function as active ligands. The focus is primarily on ATP's role at P2 receptors, highlighting its significance in purinergic signaling."
