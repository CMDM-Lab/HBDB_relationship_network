    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to heavy ions through the stimulation of primary CD4+ T cells and Jurkat cells, which leads to intense mitochondrial activity and ATP production. The heavy ion flux is associated with ATP release across the mitochondrial membrane, indicating that heavy ions play a role in enhancing ATP synthesis during cellular stimulation. This relationship highlights the importance of ATP in cellular energy dynamics, particularly in response to heavy ion exposure."
