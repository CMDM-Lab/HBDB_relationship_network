    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to bicarbonates (HCO3âˆ’) through its role in stimulating secretion in the small intestine and colon. The activation of P2Y1 receptors by ATP leads to the secretion of water, chloride ions, and bicarbonates, indicating that ATP plays a crucial role in regulating mucosal secretion and fluid balance in the gastrointestinal tract. This suggests a direct functional relationship between ATP signaling and bicarbonate secretion."
