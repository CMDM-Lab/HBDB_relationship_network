    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed as a key signaling molecule in the nervous system, which is broken down into various metabolites, including anions such as ADP and AMP, through the action of ectonucleotidases. These anions play a role in purinergic signaling, influencing receptor activity and cellular responses. The relationship highlights ATP's function as a precursor to anionic metabolites that are crucial for neurotransmission and cellular communication."
