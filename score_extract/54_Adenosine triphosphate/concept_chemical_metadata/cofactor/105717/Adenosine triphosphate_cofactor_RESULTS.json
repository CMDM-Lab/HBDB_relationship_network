    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is described as a cofactor in the enzymatic reaction involving thymidine kinase (TK). The ternary complex formed by TK, dT, and ATP indicates that ATP plays a crucial role in the binding and catalytic process of the enzyme. The presence of ATP is essential for the phosphorylation reaction, highlighting its function as a necessary cofactor for the enzyme's activity."
