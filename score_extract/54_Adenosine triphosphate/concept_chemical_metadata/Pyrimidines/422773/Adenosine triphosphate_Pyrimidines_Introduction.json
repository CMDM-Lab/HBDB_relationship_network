    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed primarily in relation to its role as a neurotransmitter and its interactions with purinergic receptors. While pyrimidines are mentioned in the context of receptor characterization, there is no direct discussion of their relationship with ATP. Both terms are part of the broader purinergic signaling framework, but their specific interactions or functional connections are not elaborated upon."
