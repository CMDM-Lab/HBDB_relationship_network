    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule produced by mitochondria that plays a significant role in purinergic signaling mechanisms, which facilitate sustained calcium influx in immune cells. Additionally, reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated during ATP production, are described as secondary messengers necessary for T cell activation. This indicates a direct relationship where ATP and ROS function together in signaling pathways critical for immune responses."
