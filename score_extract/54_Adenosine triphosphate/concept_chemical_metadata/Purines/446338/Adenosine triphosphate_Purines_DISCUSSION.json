    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and purines are interconnected through the mechanisms of cellular energy production and metabolism during T cell activation. The rapid increase in ATP production is linked to purine salvage pathways, which recycle purines to generate adenosine diphosphate (ADP) that is subsequently phosphorylated to ATP in mitochondria. This highlights the critical role of purines in supporting ATP synthesis, particularly in immune responses."
