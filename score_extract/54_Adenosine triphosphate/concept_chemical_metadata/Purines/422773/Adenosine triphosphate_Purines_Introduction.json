    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as a key purine nucleotide involved in purinergic signaling within the nervous system. ATP functions as both a neurotransmitter and a cotransmitter, highlighting its critical role in the signaling pathways associated with purines. The breakdown of ATP into other purines like ADP and AMP further emphasizes its relationship with the purine family, as these metabolites are integral to various physiological processes."
