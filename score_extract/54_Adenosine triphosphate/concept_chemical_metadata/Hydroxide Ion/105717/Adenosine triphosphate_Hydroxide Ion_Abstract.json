    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is involved in the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by thymidine kinase, where it donates a phosphate group. Hydroxide ions (OH-) are not directly mentioned in relation to ATP or the enzymatic activity described. While hydroxide ions can influence pH and enzyme activity, their specific role in the phosphorylation process involving ATP and thymidine kinase is not detailed, indicating a lack of direct interaction."
