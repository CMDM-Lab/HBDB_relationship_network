    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed as a substrate involved in the enzymatic activity of HSV1 TK, where the triphosphate group is a critical component of ATP. The presence of the triphosphate moiety is essential for the phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme, indicating a direct functional relationship between ATP and its triphosphate structure in biochemical processes."
