    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is analyzed in relation to its intracellular concentrations, which are assessed after cells are snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The use of liquid nitrogen is crucial for preserving the cellular state and preventing degradation of ATP during the analysis process. Thus, while ATP and liquid nitrogen are not directly related in function, liquid nitrogen plays a vital role in the preservation and accurate measurement of ATP levels in the study."
