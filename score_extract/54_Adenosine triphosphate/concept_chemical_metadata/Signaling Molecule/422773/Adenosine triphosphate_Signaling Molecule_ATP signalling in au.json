    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as a crucial signaling molecule involved in purinergic signaling within the autonomic nervous system. ATP plays a significant role in neuroeffector transmission across various systems, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal functions. It is recognized as a principal neurotransmitter in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves, highlighting its importance in mediating communication between neurons and target tissues."
