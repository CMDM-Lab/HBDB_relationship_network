    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its physiological release from cells and subsequent breakdown by ectonucleotidases into metabolites such as ADP, AMP, and adenosine. These metabolites play a role in purinergic signaling, indicating that ATP and its metabolites are interconnected in cellular communication and function. The focus is primarily on ATP's role at P2 receptors, while the metabolites' effects are acknowledged but not elaborated upon."
