    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding and conformational changes in the enzyme HSV1 TK, which is involved in nucleotide metabolism. However, sulfuric acid esters are not mentioned in a relevant context or linked to ATP's function or metabolism. Therefore, there is no direct relationship between ATP and sulfuric acid esters in this discussion."
