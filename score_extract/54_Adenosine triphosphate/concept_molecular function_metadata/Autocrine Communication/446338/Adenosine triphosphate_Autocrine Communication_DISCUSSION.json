    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in autocrine communication by stimulating P2X receptors, which are ATP-gated Ca2+ channels. This interaction facilitates Ca2+ influx and enhances T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 signaling, thereby sustaining autocrine purinergic signaling. The feedback loops involving ATP production and Ca2+ signaling are essential for T cell function, indicating a direct and significant relationship between ATP and autocrine communication in immune responses."
