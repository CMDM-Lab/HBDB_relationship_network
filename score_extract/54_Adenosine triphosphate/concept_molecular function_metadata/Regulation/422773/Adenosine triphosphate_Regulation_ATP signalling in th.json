    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, particularly in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and central nervous system (CNS). ATP mediates excitatory purinergic signaling that influences mucosal secretion and neurohormone release, indicating its role in the regulation of autonomic functions such as breathing and body temperature control. The evidence suggests that ATP is integral to the regulatory mechanisms governing these physiological responses."
