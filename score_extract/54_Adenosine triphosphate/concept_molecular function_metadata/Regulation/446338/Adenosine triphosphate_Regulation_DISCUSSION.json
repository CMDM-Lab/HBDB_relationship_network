    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T cell activation, as its production is linked to autocrine purinergic signaling processes that regulate calcium influx and support T cell proliferation. The regulation of ATP production and its signaling effects are essential for maintaining cytosolic calcium homeostasis, which is vital for T cell responses. Thus, ATP plays a significant role in the regulatory mechanisms that enhance T cell activation and function."
