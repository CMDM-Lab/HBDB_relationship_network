    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding properties, specifically highlighting the heat capacity change (Î”Cp) associated with ATP binding. The study indicates that ATP binding involves significant conformational changes in the enzyme's active site, suggesting that ATP binding is a dynamic process influenced by the structural adaptations of the enzyme. This relationship emphasizes the importance of ATP in enzymatic activity and molecular recognition during biochemical reactions."
