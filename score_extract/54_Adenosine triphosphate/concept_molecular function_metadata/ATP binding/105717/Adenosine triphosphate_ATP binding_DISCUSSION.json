    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding properties, specifically contributing to a significant negative heat capacity change during association processes with proteins. The text indicates that ATP binding plays a role in the thermodynamic parameters of the reaction, highlighting its importance in biochemical interactions. This suggests a direct relationship between ATP and its binding characteristics in the context of protein interactions."
