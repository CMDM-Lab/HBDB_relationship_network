    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly related to ATP binding through its role as a substrate for the viral thymidine kinase (HSV1 TK). The binding of thymidine to HSV1 TK is a prerequisite for ATP binding, indicating that the conformational changes in the enzyme upon substrate binding facilitate the proper orientation of ATP for catalysis. This highlights a critical interaction where ATP binding is contingent upon the prior binding of thymidine, demonstrating a significant relationship between the two terms in the context of enzyme activity."
