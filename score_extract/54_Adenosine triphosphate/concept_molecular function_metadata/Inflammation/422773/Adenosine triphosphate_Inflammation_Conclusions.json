    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is implicated in the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) autonomic circuits, particularly during systemic inflammation. The report indicates that extracellular ATP levels in the brain increase during inflammation, suggesting that purinergic signaling may play a role in the autonomic control mechanisms affected by inflammatory states. This highlights a significant relationship between ATP and inflammation, as ATP's actions could influence both central and peripheral responses to inflammatory challenges."
