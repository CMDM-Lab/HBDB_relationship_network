    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is closely related to the synthesis processes involved in T cell activation. The study highlights that ATP production during this activation is not solely dependent on the phosphorylation of adenine precursors but also involves additional mechanisms such as nucleoside scavenging and de novo synthesis pathways. This indicates that the synthesis of ATP is a complex process that is crucial for the rapid energy demands of activated T cells."
