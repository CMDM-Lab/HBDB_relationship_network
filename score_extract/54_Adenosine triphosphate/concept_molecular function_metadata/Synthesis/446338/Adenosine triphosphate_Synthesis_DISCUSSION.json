    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to the synthesis processes involved in T cell activation. The rapid increase in ATP production during this activation requires mechanisms that provide adenosine diphosphate (ADP) for phosphorylation to ATP in mitochondria. The discussion includes the potential roles of purine salvage pathways and de novo purine synthesis in ATP synthesis, highlighting the importance of these pathways in immune function and cellular energy metabolism."
