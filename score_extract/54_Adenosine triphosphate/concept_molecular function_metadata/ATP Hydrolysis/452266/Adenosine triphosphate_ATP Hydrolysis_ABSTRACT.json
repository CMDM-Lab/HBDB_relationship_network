    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly related to ATP hydrolysis, as the text discusses the effects of mutations on ATP hydrolysis and ATP-binding capacities in RNA helicases. The hydrolysis of ATP is a critical biochemical process that provides energy for various cellular functions, and the study highlights how specific mutations can abolish ATPase activity, indicating a strong functional relationship between ATP and its hydrolysis."
