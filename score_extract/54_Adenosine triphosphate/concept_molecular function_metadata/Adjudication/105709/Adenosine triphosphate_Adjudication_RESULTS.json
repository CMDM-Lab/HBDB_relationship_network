    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its role as a substrate in kinase reactions involving PDK1, where its Km value is determined. However, the term 'adjudication' is not mentioned in a relevant context, nor is there any discussion linking ATP to adjudication. Thus, there is no meaningful relationship between the two terms in this context."
