    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is mentioned in relation to its quantification during calorimetric experiments and chromatography methods. However, there is no mention or discussion of 'adjudication' in a biological or chemical context, making it unclear how these two terms relate to each other. The terms appear in the same document but do not interact or connect meaningfully."
