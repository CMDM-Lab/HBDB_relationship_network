    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule that modulates various physiological actions within the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in autonomic control. ATP influences the activities of neural networks related to vagal, presympathetic, and respiratory functions, especially during challenges like systemic hypoxia. The modulation of these physiological actions by ATP is significant, although the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The role of ATP in both normal and pathological states underscores its importance in regulating autonomic functions across multiple systems."
