    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is involved in the binding process of an enzyme, which undergoes significant conformational changes during substrate binding. The large heat capacity changes (Î”Cp) associated with ATP binding suggest that macromolecular alterations occur as the enzyme transitions from a more open conformation to a closed state upon substrate binding. This indicates a direct relationship between ATP binding and macromolecular alteration, highlighting the dynamic nature of enzyme-substrate interactions."
