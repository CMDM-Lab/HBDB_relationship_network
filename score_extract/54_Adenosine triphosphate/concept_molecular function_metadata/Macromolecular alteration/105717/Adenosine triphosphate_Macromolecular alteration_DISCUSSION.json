    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is discussed in relation to its binding with HSV1 TK and dT, where the changes in heat capacity (Î”Cp) are calculated based on the surface area buried during the complex formation. While ATP is a substrate involved in the binding process, the term 'macromolecular alteration' refers to the structural changes in proteins upon binding. The relationship suggests that ATP's interaction with macromolecules like proteins can lead to alterations in their structural and thermodynamic properties, although specific details on the nature of these alterations are not provided."
