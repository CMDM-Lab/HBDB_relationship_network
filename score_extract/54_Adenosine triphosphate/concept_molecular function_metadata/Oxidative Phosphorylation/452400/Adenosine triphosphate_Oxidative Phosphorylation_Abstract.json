    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly linked to oxidative phosphorylation, which is the process by which ATP is produced in mitochondria during aerobic respiration. The text discusses how ATP supply is affected under hypoxic conditions, emphasizing the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in maintaining ATP levels even when oxygen is limited. The efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is highlighted, showing its critical role in ATP synthesis and bioenergetic efficiency, particularly under varying oxygen levels."
