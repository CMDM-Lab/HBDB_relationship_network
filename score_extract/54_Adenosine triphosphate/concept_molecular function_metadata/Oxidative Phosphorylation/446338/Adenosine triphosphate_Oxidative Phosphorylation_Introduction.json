    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as the primary energy carrier essential for various cellular processes, including T cell activation. The production of ATP is linked to oxidative phosphorylation, which is part of the metabolic pathways that quiescent T cells utilize for energy. Although T cell stimulation shifts metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation remains a critical source of ATP, suggesting a significant relationship between ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation in supporting T cell functions."
