    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced rapidly in response to T cell stimulation, which is closely linked to oxidative phosphorylation. The findings indicate that mitochondrial activation leads to bursts of ATP release, highlighting the critical role of oxidative phosphorylation in generating ATP during cellular activation. This relationship underscores the importance of mitochondrial function in energy production within immune cells."
