    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial energy carrier that underpins various cellular processes, particularly in T cell physiology. The release of ATP through pannexin-1 channels and its interaction with purinergic receptors are essential for T cell activation, influencing calcium influx and interleukin-2 production. Furthermore, ATP production in T cells shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis upon stimulation, emphasizing its central role in meeting the energetic demands of rapidly dividing cells."
