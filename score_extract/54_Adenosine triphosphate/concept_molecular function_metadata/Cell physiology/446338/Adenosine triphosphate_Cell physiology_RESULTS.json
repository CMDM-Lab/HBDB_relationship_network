    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial energy molecule necessary for T cell function and activation. The study indicates that mitochondrial ATP production and ATP release via panx1 channels are essential for effective T cell responses, linking ATP directly to cell physiology and immune function. This underscores the importance of ATP in maintaining cellular processes and signaling pathways critical for immune defense."
