    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a key signaling molecule that interacts with purinergic nucleotide receptors, specifically P2 receptors, in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia. The simultaneous release of ATP and acetylcholine (ACh) suggests a functional role for ATP in neurotransmission. The study indicates that ATP can mimic excitatory synaptic potentials, demonstrating its significant role in receptor activity and signaling pathways within the nervous system."
