    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as a key transmitter in sympathetic nerve activity, particularly in relation to purinergic nucleotide receptor activity. ATP activates presynaptic ionotropic P2X receptors, facilitating sympathetic transmission, while also influencing the release of other neurotransmitters. This highlights a direct and significant relationship between ATP and purinergic receptor activity, particularly in the modulation of sympathetic nerve functions."
