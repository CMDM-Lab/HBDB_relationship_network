    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is closely linked to the electron transport chain (ETC) as both are integral to mitochondrial function. Enhanced activity in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle energizes the ETC, leading to increased ATP production. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as byproducts of ATP synthesis further indicates the active role of the ETC in cellular energy metabolism, particularly in stimulated T cells."
