    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is assessed for its role during synapse formation, indicating its involvement in synaptogenesis. The study measures ATP release during the formation of cell aggregates, suggesting that ATP may play a critical role in the signaling processes that facilitate synaptic connections. The methods employed, including fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry, highlight the importance of ATP in cellular interactions relevant to synaptogenesis."
