    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to the process of polymerization through the action of latrunculin B, which inhibits actin polymerization and subsequently reduces ATP release from stimulated cells. This indicates that actin polymerization is crucial for ATP dynamics during T cell activation, suggesting a significant relationship between ATP levels and the polymerization of actin in cellular processes."
