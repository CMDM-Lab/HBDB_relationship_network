    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T cell activation and function, influencing the transcription of IL-2, a key cytokine in immune responses. The study highlights that ATP production is essential for purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate T cell activity, linking ATP levels directly to genetic transcription processes involved in immune responses. The inhibition of ATP production disrupts transcriptional activation, demonstrating a clear relationship between ATP and genetic transcription in T cells."
