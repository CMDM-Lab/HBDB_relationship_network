    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule involved in sensory transduction, particularly in response to physiological stimuli. ATP is released by sensory neurons in reaction to various stimuli, activating P2X and P2Y receptors that mediate sensory modalities such as nociception and chemosensitivity. This indicates a direct relationship where ATP acts as a mediator for sensory responses to stimuli."
