    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is described as a co-released neurotransmitter alongside acetylcholine (ACh) in the myenteric plexus, where it acts on P2Y1 receptors to evoke slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). The term 'stimulus' refers to the sympathetic release of ATP, which activates these receptors, leading to excitatory effects on secretomotor neurons. This indicates that ATP plays a crucial role in mediating responses to stimuli in the enteric nervous system, particularly in regulating mucosal secretion."
