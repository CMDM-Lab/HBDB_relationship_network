    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is described as a key signaling molecule that can be released from cells in response to various stimuli. It acts as a cotransmitter in the nervous system, influencing neuronal communication. The release of ATP can be triggered by physiological stimuli, highlighting its role in purinergic signaling and cellular responses to environmental changes."
