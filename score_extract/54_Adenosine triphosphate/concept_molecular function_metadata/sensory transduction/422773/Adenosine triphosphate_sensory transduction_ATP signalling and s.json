    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in sensory transduction by acting on P2X and P2Y receptors expressed in sensory neurons. The release of ATP in response to physiological stimuli activates these receptors, facilitating the transmission of sensory signals. The study highlights the importance of ATP-mediated signaling in sensory neurons, particularly in the context of understanding how sensory information is processed and relayed in the nervous system."
