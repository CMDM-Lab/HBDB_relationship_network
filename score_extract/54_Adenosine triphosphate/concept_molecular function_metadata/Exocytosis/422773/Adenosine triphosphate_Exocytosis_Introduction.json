    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a key molecule involved in neurotransmission, where it can act as a transmitter or cotransmitter in the nervous system. The release of ATP is facilitated through mechanisms such as vesicular exocytosis, indicating a direct relationship between ATP and the process of exocytosis, which is crucial for the secretion of neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. This underscores the importance of ATP in cellular communication and signaling pathways."
