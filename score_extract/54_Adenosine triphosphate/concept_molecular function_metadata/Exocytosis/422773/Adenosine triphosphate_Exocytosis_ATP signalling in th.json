    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule that activates P2Y1 receptors on secretomotor neurons, leading to excitatory responses. This activation suggests that ATP plays a significant role in stimulating exocytosis of neurohormones and secretion of electrolytes in the gastrointestinal tract, indicating its importance in the regulation of mucosal secretion and autonomic functions."
