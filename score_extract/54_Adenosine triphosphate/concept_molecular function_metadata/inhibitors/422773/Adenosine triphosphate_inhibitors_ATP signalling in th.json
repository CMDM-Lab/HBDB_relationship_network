    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule in purinergic signaling, which modulates neuronal activity, including excitatory and inhibitory inputs to cardiac vagal preganglionic motoneurons. While the term 'inhibitors' is mentioned, the specific relationship between ATP and inhibitors is not explicitly detailed, suggesting that inhibitors may affect ATP's signaling role indirectly rather than through a direct interaction."
