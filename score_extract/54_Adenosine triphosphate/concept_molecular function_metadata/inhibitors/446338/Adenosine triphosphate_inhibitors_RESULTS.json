    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for sustaining Ca2+ signaling in stimulated T cells, as indicated by the effects of various inhibitors. The inhibition of mitochondrial ATP production with CCCP and ATP release with the panx1 inhibitor CBX both blocked sustained Ca2+ signaling, highlighting the essential role of ATP in T cell activation. Additionally, the inhibition of P2 receptors with suramin further disrupted Ca2+ signaling, suggesting that ATP and purinergic signaling are interconnected in this process."
