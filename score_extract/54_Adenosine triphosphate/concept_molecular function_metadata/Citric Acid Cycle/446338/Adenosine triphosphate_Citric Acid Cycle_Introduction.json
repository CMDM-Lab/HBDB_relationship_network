    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is identified as the primary energy carrier essential for various cellular processes, including T cell activation. The production of ATP in quiescent T cells is linked to the metabolism of glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, which relies on the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation. The context highlights the metabolic switch that occurs during T cell stimulation, emphasizing the importance of the TCA cycle in ATP production, particularly in supporting the energetic demands of rapidly dividing T cells."
