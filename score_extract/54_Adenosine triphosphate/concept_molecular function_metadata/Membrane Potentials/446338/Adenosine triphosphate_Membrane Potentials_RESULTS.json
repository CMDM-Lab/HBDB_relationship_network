    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production is closely linked to membrane potentials, particularly the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). The maintenance of Δψm is crucial for oxidative phosphorylation, which drives ATP synthesis in mitochondria. The study highlights how T cell activation influences Δψm, thereby affecting ATP release and cellular energy dynamics during immune responses."
