    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a critical energy molecule whose production is influenced by oxygen levels, particularly under hypoxic conditions. The study emphasizes that even low oxygen levels can support mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation, which is vital for cellular survival during severe hypoxia, such as in high altitudes or ischemic states. This underscores the relationship between ATP production and the physiological responses to hypoxia."
