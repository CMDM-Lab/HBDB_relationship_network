    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule involved in purinergic signaling, particularly in the recovery from hypoxia. ATP is suggested to enhance excitatory glutamatergic input to cardiac vagal preganglionic motoneurons during hypoxic recovery, indicating its role in modulating autonomic responses to low oxygen levels. This relationship underscores ATP's importance as both an energy source and a signaling molecule in physiological processes related to hypoxia."
