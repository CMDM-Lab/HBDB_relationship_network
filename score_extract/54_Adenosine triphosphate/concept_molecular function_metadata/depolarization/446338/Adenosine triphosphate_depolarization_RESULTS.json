    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production is closely linked to depolarization events in both T cells and neurons. The stimulation of T cells leads to mitochondrial depolarization, which is associated with increased ATP production due to heightened mitochondrial activity. This relationship highlights the role of ATP in supporting cellular functions during depolarization, particularly in response to stimulation."
