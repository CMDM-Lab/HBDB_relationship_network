    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T cell activation through purinergic signaling mechanisms. The release of ATP via pannexin-1 channels initiates autocrine feedback through purinergic receptors, which is essential for T cell function and the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2). This feedback mechanism highlights the role of ATP not only as an energy carrier but also as a signaling molecule that regulates immune responses."
