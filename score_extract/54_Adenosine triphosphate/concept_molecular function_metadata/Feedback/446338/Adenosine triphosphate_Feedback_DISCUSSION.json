    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in feedback mechanisms at the immune synapse. Following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, ATP is produced and released, which activates P2X receptors, facilitating calcium influx. This creates feedback loops that enhance mitochondrial ATP production and sustain signaling pathways, thereby amplifying TCR/CD28 signaling. The interplay between ATP and feedback mechanisms is essential for maintaining T cell function and preventing immunosuppression."
