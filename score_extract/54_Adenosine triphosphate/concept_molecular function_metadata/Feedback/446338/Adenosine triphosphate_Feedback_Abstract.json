    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T cell function, as its release and subsequent autocrine feedback through purinergic receptors regulate T cell activity. The stimulation of T cells leads to a rapid increase in ATP production, which is essential for various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and immune response. This indicates a direct relationship where ATP acts as a signaling molecule that influences feedback mechanisms in T cell activation."
