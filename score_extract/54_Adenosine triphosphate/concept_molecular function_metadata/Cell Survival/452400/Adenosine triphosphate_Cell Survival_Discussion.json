    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a critical energy molecule that supports cellular survival, particularly under conditions of low oxygen availability. The study emphasizes that efficient oxidative phosphorylation, which produces ATP, is vital for maintaining cell viability during hypoxic conditions. This suggests a direct relationship between ATP production and cell survival, especially in challenging environments such as high altitudes or ischemic states."
