    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for the phosphorylation of myosin, which affects muscle contraction dynamics. The phosphorylation state of myosin is linked to ATP consumption and influences the cross-bridge cycling rate, thereby impacting force generation and muscle performance. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding these interactions to accurately model muscle mechanics."
