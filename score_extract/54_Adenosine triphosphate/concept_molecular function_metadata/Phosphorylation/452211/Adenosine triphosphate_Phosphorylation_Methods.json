    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly involved in the phosphorylation processes of myosin and actomyosin complexes during muscle contraction. The phosphorylation of these proteins is crucial for muscle function, as it regulates the interaction between actin and myosin, thereby influencing force development. The rate of ATP consumption is linked to these phosphorylation events, indicating a significant relationship between ATP and phosphorylation in muscle physiology."
