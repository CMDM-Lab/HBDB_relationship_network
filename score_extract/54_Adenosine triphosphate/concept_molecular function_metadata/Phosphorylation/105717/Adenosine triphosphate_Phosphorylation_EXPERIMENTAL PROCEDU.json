    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is mentioned as a key molecule involved in phosphorylation processes, which are critical for various biochemical reactions. The study utilizes high-performance liquid chromatography to monitor potential phosphorylation products, indicating that ATP serves as a substrate for phosphorylation reactions. This highlights the direct role of ATP in energy transfer and metabolic regulation through phosphorylation."
