    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly involved in the phosphorylation process catalyzed by thymidine kinase, which transfers the Î³-phosphate group of ATP to the 5'-OH group of thymidine, converting it to dTMP. This highlights ATP's critical role as a phosphate donor in phosphorylation reactions, particularly in the context of viral enzyme activity."
