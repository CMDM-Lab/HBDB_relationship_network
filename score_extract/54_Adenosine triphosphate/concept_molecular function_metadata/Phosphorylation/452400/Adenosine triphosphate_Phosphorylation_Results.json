    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly linked to the process of phosphorylation, which refers to the conversion of ADP to ATP during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. The study quantifies the efficiency of ATP synthesis per unit of oxygen consumed, highlighting the critical role of phosphorylation in energy metabolism. The calculated ADP/O flux ratio indicates the extent of ATP production, demonstrating a clear and significant relationship between ATP and phosphorylation in cellular respiration."
