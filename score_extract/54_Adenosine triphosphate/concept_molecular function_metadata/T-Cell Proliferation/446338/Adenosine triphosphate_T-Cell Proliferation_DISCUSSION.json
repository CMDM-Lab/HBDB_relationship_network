    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T-cell proliferation, as it fuels autocrine purinergic signaling that enhances calcium influx and supports intracellular processes necessary for T-cell activation. The study highlights the role of ATP production in conjunction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) in promoting T-cell responses, indicating a direct relationship between ATP levels and T-cell proliferation mechanisms."
