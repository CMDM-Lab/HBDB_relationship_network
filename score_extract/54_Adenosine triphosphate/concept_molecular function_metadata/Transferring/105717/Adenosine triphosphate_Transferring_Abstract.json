    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is involved in the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by thymidine kinase, where it transfers its Î³-phosphate group to thymidine, converting it to dTMP. This highlights ATP's role as a phosphate donor in biochemical reactions, specifically in the phosphorylation process, which is crucial for nucleotide metabolism and viral replication."
