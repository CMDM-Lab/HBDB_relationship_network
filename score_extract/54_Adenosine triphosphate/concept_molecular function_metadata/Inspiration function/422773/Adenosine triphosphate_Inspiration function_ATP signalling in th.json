    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of brainstem networks responsible for respiratory function. ATP influences the medullary respiratory rhythm-generating network, facilitating adaptive changes in breathing patterns in response to variations in inspired CO2 and O2 levels. The release of ATP in the medulla is linked to maintaining respiratory activity during hypoxia, highlighting its significance in the inspiration function."
