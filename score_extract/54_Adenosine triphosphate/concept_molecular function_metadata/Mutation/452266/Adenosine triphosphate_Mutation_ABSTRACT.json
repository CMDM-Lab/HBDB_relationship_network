    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is critically linked to mutations in the poliovirus 2C protein, where specific mutations impair ATP-binding and ATPase activities, leading to lethal consequences for viral RNA replication. The study highlights how mutations in conserved residues affect ATP's functional role in RNA helicase activity, emphasizing the importance of ATP in the biological processes influenced by these mutations."
