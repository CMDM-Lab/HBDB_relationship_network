    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and entropy are discussed in relation to the thermodynamic parameters of binding reactions. The binding of dT to the enzyme is associated with a significant enthalpy change but incurs a high cost in entropy, indicating that the formation of the ATP binding site is thermodynamically driven by enthalpic factors while being constrained by entropic considerations. This highlights the interplay between ATP binding and entropy in biochemical reactions."
