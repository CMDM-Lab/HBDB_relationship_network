    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is implicated in neurotransmission within autonomic ganglia, particularly in the generation of excitatory synaptic potentials. ATP is released alongside acetylcholine (ACh) and acts on P2 receptors, influencing synaptic activity. The studies indicate that ATP can mimic excitatory synaptic potentials, highlighting its critical role in modulating synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia."
