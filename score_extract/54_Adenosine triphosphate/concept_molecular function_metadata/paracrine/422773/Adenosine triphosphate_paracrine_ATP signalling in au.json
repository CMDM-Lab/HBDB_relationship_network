    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is described as a key neurotransmitter released by inhibitory motoneurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS). It acts in a paracrine manner, meaning ATP can influence nearby non-excitable cells that express purinoceptors, facilitating local signaling and modulation of gut functions. This highlights the role of ATP not only as a neurotransmitter but also as a signaling molecule that operates through paracrine mechanisms to affect adjacent cells."
