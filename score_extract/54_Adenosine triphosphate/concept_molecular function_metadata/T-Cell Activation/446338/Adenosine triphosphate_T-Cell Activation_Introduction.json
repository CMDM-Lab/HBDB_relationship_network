    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial component in T cell activation. Mitochondria are shown to produce ATP, which is released from stimulated T cells to fuel purinergic signaling mechanisms at the immune synapse. This ATP production is essential for regulating calcium homeostasis and modulating signaling pathways that are critical for effective T cell activation and immune response."
