    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T-cell activation, as it is produced in a spike that fuels autocrine purinergic signaling processes. This signaling enhances Ca2+ influx and supports intracellular processes necessary for T-cell proliferation. Mitochondria play multiple roles in T-cell activation, including ATP generation, ROS production, and Ca2+ homeostasis regulation, indicating a direct and significant relationship between ATP and T-cell activation."
