    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial component for T-cell activation and function. The study indicates that mitochondrial ATP production and its release through panx1 channels are essential for proper T-cell activation and effector functions. The absence of these mechanisms leads to impaired T-cell responses, emphasizing the critical role of ATP in immune defense."
