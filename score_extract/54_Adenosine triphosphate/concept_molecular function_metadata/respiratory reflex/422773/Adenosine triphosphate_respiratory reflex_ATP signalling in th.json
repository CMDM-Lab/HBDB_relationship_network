    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is implicated in the neurotransmission of the pulmonary stretch receptor reflex, which is a critical component of the respiratory reflex. ATP signaling is shown to mediate the sympathoexcitatory response during chemoreceptor stimulation, influencing the duration of inspiration and integrating cardiovascular and respiratory information within the brainstem networks. This highlights ATP's essential role in the respiratory reflex pathway, particularly in response to lung inflation."
