    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced by mitochondria and plays a crucial role in autocrine purinergic signaling at the immunological synapse (IS). Mitochondria not only generate ATP but also regulate calcium signaling, which is essential for T cell activation. The positioning of mitochondria at the IS, influenced by the mitochondrial fission factor DRP-1, enhances ATP production and supports sustained signaling necessary for immune responses. This highlights the integral relationship between ATP production and mitochondrial function in cellular signaling and division processes."
