    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production is evaluated under conditions of anoxia, where oxygen supply is limited to 20-30% of the minimum aerobic rate. The study investigates mitochondrial respiration and phosphorylation rates in anoxic mitochondria, highlighting the challenges of ATP synthesis when oxygen levels are critically low. This relationship underscores the importance of oxygen in ATP generation and the metabolic adaptations of mitochondria in low-oxygen environments."
