    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is implicated in various physiological processes, particularly in purinergic signaling related to autonomic control of bodily functions. The report highlights ATP's role in influencing cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital systems during systemic inflammation. Additionally, the kinetics of ATP binding to heavy meromyosin (HMM) illustrates its involvement in calcium-dependent processes, emphasizing ATP's critical role in cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways."
