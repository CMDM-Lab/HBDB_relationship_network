    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is central to various metabolic processes, particularly in T cell activation. The study discusses how ATP is produced through distinct pathways, including glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The rapid release of ATP during T cell stimulation is linked to these metabolic processes, highlighting their critical role in cellular energy dynamics and function."
