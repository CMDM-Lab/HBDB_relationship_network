    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for the process of purinergic signaling amplification in T cells. The study highlights how T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation leads to increased mitochondrial ATP production, which is essential for the accumulation of ATP at the immunological synapse (IS). This ATP release facilitates calcium influx through P2X receptors, thereby enhancing TCR signaling. The relationship between ATP and the signaling process is integral, as ATP acts as a signaling molecule that modulates T cell responses."
