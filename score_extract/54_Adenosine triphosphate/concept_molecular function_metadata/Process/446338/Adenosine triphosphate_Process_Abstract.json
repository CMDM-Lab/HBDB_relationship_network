    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for the process of T cell activation and function. The study highlights that stimulation of T cells leads to a rapid increase in ATP production, which is essential for various cellular processes, including calcium signaling and the transcription of activation markers. The relationship is significant as ATP serves as a key energy source driving these processes, indicating its central role in T cell biology."
