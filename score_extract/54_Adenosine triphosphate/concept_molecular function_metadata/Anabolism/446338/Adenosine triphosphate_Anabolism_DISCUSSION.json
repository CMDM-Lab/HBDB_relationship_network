    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is crucial for T cell activation, providing the energy necessary for various cellular processes, including anabolism. Mitochondria produce ATP, which supports purinergic signaling and calcium homeostasis, while also shifting their role to generate TCA intermediates essential for biosynthesis during T cell activation. This indicates a direct relationship between ATP production and anabolic processes in activated T cells."
