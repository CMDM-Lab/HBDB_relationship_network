    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule involved in purinergic signaling within the autonomic nervous system. It plays a significant role in signal transduction processes, facilitating communication between neurons and their targets, particularly in neuroeffector transmission across various systems, including respiratory and gastrointestinal. The evidence suggests that ATP functions as a neurotransmitter, underscoring its importance in the signaling pathways that govern autonomic functions."
