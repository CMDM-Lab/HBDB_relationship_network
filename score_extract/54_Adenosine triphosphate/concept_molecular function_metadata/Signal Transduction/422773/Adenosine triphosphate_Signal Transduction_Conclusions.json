    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule involved in signal transduction, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS) during systemic challenges like hypoxia. ATP's role includes direct effects on neurons and indirect effects through glial networks and vascular responses. The modulation of purinergic signaling, which involves ATP, is suggested to influence autonomic control mechanisms in various physiological and pathological states, indicating a significant relationship between ATP and signal transduction pathways."
