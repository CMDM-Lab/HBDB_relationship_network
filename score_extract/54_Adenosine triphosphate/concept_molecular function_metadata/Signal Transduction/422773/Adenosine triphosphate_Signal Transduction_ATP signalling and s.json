    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction, particularly in the functioning of P2 receptors in parasympathetic and sensory neurons. ATP acts as a signaling molecule that activates various P2X and P2Y receptors, which are involved in sensory transduction by responding to changes in local ATP concentrations during physiological and pathological stimuli. The expression and functional roles of these receptors highlight the importance of ATP in mediating cellular communication and responses in the nervous system."
