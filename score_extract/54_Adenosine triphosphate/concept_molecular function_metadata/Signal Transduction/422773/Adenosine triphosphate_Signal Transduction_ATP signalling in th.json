    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial signaling molecule involved in purinergic signaling, particularly in the enteric nervous system (ENS). ATP acts as a neurotransmitter, influencing synaptic transmission and modulating various physiological responses, including peristalsis and nociception. The relationship between ATP and signal transduction is evident as ATP activates P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes, facilitating communication between neurons and contributing to the overall signaling processes in the gut."
