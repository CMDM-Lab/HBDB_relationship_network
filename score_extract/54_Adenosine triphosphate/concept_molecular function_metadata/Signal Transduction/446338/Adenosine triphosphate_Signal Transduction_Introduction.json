    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule produced by mitochondria during T cell activation. ATP is released from stimulated T cells to fuel purinergic signaling mechanisms, which are essential for regulating signal transduction pathways at the immune synapse. This indicates a direct role of ATP in modulating the signaling processes that govern T cell activation and immune responses."
