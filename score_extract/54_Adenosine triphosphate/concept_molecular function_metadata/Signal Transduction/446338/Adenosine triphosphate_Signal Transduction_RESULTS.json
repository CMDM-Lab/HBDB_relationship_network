    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule for signal transduction in T cells, particularly through its release via panx1 channels and its role in purinergic signaling. The study indicates that mitochondrial ATP production and ATP release are essential for T cell activation and function, linking ATP directly to the mechanisms of signal transduction in immune responses."
