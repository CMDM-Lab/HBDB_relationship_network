    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction during T cell activation. The stimulation of T cells leads to a rapid increase in ATP production, which is essential for purinergic signaling mechanisms that regulate T cell functions. This ATP release and subsequent signaling are vital for intracellular calcium signaling and the activation of immune responses, highlighting the direct relationship between ATP and signal transduction in immune cell function."
