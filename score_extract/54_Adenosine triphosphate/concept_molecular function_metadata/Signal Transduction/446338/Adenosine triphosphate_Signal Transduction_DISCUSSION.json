    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in signal transduction, particularly in T cell activation. The release of ATP into the extracellular space stimulates P2X receptors, which are ATP-gated Ca2+ channels, facilitating calcium influx. This process amplifies TCR/CD28 signaling and sustains calcium influx, highlighting ATP's integral function in modulating cellular signaling pathways and immune responses."
