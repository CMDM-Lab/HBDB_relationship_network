    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a crucial molecule in purinergic signaling within the nervous system, particularly in relation to neuronal transmission. ATP acts at P2 receptors, contributing to synaptic currents and facilitating communication between neurons and glial cells. The review emphasizes ATP's role in various aspects of neuronal function, including development and pathology, indicating its significant involvement in neuronal transmission processes."
