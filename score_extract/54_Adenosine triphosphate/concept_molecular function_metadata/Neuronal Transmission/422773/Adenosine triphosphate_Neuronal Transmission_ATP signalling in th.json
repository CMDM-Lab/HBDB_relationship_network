    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is implicated in neuronal transmission within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), where it plays a role in mediating the sympathoexcitatory response to chemoreceptor stimulation. ATP is released rhythmically alongside glutamate, influencing the firing of NTS neurons that relay information from pulmonary stretch receptors. This suggests that ATP is crucial for neurotransmission in the reflex pathways that regulate respiratory and cardiovascular functions."
