    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is linked to mitochondrial uptake processes during T cell stimulation. The study highlights that stimulation leads to rapid bursts of intracellular ATP release from activated mitochondria, indicating a direct relationship between ATP production and its uptake by cells. This suggests that ATP plays a crucial role in cellular energy dynamics and signaling during immune responses."
