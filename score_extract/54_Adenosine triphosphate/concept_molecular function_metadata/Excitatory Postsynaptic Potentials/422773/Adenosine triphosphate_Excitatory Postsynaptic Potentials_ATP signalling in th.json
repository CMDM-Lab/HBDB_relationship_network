    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is described as a signaling molecule that interacts with the P2Y1 purinergic receptor to influence neuronal activity in the enteric nervous system (ENS). ATP co-released with acetylcholine (ACh) contributes to the generation of slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in secretomotor neurons, indicating its role in modulating excitatory signaling and contractile activity in the gastrointestinal tract. This highlights ATP's critical involvement in the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission within the ENS."
