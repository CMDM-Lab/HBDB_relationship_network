    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glycolysis are closely related through their roles in T cell activation. While mitochondria produce ATP, glycolysis is identified as the primary pathway for ATP generation in activated T cells. This indicates that glycolysis is crucial for meeting the ATP demands during T cell activation, highlighting a significant metabolic shift in immune responses."
