    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as a critical energy molecule produced primarily through glycolysis in resting Jurkat cells, while primary CD4+ T cells generate ATP mainly via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The study emphasizes the role of glycolysis in ATP production under specific conditions, indicating a direct relationship between ATP levels and glycolytic activity in T cells."
