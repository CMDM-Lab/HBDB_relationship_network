    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is highlighted as the primary energy carrier essential for cellular processes, particularly in T cells. The text discusses how T cell activation leads to a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis, which is crucial for ATP production in rapidly dividing T cells. This indicates a direct relationship where glycolysis is a key pathway for generating ATP during T cell activation, emphasizing the importance of glycolysis in meeting the energy demands of these cells."
