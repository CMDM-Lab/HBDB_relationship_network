    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is measured using a bioluminescence assay, specifically the ATP Bioluminescence HS II assay kit. This method relies on the light emitted during the reaction of ATP with luciferase, which is a key aspect of bioluminescence. The relationship highlights ATP's role as a critical energy molecule in cellular processes, with bioluminescence serving as a sensitive detection method for ATP levels in biological samples."
