    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is measured using a bioluminescence assay to assess ATP release from Jurkat cells after stimulation. The bioluminescence method provides a quantitative measure of ATP levels, which are crucial for evaluating cellular energy status and function during T cell activation. This indicates a direct relationship where bioluminescence serves as a tool to quantify ATP, linking the two terms closely in the context of cellular metabolism and immune response."
