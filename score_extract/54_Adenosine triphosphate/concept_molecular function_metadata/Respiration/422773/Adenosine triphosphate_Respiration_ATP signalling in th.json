    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a crucial role in the regulation of respiration. It is released in response to changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, influencing the activity of respiratory neurons in the medulla oblongata. ATP enhances the respiratory rhythm and helps adapt breathing patterns during hypoxia and hypercapnia, indicating a direct and significant relationship between ATP and respiratory function."
