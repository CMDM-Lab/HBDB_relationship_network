    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is closely linked to respiration, particularly in the study of phosphorylation efficiencies during hypoxia. The ADP/O ratios indicate how respiration is influenced by ADP availability, with a notable decline in these ratios as respiration becomes limited by ADP rather than oxygen. This highlights the critical role of ATP in energy production during respiratory processes, especially under varying oxygen conditions."
