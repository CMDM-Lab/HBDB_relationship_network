    "summary": "In this context, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly linked to respiration as it is produced during oxidative phosphorylation, a key metabolic process occurring in mitochondria. The study highlights how low oxygen levels can restrict respiration and ATP supply, leading to metabolic failure. It emphasizes the importance of efficient ATP synthesis under varying oxygen conditions, indicating that respiration is crucial for maintaining ATP levels, especially in hypoxic environments."
