    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker of oxidative stress associated with traffic-related pollutants, particularly in children with asthma. The study highlights that increased MDA levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) correlate with lower lung function and elevated IL-8 secretion, suggesting that MDA may serve as a useful tool for assessing the impact of air pollution on asthma patients. This indicates a significant relationship between MDA and asthma, particularly in the context of environmental exposure."
