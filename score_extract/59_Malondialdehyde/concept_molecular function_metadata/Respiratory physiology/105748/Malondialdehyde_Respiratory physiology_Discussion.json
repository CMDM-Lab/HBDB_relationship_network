    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker for oxidative stress related to traffic-related pollutants, which negatively impacts respiratory physiology, particularly lung function in children with asthma. The study highlights the association between elevated MDA levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and decreased lung function, indicating its potential role in assessing respiratory health in polluted environments."
