    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde levels are evaluated in relation to pulmonary function, specifically forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1. The study employs generalized estimating equation models to assess the association between malondialdehyde and these measures of lung function, indicating a potential link between oxidative stress (as indicated by malondialdehyde) and respiratory health outcomes. However, the specific nature of this relationship is not fully detailed, focusing instead on statistical associations."
