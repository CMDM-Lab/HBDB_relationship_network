    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess the effects of traffic-related pollutants on lung function in children with asthma. The study highlights the association between elevated MDA levels and decreased lung function, indicating that exhalation of MDA can reflect oxidative stress due to environmental exposures. This suggests a significant relationship between MDA and exhalation as a means of monitoring respiratory health in susceptible populations."
