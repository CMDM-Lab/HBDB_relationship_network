    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is identified as a biomarker of oxidative stress associated with traffic-related pollutants, particularly in children with asthma. While the study highlights the role of MDA in lung function and inflammation (e.g., IL-8 secretion), it does not explicitly connect MDA to exocytosis. Exocytosis, a cellular process for releasing substances, may be indirectly related to the inflammatory response but is not directly discussed in relation to MDA in this study."
