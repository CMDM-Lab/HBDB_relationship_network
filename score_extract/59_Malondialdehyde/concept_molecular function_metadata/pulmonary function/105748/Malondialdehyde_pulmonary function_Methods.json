    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels are evaluated for their association with pulmonary function, specifically forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1. The study employs generalized estimating equation models to analyze how changes in MDA levels correlate with lung function metrics, indicating a potential link between oxidative stress, as represented by MDA, and respiratory health outcomes. The analysis also considers asthma severity as a modifying factor in this relationship."
