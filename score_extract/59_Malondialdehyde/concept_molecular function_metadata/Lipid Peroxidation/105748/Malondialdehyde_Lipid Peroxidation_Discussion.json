    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is discussed as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress, which is often a consequence of lipid peroxidation. Although MDA is not a specific product of lipid peroxidation, it is frequently used to indicate oxidative damage in biological samples. The study highlights the correlation between elevated MDA levels and oxidative stress in various occupational exposures, suggesting that while MDA can signal lipid peroxidation, its reliability as a sole marker is debated."
