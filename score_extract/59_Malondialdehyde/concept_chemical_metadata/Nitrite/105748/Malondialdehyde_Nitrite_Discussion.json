    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde and nitrite are both mentioned as biological markers of oxidative stress, particularly in relation to exposure to diesel exhaust. The study indicates that higher levels of malondialdehyde were observed alongside increased nitrite+nitrate levels in workers exposed to diesel, suggesting a potential relationship where both compounds may reflect oxidative damage and stress in the body due to environmental pollutants."
