    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde is presented as a biomarker of oxidative stress that varies with exposure to air pollutants, particularly ozone and PM2.5. The study indicates that malondialdehyde levels can reflect the extent of oxidative stress injury caused by pollutants, suggesting a direct relationship between ozone exposure and increased malondialdehyde levels in children with asthma. This connection highlights the role of ozone as a significant contributor to oxidative stress and its potential health impacts."
