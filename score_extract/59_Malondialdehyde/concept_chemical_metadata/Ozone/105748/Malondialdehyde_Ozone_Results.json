    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is presented as a biomarker for oxidative stress associated with exposure to ozone. The study indicates that an increase in malondialdehyde levels correlates with ozone exposure, as well as with traffic-related pollutants. The significant association between ozone and malondialdehyde suggests that ozone exposure may contribute to oxidative damage, which is further linked to adverse health outcomes such as reduced lung function and increased inflammatory markers."
