    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is analyzed in relation to traffic-related pollutants, including ozone. The study investigates the association between MDA levels in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and exposure to ozone, among other pollutants. The statistical analysis aims to determine how varying levels of ozone exposure correlate with MDA, a marker of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, suggesting a potential link between ozone pollution and increased oxidative damage in individuals exposed to traffic-related air pollutants."
