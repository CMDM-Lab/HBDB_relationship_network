    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde is highlighted as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress, particularly in workers exposed to various pollutants, including tungsten. Elevated levels of malondialdehyde have been observed in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of individuals exposed to tungsten, indicating a relationship between tungsten exposure and oxidative stress as measured by malondialdehyde levels. This suggests that tungsten may contribute to oxidative damage, which is reflected in increased malondialdehyde concentrations."
