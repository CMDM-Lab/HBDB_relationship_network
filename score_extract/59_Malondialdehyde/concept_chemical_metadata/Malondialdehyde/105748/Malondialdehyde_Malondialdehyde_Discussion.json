    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is highlighted as a biomarker for oxidative stress related to traffic-related pollutants, particularly in children with asthma. The study demonstrates that elevated MDA levels correlate with reduced lung function and increased IL-8 secretion, indicating its potential utility in epidemiological studies of air pollution effects on respiratory health. The focus on MDA emphasizes its significance in assessing the impact of environmental factors on health outcomes."
