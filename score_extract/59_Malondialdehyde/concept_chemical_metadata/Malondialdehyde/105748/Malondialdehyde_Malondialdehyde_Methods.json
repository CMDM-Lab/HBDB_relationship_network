    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) is evaluated as a biomarker for oxidative stress and its association with pulmonary function and inflammatory markers such as IL-8. The study investigates how MDA levels correlate with forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 in relation to asthma severity and pollutant exposure. The analysis suggests that MDA levels may provide insights into respiratory health outcomes, particularly in children exposed to environmental pollutants."
