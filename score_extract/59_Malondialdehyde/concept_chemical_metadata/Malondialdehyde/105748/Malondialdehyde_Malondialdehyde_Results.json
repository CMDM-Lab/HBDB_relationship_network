    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde is discussed as a biomarker associated with health outcomes, particularly lung function and inflammation. The study shows that higher levels of malondialdehyde correlate with decreased FEV1 and FVC, as well as increased IL-8 levels in nasal lavage. This indicates that malondialdehyde is directly related to the adverse effects of traffic-related pollutants on respiratory health, highlighting its potential as a noninvasive marker in epidemiological studies."
