    "summary": "In this context, malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrate are both mentioned as biological markers associated with oxidative stress, particularly in individuals exposed to diesel exhaust. The study indicates that higher levels of malondialdehyde correlate with increased nitrite+nitrate levels in plasma, suggesting a potential relationship where both compounds may serve as indicators of oxidative damage in occupational settings. However, the specific interaction between MDA and nitrate is not deeply explored beyond their association with oxidative stress."
