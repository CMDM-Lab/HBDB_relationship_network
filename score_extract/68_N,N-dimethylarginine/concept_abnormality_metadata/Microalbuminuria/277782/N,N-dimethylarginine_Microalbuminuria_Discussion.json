    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed as an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, with elevated levels observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). The study indicates that plasma ADMA levels have prognostic implications for the progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria in diabetic patients, suggesting a potential link between ADMA and the inflammatory processes at the glomerular level that may contribute to microalbuminuria development."
