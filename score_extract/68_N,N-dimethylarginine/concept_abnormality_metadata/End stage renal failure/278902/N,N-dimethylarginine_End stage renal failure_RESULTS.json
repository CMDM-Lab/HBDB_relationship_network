    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed in relation to end-stage renal failure (ESRD) patients, where its levels are significantly elevated compared to controls. The study indicates that dialysis reduces ADMA levels, but they remain higher than those in healthy individuals. This suggests a potential link between elevated ADMA and the pathophysiology of ESRD, highlighting its role as a biomarker for renal dysfunction."
