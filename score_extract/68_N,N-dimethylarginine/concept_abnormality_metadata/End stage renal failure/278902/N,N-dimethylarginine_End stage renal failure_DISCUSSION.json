    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed in relation to end-stage renal failure (ESRD) patients, where elevated levels of ADMA were observed compared to controls. ADMA is known to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, which is crucial for vascular function. The study highlights that increased ADMA levels in ESRD patients may contribute to impaired NO production, potentially exacerbating vascular complications associated with the disease."
