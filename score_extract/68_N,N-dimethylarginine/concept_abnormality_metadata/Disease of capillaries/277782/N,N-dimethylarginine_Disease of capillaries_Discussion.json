    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is implicated in diabetic cerebral microangiopathy, a disease affecting capillaries. Elevated plasma ADMA levels are associated with increased vascular stiffness and decreased cerebral perfusion in diabetic patients, contributing to microangiopathy-related cerebral damage. The study highlights a direct correlation between plasma ADMA and vascular resistance metrics, indicating its role in capillary disease pathology."
