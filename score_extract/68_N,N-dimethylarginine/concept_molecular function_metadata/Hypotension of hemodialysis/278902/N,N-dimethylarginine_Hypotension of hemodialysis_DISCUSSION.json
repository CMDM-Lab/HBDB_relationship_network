    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed in relation to its role in nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, which is crucial for regulating vascular resistance and blood pressure. The study indicates that while ADMA levels did not significantly differ between patients with and without intra-dialytic hypotension, the overall dynamics of NO and other related factors like endothelin-1 (ET-1) are implicated in the development of hypotension during hemodialysis. This suggests a complex interplay where ADMA may influence hypotension indirectly through its effects on NO synthesis."
