    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is associated with inflammation in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Elevated plasma ADMA levels correlate with inflammatory markers and suggest an inflammatory state at the glomerular level, potentially indicating early endothelial impairment in normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetes patients. This relationship highlights ADMA's role as a prognostic marker for renal function decline linked to inflammation."
