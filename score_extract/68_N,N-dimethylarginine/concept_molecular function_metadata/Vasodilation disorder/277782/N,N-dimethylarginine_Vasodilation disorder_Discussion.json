    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is highlighted as a significant endogenous modulator of cerebral vasculature tone, particularly in patients with endothelial dysfunction. The study indicates that elevated levels of ADMA correlate with impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation in cerebral vessels during hypercapnia, suggesting a direct relationship between ADMA and vasodilation disorders, especially in the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)."
