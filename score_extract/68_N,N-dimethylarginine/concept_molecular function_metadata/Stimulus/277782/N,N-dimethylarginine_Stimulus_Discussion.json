    "summary": "In this context, N,N-dimethylarginine (ADMA) is discussed as an endogenous modulator of cerebral vascular tone, particularly in response to vasoreactive stimuli such as hypercapnia. The study indicates that ADMA levels correlate with impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation during these stimuli, suggesting its role in regulating cerebral blood flow under conditions of increased carbon dioxide. Thus, ADMA's relationship with stimuli is significant in understanding its impact on cerebral perfusion, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus."
