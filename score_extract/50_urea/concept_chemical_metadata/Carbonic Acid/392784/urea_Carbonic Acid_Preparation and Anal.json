    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbonic acid are related through the decomposition of urea in aqueous solution, which produces carbonic acid, acetic acid, and ammonia upon boiling. This reaction highlights a chemical transformation where urea breaks down into carbonic acid, suggesting a direct relationship in the context of urea's behavior in solution and its potential implications in biological systems, such as the formation of calculi in the bladder."
