    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbonic acid are directly related through the enzymatic activity of H. pylori urease, which metabolizes urea into ammonia and carbonic acid. This reaction is significant as it alters the gastric pH, potentially promoting bacterial growth and contributing to gastric epithelial cell damage. The production of carbonic acid alongside ammonia is crucial in understanding the biochemical interactions that affect gastric health in the presence of H. pylori infection."
