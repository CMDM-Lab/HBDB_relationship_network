    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbonic acid are directly related through the biochemical reaction facilitated by Helicobacter pylori, which hydrolyzes urea into ammonia and carbonic acid. This reaction is crucial for the 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT), a diagnostic method for H. pylori infection. The production of ammonia and carbonic acid helps the bacterium survive in the acidic environment of the stomach, highlighting their significant interaction in the context of bacterial colonization and infection diagnosis."
