    "summary": "In this context, urea and methylamines are discussed in relation to their roles in the physiological adaptations of frogs during freeze-thaw cycles. Urea is noted for its potential inhibitory effects on glycolytic enzymes, which may impact glucose clearance. In contrast, methylamines are mentioned as protective solutes that amphibians do not accumulate to counteract urea's effects, suggesting a complex interplay between these compounds in metabolic processes during stress recovery."
