    "summary": "In this context, urea and non-protein nitrogen are related through their roles in nitrogen metabolism and retention in dietary formulations. The study indicates that a higher proportion of non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen in a formula led to increased urea balance, but decreased nitrogen utilization efficiency. This suggests a complex interaction where non-protein nitrogen influences urea dynamics and overall nitrogen retention in the body."
