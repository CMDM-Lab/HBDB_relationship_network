    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in protein unfolding, particularly in comparison to GdnHCl, which dissociates into cations and anions. The mention of anions arises from the ionic strength effect attributed to GdnHCl's greater unfolding capacity compared to urea. While urea is a neutral molecule, the presence of anions from GdnHCl is suggested to influence protein stability and unfolding dynamics. However, the relationship between urea and anions is indirect, focusing more on the comparative effects of these substances rather than a direct interaction."
