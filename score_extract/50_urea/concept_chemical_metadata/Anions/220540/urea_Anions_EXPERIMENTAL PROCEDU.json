    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a component in the purification process of histones through dialysis and chromatography. Anions, specifically in the form of sodium chloride (NaCl), are involved in the elution process during anion exchange chromatography. While urea serves as a denaturing agent to solubilize proteins, anions like NaCl are crucial for separating proteins based on their charge. The relationship is functional, as both are integral to the purification protocol, but they do not interact directly."
