    "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonia nitrogen are both measured as components of nitrogenous waste excretion in aquatic animals. The study examines the fluxes of urea and ammonia nitrogen into the water, indicating their roles in nitrogen metabolism and excretion. Urea is calculated to account for two nitrogen atoms, while ammonia nitrogen is assessed for its flux rates, highlighting their interconnectedness in nitrogen waste management."
