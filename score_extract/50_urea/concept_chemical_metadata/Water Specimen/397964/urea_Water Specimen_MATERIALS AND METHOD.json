    "summary": "In this context, urea and water specimens are directly related through the examination of nitrogenous waste excretion in aquatic animals. The study measures urea nitrogen content in water samples to assess urea fluxes, indicating how urea is released into the water as a waste product. This relationship highlights the role of water as a medium for monitoring urea levels in the environment, particularly in studies of animal physiology and waste management."
