    "summary": "In this context, urea and amino groups are related through the urea cycle, which is crucial for the detoxification of ammonia generated from amino acid metabolism. The overactivity of GDH1 leads to increased free ammonium ions, which can disrupt the urea cycle. Aminotransferases facilitate the transfer of amino groups, linking amino acid metabolism to urea production. Thus, the relationship highlights the metabolic pathway where amino groups are converted into urea, a key process for nitrogen excretion in the body."
