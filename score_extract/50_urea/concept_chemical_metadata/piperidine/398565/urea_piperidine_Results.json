    "summary": "In this context, urea and piperidine are related through their involvement in the structure and function of a compound that inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The urea moiety is part of a piperidine-urea compound (PF-750) that interacts with the enzyme's active site, where the urea carbonyl is acylated by the catalytic serine residue. This indicates a significant functional relationship between the two in the context of enzyme inhibition."
