    "summary": "In this context, urea and piperidine are mentioned as components of a compound identified through high-throughput screening (HTS) as a potential inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The relationship is primarily structural, as piperidine is part of the chemical structure of the urea compound that exhibits inhibitory activity. However, the specific interactions or functional roles of urea and piperidine in the mechanism of action are not elaborated upon in detail."
