    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which facilitates urea excretion at the gill. Phloretin is mentioned as an inhibitor of tUT, demonstrating its role in blocking urea permeability when tUT is expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This indicates a direct functional relationship where Phloretin affects the transport of urea by inhibiting the transporter."
