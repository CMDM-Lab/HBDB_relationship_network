    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbon are related through the use of carbon isotopes in breath tests to detect urease activity, particularly in the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. The urea breath test utilizes radiolabeled carbon (13C, 14C) to measure the presence of urease, which breaks down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, indicating bacterial activity. This highlights the biochemical interaction where urea serves as a substrate for urease, producing carbon as a byproduct, thus linking the two terms in a diagnostic context."
