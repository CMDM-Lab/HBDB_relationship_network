    "summary": "In this context, urea is analyzed in terms of its elemental composition, which includes carbon as one of its fundamental components. Prout's analysis involved combustion methods to determine the percentage of carbon in urea, highlighting the significance of carbon in understanding urea's chemical structure. However, the relationship is primarily focused on analytical methods rather than a direct biochemical interaction."
