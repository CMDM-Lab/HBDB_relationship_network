    "summary": "In this context, urea and cyanates are closely related through the biochemical processes occurring in chronic renal failure. Urea is suggested to be a uremic toxin, and it spontaneously forms cyanate, which is elevated in this condition. The increased levels of cyanate lead to protein carbamylation, contributing to oxidative stress and altering protein function, indicating a significant toxicological relationship between urea and cyanates in the context of renal failure."
