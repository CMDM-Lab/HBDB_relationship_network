    "summary": "In this context, urea and cyanates are related through their interaction in a biochemical environment. The study indicates that urea can influence the concentration of cyanate, with a specific equilibrium concentration of cyanate observed in a urea solution. Furthermore, high levels of urea are shown to cause protein carbonylation in mIMCD3 cells, suggesting a direct effect of urea rather than an indirect effect from cyanate. This highlights a significant biochemical relationship where urea plays a crucial role in the behavior of cyanate and its effects on cellular proteins."
