    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to cyanates as cyanate forms spontaneously from urea. The study evaluates the effects of cyanate in urea solutions, indicating a chemical transformation where urea serves as a precursor to cyanate. This relationship is significant as it highlights the potential implications of urea in generating cyanate, which may have further biological or chemical effects."
