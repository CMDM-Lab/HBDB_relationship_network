    "summary": "In this context, urea is involved in the mechanism of inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) by compound 1, which contains the 2-fluoroaniline moiety. The urea carbonyl is acylated by the catalytic nucleophile Ser241, with 2-fluoroaniline acting as the leaving group. This indicates a direct chemical interaction where urea plays a crucial role in the inhibition process, highlighting its significance in the compound's mechanism of action."
