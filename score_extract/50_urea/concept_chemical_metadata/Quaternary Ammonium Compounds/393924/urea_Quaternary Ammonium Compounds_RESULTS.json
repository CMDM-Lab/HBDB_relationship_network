    "summary": "In this context, urea and quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are both examined for their effects on the uptake of methylamine (MA) via the RhAG transporter. The study indicates that neither urea nor glutamine inhibited MA uptake, while quaternary ammonium compounds like tetramethyl- and tetraethylammonium chloride also did not affect this process. This suggests that urea and QACs do not have a direct competitive relationship in the context of MA transport."
