    "summary": "In this context, urea and protons are related through the function of the UreI transporter, which is hypothesized to be activated by protons. The study suggests that while urea uptake occurs, it is not electrogenic, indicating that protons may play a role in activating the transporter without directly influencing the urea transport process. The lack of saturation and temperature independence further imply a specific interaction between protons and the UreI transporter in facilitating urea flux."
