    "summary": "In this context, urea is involved in the synthesis of cellobiose ureide, which is produced by dissolving d-cellobiose and urea in boiling water. The boiling water serves as a solvent to facilitate the reaction between urea and d-cellobiose, indicating a direct relationship where boiled water is essential for the dissolution and subsequent reaction of urea in the synthesis process."
