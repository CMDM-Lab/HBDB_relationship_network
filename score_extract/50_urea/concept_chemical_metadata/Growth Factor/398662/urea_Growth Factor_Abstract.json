    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to have a significant impact on cellular signaling pathways, particularly in mouse renal inner medullary cells. High concentrations of urea activate mitogenic signaling proteins and increase the transcription and activity of the immediate-early gene Egr-1, which is associated with growth factor signaling. This suggests that urea can influence growth factor-related pathways, potentially affecting cell growth and function under conditions of high urea concentration, such as in uremia."
