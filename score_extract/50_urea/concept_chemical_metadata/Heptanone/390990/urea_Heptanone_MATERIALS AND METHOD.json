    "summary": "In this context, urea and heptanone are mentioned in a biochemical procedure involving the extraction and purification of glycoproteins from T. brucei. Urea is used in the solubilization process of cell components, while heptanone is included as a reagent in the buffer for affinity chromatography. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship between urea and heptanone beyond their roles in the experimental setup."
