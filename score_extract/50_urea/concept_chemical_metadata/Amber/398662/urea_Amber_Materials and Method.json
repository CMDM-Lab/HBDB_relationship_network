    "summary": "In this context, urea and Amber are connected through the use of a conductivity meter from Amber Science to measure cyanate levels in urea solutions. The experiment involves mixing urea with a resin to remove cyanate, and the conductivity meter is used to compare the conductivity of treated urea solutions with potassium cyanate standards. This indicates that Amber Science's equipment plays a crucial role in assessing the effects of cyanate derived from urea."
