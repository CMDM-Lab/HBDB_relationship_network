    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a solubilizing agent in the extraction process of membrane-associated glycoconjugates from T. brucei cells. The presence of urea aids in breaking down cellular structures, allowing for the effective extraction of glycoproteins that are linked to glycoconjugates. However, the specific biochemical relationship between urea and glycoconjugates is not elaborated upon beyond this extraction method."
