    "summary": "In this context, urea and sulfates are mentioned in relation to the surface chemistry of N-doped TiO2 photocatalysts. The study indicates that there were no significant residuals of sulfate ions or urea species on the photocatalyst's surface after testing. This suggests that while both compounds are present in the discussion, their direct relationship or interaction is not explored, indicating a lack of significant relevance between them in this specific context."
