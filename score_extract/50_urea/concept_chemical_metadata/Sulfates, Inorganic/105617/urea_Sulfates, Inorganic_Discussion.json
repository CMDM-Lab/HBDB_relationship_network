    "summary": "In this context, urea and inorganic sulfates are mentioned in relation to the surface chemistry of N-doped TiO2. The study indicates that there was no significant residual of sulfate ions or urea species on the surface after photocatalytic activity evaluation. However, their specific interactions or roles in the degradation process of VOCs are not discussed, indicating a lack of direct relevance between them."
