    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbohydrates are mentioned in relation to the hydrolysis of glycosyl ureides in human intestinal enzymes. The study indicates that while carbohydrates like maltose and lactose can be hydrolyzed into free sugars, no free urea was detected, suggesting that the bond between urea and carbohydrate moieties remains intact under the tested conditions. This highlights a lack of interaction between urea and carbohydrates in the digestive process."
