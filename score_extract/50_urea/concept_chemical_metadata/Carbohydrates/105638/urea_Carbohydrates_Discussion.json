    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbohydrates are discussed in relation to their interactions with intestinal enzymes. The study indicates that the molecular bond between carbohydrate moieties and urea is resistant to human intestinal enzymes, suggesting that urea does not readily interact or break down with carbohydrates in the digestive process. This highlights a lack of significant enzymatic activity involving urea and carbohydrates in the human intestine."
