    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the 13C-urea breath test, which assesses urease activity in the stomach as an indicator of H. pylori colonization. Bismuth is mentioned in relation to a classic triple therapy for H. pylori treatment. However, the study indicates no correlation between the 13C-urea breath test values and the effectiveness of bismuth-based therapy, suggesting that while both terms are related to H. pylori treatment, their direct relationship is weak and not supported by the findings."
