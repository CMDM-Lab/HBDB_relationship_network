    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to isotopes through the use of 14C-urea breath testing, a diagnostic method for assessing gastric function. The discussion highlights the advantages of using 14C over 13C due to cost and ease of use, while also addressing safety concerns related to radiation exposure from the isotope. The relationship is primarily focused on the application of isotopes in medical testing involving urea."
