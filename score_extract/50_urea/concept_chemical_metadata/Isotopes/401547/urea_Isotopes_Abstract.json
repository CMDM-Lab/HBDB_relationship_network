    "summary": "In this context, urea and isotopes are related through the study of nitrogen retention and the enrichment of 15N-labeled urea in infants consuming different formulas. The research indicates that the presence of dietary urea can dilute the isotopic label in urinary urea, affecting the measurement of nitrogen utilization efficiency. This highlights the interaction between urea metabolism and isotopic labeling in assessing nitrogen balance."
