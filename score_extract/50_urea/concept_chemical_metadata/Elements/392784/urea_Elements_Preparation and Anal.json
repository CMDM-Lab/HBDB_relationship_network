    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its elemental composition, specifically how William Prout analyzed the percentage of its constituent elements. Prout's analysis demonstrated that the elemental composition of urea matched the values derived from its chemical formula, highlighting the relationship between urea and its elemental components, particularly nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. This connection emphasizes the foundational understanding of urea's chemical structure based on its elemental makeup."
