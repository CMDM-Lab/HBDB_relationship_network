    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a substrate in a breath test for diagnosing H. pylori infection, specifically utilizing 13C-urea with a specified atom percent excess. The term 'atom' refers to the isotopic composition of the urea used in the test, indicating the presence of the carbon-13 isotope. While urea is crucial for the test's function, the relationship with 'atom' is primarily technical, focusing on the isotopic labeling rather than a biological or chemical interaction."
