    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a component of a breath test for detecting H. pylori infection, where patients ingest 13C-urea. The term 'atom' refers to the isotopic composition of the urea used in the test, specifically the 13C isotope. While both terms are present, their relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the use of urea's atomic structure for diagnostic purposes rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction."
