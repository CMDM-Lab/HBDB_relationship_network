    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a tracer in a breath test to diagnose H. pylori infection in children. The term 'atom' refers to the isotopic composition of the urea, specifically the 13C atom used to measure enrichment in breath samples. While both terms are mentioned, their relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the use of urea's isotopic labeling rather than a direct biological or chemical interaction."
