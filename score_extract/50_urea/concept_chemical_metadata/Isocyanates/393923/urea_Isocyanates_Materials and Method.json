    "summary": "In this context, urea and isocyanates are related through a synthetic process where isocyanates are used as intermediates in the preparation of urea analogs. Specifically, the synthesis of the urea analog O-1987 involves the reaction of arachidonic acid with its isocyanate, indicating a direct chemical relationship where isocyanates serve as precursors in urea formation. This highlights the functional role of isocyanates in the synthesis of urea derivatives."
