    "summary": "In this context, urea and bicarbonates are mentioned in a biochemical experiment involving mIMCD3 cells. Bicarbonate is used in the homogenization buffer, which is essential for maintaining pH and facilitating reactions involving urea. The relationship suggests that bicarbonate may play a role in the biochemical processes where urea is involved, particularly in protein carbonylation, although the direct interaction between urea and bicarbonates is not explicitly detailed."
