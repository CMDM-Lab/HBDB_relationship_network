    "summary": "In this context, urea and bicarbonates are interconnected through the urea cycle, where ammonia and carbon dioxide (in the form of bicarbonate) are utilized to synthesize amino acids like citrulline and arginine. The activity of carbonic anhydrase is essential for supplying bicarbonate from carbon dioxide, indicating a metabolic relationship between urea production and bicarbonate utilization in amino acid metabolism."
