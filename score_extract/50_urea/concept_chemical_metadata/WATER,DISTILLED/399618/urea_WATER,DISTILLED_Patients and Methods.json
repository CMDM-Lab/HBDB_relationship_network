    "summary": "In this context, urea and distilled water are connected through the 13C-urea breath test, where subjects ingested a solution of 125 mg 13C-urea dissolved in 125 mL of distilled water. The distilled water serves as the solvent for the urea, facilitating its administration for the breath test, which is used to assess urease activity in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the relationship is primarily functional, with no deeper biochemical interaction discussed."
