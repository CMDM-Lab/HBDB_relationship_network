    "summary": "In this context, urea and the nonionic detergent C12E8 are related through the study of urease activity in H. pylori. The detergent was used to permeabilize the bacterial membrane, allowing urea to access the cytoplasm and activate urease. The results indicated that membrane permeabilization with C12E8 enhanced urease activity, demonstrating the role of the cytoplasmic membrane in restricting urea diffusion into the cell."
