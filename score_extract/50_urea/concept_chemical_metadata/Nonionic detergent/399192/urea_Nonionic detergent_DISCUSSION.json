    "summary": "In this context, urea and nonionic detergent are related through their roles in modifying membrane permeability in H. pylori. The addition of low concentrations of nonionic detergent enhances urea permeability, which in turn activates cytoplasmic urease activity under acidic conditions. This suggests that nonionic detergents can facilitate urea's role in acid survival by increasing its availability for urease activity, crucial for the bacterium's adaptation to gastric environments."
