    "summary": "In this context, urea is a key reactant in the synthesis of cellobiose-ureide, which is produced through the acid-catalyzed condensation of d-cellobiose and urea. The process involves dissolving both components in boiling water, adjusting the pH, and heating to facilitate the formation of the ureide compound. This indicates a direct chemical relationship where urea is essential for the creation of cellobiose-ureide."
