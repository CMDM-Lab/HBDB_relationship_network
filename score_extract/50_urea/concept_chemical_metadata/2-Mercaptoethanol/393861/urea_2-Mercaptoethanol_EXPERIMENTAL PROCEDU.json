    "summary": "In this context, urea and 2-mercaptoethanol are both mentioned as denaturants used in the heat denaturation process of LCI in a Tris-HCl buffer. Urea and 2-mercaptoethanol are employed to disrupt protein structures, but their specific roles or interactions in the denaturation process are not elaborated upon. They are part of a broader experimental setup aimed at analyzing protein behavior under denaturing conditions."
