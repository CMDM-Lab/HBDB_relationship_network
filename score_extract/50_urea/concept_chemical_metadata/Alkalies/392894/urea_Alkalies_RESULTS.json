    "summary": "In this context, urea and alkalies are mentioned in relation to their roles in the extraction and analysis of integral membrane proteins. Urea is used at a concentration of 5 m to treat samples, while alkali extraction is performed at a pH of 11.3. Both treatments are part of the methodology to investigate the properties of membrane proteins, specifically their resistance to extraction by these agents. However, the relationship is primarily methodological rather than functional or biochemical."
