    "summary": "In this context, urea and keto acids are related through the metabolic processes involving amino acid metabolism and the urea cycle. The overactivity of GDH1 leads to increased free ammonium ions, which can affect the urea cycle's initiation. Additionally, aminotransferases facilitate the transfer of amino groups between amino acids and keto acids, linking these two terms in the context of nitrogen metabolism and energy production in the liver."
