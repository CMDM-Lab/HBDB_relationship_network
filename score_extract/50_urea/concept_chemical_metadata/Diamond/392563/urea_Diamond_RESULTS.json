    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to induce the unfolding of two isoforms of a protein, sAPPα695 and sAPPα770, which are represented by different symbols (cross-hair and diamond, respectively). The diamond symbol specifically denotes the unfolding process of sAPPα770 in the presence of urea, indicating a direct experimental relationship where urea facilitates the unfolding of this protein isoform. However, the context does not elaborate on any further functional significance of this relationship."
