    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant that stabilizes the random-coil structure of the peptide PrP (109â€“141) in the presence of high concentrations. While organic solvents are referenced in relation to the peptide's structural properties, the specific relationship between urea and organic solvent products is not directly discussed. Urea's role is primarily as a stabilizing agent rather than interacting with organic solvents in a significant manner."
