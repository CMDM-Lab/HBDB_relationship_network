    "summary": "In this context, urea and saline are related through the study of urea appearance rates in mucosal saline solutions of fasted fish exposed to antibiotics. The results indicate that the presence of saline influences the urea concentration, with variations observed based on the fish's feeding status and treatment conditions. Saline serves as a medium for measuring urea levels, highlighting its role in the physiological response of fish to different dietary and treatment conditions."
