    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to metabolites as it is a product of the urea cycle, which processes excess nitrogen in the body to prevent the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous metabolites. Urea serves as a water-soluble waste product, indicating its role in metabolite management, particularly in conditions like urea-cycle disorders that lead to hyperammonemia and the buildup of harmful metabolites. The study highlights the importance of urea in mitigating the effects of toxic metabolites in the brain, particularly in neonatal-onset hyperammonemic encephalopathy."
