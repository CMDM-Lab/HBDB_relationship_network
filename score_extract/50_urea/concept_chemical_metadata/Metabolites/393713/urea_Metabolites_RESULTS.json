    "summary": "In this context, urea is described as a terminal metabolite produced through the urea cycle, which is crucial for detoxifying ammonia generated from amino acid catabolism. The study highlights the relationship between urea levels and ammonia in liver-specific HNF4Î±-null mice, indicating that urea serves as a key metabolite in the elimination of toxic ammonia, thus linking urea directly to metabolic processes in the liver."
