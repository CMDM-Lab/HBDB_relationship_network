    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to metabolites through its role in the urea cycle, which is affected by the accumulation of fatty acyl-CoA metabolites due to disrupted fatty acid oxidation. Conditions like medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency lead to hyperammonemia, which can inhibit the urea cycle, highlighting the importance of metabolites in metabolic disorders and their impact on urea production and regulation."
