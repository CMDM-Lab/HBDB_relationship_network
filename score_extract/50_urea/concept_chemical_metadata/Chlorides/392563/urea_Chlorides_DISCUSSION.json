    "summary": "In this context, urea and chlorides are discussed in relation to their effects on protein unfolding. Urea is a neutral molecule used to unfold proteins, while chlorides, as part of GdnHCl, contribute to ionic strength, enhancing the unfolding process. The study suggests that the presence of chlorides (from NaCl) can mimic the ionic strength of GdnHCl, indicating a potential interaction between urea's unfolding ability and the ionic environment created by chlorides."
