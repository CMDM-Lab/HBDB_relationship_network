    "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are closely related through the urea cycle, which is a metabolic pathway that converts excess nitrogen into urea, a non-toxic waste product. This process is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic nitrogenous compounds in the body, particularly in patients with urea-cycle disorders. The urea cycle's function highlights the importance of nitrogen metabolism in maintaining physiological balance and preventing hyperammonemia."
