    "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are closely related through the process of nitrogen metabolism in the teleost intestine. Ureolytic bacteria utilize urea, breaking it down into ammonia, which releases nitrogen groups that can be used for protein synthesis. This indicates a significant role of urea in nitrogen cycling and metabolism within the intestinal ecosystem of the fish."
