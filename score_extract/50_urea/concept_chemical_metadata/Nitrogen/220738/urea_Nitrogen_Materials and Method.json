    "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are closely related through the discussion of nitrogen balance in patients undergoing dialysis. Urea is a key nitrogenous waste product formed from protein metabolism, and its clearance is used to assess nitrogen appearance rates in the body. The normalized protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance (nPNA) is derived from urea measurements, indicating the importance of urea in evaluating nitrogen status in patients."
