    "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen are related through the measurement of nitrogen appearance in patients undergoing dialysis. Urea is a nitrogenous waste product formed in the liver from the breakdown of proteins, and its levels are often assessed in relation to nitrogen balance in patients. The study includes urea kinetic studies, which evaluate nitrogen metabolism and excretion in dialysis patients, highlighting the importance of urea as a key indicator of nitrogen status in the body."
