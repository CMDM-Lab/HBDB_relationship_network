    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to induce protein carbonylation in mIMCD3 cells, with the carbonylation process being influenced by urea concentration. The study indicates that even normal plasma levels of urea (5 mM) can lead to significant carbonylation, which peaks at 20 mM. Higher concentrations may lead to further oxidation of carbonyl groups to carboxylic acids, suggesting a direct relationship between urea levels and the formation of carbonyl groups in proteins, particularly in conditions of renal failure where urea levels are elevated."
