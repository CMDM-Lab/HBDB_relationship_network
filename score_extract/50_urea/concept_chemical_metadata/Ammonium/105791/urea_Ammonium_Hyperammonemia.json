    "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium are indirectly related through the discussion of hyperammonemia, a condition characterized by elevated ammonium levels in the blood. Urea is a product of the urea cycle, which detoxifies ammonia (derived from protein metabolism) into urea for excretion. The context highlights the significance of ammonium levels in various metabolic disorders, including those affecting the urea cycle, but does not provide a direct interaction between urea and ammonium."
