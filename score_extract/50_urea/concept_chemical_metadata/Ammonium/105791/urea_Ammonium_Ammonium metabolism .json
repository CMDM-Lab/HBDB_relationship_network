    "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium are interconnected through the urea cycle, where ammonia (derived from ammonium) is utilized by hepatocytes to synthesize carbamoylphosphate, a key step in urea production. The liver's ability to convert ammonium into urea is crucial for nitrogen metabolism and detoxification, highlighting their significant biochemical relationship in maintaining metabolic homeostasis."
