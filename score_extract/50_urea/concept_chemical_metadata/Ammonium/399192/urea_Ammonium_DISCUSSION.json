    "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium (NH4+) are discussed in relation to their transport mechanisms across membranes. The text suggests that ammonium, being a cation, requires active transport processes, potentially involving a urea-ammonium antiporter. This indicates a functional relationship where urea may facilitate the transport of ammonium, highlighting their interconnected roles in cellular processes, particularly in the context of pH regulation and ion transport."
