    "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium are connected through the degradation of ureides in soybean cell cultures. The evidence suggests that ureides are primarily degraded to ammonium via the amidohydrolase pathway, with minimal involvement of urea-releasing enzymes. This indicates a direct biochemical relationship where urea is a less significant byproduct in the conversion of ureides to ammonium."
