    "summary": "In this context, urea and ammonium are connected through biochemical measurement methods. Urea can be converted to ammonium through the action of urease, which is mentioned as a method for determining urea concentration. This indicates a direct biochemical relationship where urea metabolism leads to the production of ammonium, highlighting their interdependence in nitrogen metabolism."
