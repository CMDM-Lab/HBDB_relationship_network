    "summary": "In this context, urea and Carbon 13 are connected through the carbon 13-labeled urea breath test (UBT), which is used to diagnose H. pylori infection. The test relies on the metabolism of urea by H. pylori, producing carbon dioxide that is enriched with Carbon 13, allowing for detection. This indicates a direct relationship where urea serves as a substrate for the test, and Carbon 13 is the isotopic label that enables the measurement of metabolic activity."
