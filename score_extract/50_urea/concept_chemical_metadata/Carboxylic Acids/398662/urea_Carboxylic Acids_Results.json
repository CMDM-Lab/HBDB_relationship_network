    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to carboxylic acids through the process of protein carbonylation and subsequent oxidation. Urea concentrations can lead to the formation of carbonyl groups on proteins, which may further oxidize to form carboxylic acids, such as glutamic acid. This indicates a biochemical pathway where urea influences the generation of carboxylic acids through oxidative processes, particularly in conditions of renal failure where urea levels are elevated."
