    "summary": "In this context, urea and carboxylic acids are related through their roles in the transport mechanism across the membrane in H. pylori. The protonation of histidine residues is suggested to facilitate hydrogen bonding with carboxylic acids, which may enable the transport of urea. This indicates a functional interaction between urea and carboxylic acids in the context of urease activation and membrane transport."
