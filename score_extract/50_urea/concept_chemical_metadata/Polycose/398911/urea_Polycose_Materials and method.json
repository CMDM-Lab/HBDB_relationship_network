    "summary": "In this context, urea and Polycose are connected through a diagnostic procedure involving the ingestion of 13C urea dissolved in a solution containing 15% Polycose. The Polycose serves as a vehicle for delivering the urea to the subjects, facilitating the measurement of 13C enrichment in breath samples to diagnose H. pylori infection. While they are used together in the procedure, their individual roles are distinct, with urea being the analyte of interest and Polycose acting as a carrier."
