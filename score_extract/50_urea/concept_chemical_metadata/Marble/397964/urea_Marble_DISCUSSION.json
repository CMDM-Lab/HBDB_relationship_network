    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its production and excretion in fish, specifically the marble goby. The study highlights the differences in urea production between fasted and fed states, with specific measurements provided. However, the term 'marble' appears only as part of the species name 'marble goby' and does not indicate a direct relationship with urea beyond its biological context. Thus, while both terms are related to the same biological study, their connection is not deeply explored."
