    "summary": "In this context, urea and fumarate are both products of the urea cycle, which is a series of biochemical reactions in the liver that convert ammonia and carbon dioxide into urea and other compounds. Specifically, fumarate is produced while aspartate is consumed during the cycle's operation. This indicates a direct metabolic relationship between urea and fumarate, highlighting their roles in nitrogen metabolism and amino acid synthesis."
