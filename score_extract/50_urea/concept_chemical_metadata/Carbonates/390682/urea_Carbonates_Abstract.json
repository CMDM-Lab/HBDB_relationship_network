    "summary": "In this context, urea and carbonates are mentioned as components in a method for isolating plasma membrane proteins from mouse brain tissue. Urea is used in the washing process to deplete nonmembrane molecules, while carbonates are also employed in the washing steps. Their relationship is primarily procedural, indicating that both are utilized in the same experimental protocol without a direct interaction or functional relationship discussed."
