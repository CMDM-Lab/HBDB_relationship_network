    "summary": "In this context, urea and amides are related through their chemical structure and functional roles in the modification of compounds affecting CB1 receptor activity. The conversion of an amide group to a urea in a compound resulted in decreased affinity for CB1 receptors, indicating that the presence of an amide or urea group can significantly influence the biological activity of these compounds. This suggests a direct relationship between the two terms in the context of drug design and receptor interaction."
