    "summary": "In this context, urea and amides are related through the discussion of novel arvanil derivatives, where the amide group is replaced with urea and thiourea moieties. This modification is evaluated for its impact on binding and activating cannabinoid receptors and inhibiting related enzymes. The relationship highlights the structural significance of urea in the context of amide functionality in drug design."
