    "summary": "In this context, urea is identified as an amide, and the ureI gene product is suggested to function as a urea transporter, potentially regulating urea permeability in prokaryotic membranes. The relationship is further supported by the mention of homologous amiS genes, which are known as amide transporters, indicating a functional connection between urea and amides in transport mechanisms."
