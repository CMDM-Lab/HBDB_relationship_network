    "summary": "In this context, urea and triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) are both used as components in the buffer solutions for protein elution and digestion processes. Urea serves to denature proteins, while TEAB is utilized in the iTRAQ labeling method for quantifying proteins. Their relationship is functional, as they are both critical for preparing samples for subsequent proteomic analysis, but they do not interact chemically or biologically beyond their roles in the experimental procedure."
