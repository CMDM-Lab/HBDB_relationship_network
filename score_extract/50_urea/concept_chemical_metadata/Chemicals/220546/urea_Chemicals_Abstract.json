    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a chemical agent used during the chemical denaturation transitions of BBL, indicating its role in influencing protein folding states. The study explores how urea, along with GdmCl, affects the distribution of protein states, highlighting its significance as a chemical in the context of protein chemistry and folding mechanisms. However, the term 'Chemicals' is broad and does not specify a direct relationship with urea beyond its classification as a chemical agent."
