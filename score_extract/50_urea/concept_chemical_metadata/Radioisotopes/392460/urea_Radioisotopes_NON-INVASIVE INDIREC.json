    "summary": "In this context, urea is related to radioisotopes through the use of isotopically labeled urea in breath tests for detecting H. pylori infection. The 14C-urea breath test utilizes a radioactive isotope of carbon (14C), while the 13C-urea breath test employs a non-radioactive isotope (13C). Both tests rely on the hydrolysis of urea by H. pylori, leading to the measurement of exhaled CO2. The mention of these tests highlights the application of radioisotopes in medical diagnostics involving urea."
