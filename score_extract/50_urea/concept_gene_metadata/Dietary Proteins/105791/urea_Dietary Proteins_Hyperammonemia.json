    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to dietary proteins through the metabolic processes that occur after protein consumption. Dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, which can lead to the production of ammonia. This ammonia is then converted into urea in the liver, a key step in the urea cycle. The mention of postprandial hyperammonemia suggests that disturbances in this cycle can occur due to protein intake, highlighting the importance of dietary proteins in urea synthesis and metabolism."
