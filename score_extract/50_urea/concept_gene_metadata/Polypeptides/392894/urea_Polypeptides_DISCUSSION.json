    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the extraction of transmembrane helices from the ribosome during protein synthesis, specifically regarding polypeptides like LacY. The study indicates that certain helices can be extracted with urea, suggesting a role of urea in the folding or stabilization of polypeptides during their translocation through the translocon. This highlights a functional relationship where urea influences the behavior of polypeptides in a membrane protein context."
