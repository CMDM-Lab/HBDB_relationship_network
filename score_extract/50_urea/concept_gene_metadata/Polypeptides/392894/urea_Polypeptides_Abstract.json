    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a reagent to extract polypeptides from the membrane during the study of lactose permease insertion. Specifically, the N-terminal six helices of the permease (N6) can be extracted with urea when still attached to the ribosome, indicating a relationship where urea facilitates the analysis of polypeptide conformation and membrane interaction. However, once N6 is released from the ribosome or additional helices are translated, it becomes resistant to urea extraction, highlighting a significant change in the polypeptide's structural state."
