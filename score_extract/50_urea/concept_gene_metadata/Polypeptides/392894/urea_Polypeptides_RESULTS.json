    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its ability to extract polypeptides from membranes during in vitro synthesis. The study indicates that certain polypeptides, particularly those associated with ribosomes, exhibit varying susceptibility to urea extraction, suggesting a relationship between urea's solubilizing properties and the structural state of polypeptides in a hydrophilic environment. The presence of urea influences the extraction of polypeptides, highlighting its role in protein solubility and membrane interactions."
