    "summary": "In this context, urea is used to dissociate a 44-kD polypeptide from tonoplast membranes during membrane fractionation experiments. The treatment with 8M urea facilitates the separation of the polypeptide from the membrane, indicating that urea plays a critical role in altering the interactions between polypeptides and membrane structures. This suggests a significant biochemical relationship where urea acts as a chaotropic agent affecting polypeptide behavior."
