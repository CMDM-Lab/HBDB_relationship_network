    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the OTC gene through the regulation of urea homeostasis by the transcription factor HNF4α. The study indicates that HNF4α directly regulates the OTC gene, which is crucial for the urea cycle, thereby highlighting the importance of this gene in maintaining proper urea levels in the body. This relationship underscores the role of genetic regulation in metabolic processes related to urea synthesis and excretion."
