    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to gene clusters through the study of the urease gene cluster in Helicobacter pylori, which is essential for the organism's survival in acidic environments. The gene cluster includes several genes (ureA, ureB, ureI, ureE, ureF, ureG, and ureH) that encode for the urease enzyme and its accessory components, highlighting the genetic basis for urea metabolism and its role in acid regulation. This relationship underscores the importance of these gene clusters in facilitating the enzymatic activity necessary for urea utilization."
