    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its impact on protein structure and activity. Unlike hypertonic substances like NaCl and raffinose, urea permeates cells and alters protein conformation, potentially leading to oxidative stress if these proteins are involved in oxidative reactions. This indicates a significant relationship between urea and protein structure, highlighting urea's role in modifying protein behavior under certain conditions."
