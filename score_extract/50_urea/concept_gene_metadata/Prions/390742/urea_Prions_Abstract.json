    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a destabilizing agent for proteins, while prions are implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation. The text discusses trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) as a counteracting osmolyte that can reverse the destabilizing effects of urea and interfere with the formation of scrapie prion proteins. This suggests a relationship where urea's destabilizing effects on proteins may contribute to prion formation, and TMAO's role is to mitigate these effects."
