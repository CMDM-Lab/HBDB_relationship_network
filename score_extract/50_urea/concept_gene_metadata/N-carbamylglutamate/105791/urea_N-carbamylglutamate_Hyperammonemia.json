    "summary": "In this context, urea and N-carbamylglutamate are related through their roles in the urea cycle and the management of hyperammonemia. N-carbamylglutamate acts as an activator of carbamoylphosphate synthetase-1, which is crucial for urea synthesis. The administration of N-carbamylglutamate is suggested to improve hyperammonemia associated with disrupted urea cycles, indicating a direct functional relationship between the two compounds in metabolic processes."
