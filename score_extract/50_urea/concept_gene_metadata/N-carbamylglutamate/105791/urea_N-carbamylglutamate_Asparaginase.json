    "summary": "In this context, urea and N-carbamylglutamate are related through their roles in the urea cycle, particularly in the treatment of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency. N-carbamylglutamate acts as a functional analog of N-acetylglutamate, activating carbamoylphosphate synthetase-1, which is crucial for urea production. This supplementation helps restore urea cycle function in patients with NAGS deficiency, highlighting a direct biochemical relationship between urea synthesis and N-carbamylglutamate's role in enhancing enzyme activity."
