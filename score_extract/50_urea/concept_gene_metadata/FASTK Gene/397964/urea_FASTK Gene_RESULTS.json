    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its appearance rates in mucosal saline under different feeding conditions and treatments, while the FASTK gene is not explicitly mentioned or linked to the urea metabolism or its rates. The context focuses on physiological responses rather than any genetic influence or relationship with the FASTK gene, indicating a lack of direct connection between the two terms."
