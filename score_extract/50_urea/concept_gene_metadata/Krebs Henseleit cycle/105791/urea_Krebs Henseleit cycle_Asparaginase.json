    "summary": "In this context, urea is a product of the Krebs-Henseleit cycle (also known as the urea cycle), which is a series of biochemical reactions in the liver that convert ammonia and bicarbonate into urea. The cycle involves the transformation of various amino acids, with urea and fumarate being generated as end-products. This highlights the critical role of the Krebs-Henseleit cycle in nitrogen metabolism and the detoxification of ammonia through urea formation."
