    "summary": "In this context, urea is involved in the denaturation process of the protein PAI-2, while the synthetic peptide plays a protective role against this denaturation. The study indicates that the presence of a 14-mer synthetic peptide enhances the stability of PAI-2 in the presence of urea, suggesting that the peptide induces a conformational change that makes PAI-2 more resistant to urea-induced denaturation. This highlights a significant interaction where the synthetic peptide mitigates the effects of urea on protein stability."
