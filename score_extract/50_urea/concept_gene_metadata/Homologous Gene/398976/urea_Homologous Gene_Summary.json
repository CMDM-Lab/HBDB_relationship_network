    "summary": "In this context, urea is related to the homologous gene through the study of the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which is a protein that facilitates urea transport. The tUT gene exhibits high homology with urea transporters from various species, indicating a conserved evolutionary function. This suggests that the gene encoding tUT plays a critical role in urea excretion in the toadfish, linking the biochemical process of urea transport to genetic expression."
