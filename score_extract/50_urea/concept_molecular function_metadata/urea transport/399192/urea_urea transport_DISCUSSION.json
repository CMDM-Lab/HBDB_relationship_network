    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to urea transport through the discussion of histidine residues and carboxylic acids that facilitate urea's movement across the membrane. The protonation of histidines is suggested to enable hydrogen bonding with carboxylic acids, which is crucial for effective urea transport. This indicates a direct biochemical relationship where the structure of specific amino acids influences the transport mechanism of urea."
