    "summary": "In this context, urea and urea transport are closely related as the study examines urea fluxes and transport mechanisms in tissues. The research involves analyzing urea production and transport under different conditions, indicating that urea transport is a critical process in understanding urea dynamics in the organism. The methodologies employed suggest a direct investigation into how urea is transported and its physiological implications."
