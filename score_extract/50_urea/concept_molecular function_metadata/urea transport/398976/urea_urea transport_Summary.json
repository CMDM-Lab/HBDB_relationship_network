    "summary": "In this context, urea and urea transport are closely related through the study of urea excretion mechanisms in toadfish. The expression of tUT mRNA in the gill indicates that this tissue is responsible for urea transport, confirming its role in regulating urea levels in the organism. The findings suggest that the regulation of urea transport is not primarily controlled at the mRNA level, highlighting the importance of urea transport in physiological processes."
