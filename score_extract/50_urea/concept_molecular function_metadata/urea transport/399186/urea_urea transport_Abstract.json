    "summary": "In this context, urea and urea transport are closely related through the function of the UreI transporter in Helicobacter pylori. Urea transport is essential for the bacterium to utilize urea for ammonia production, which helps buffer the acidic environment of the stomach. This mechanism is crucial for the survival and growth of H. pylori in gastric conditions, highlighting the direct dependence of urea transport on the presence of urea for effective acid survival."
