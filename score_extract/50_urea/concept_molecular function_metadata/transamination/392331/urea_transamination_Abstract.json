    "summary": "In this context, urea and transamination are related through the metabolic processes occurring in the liver. The study investigates the incorporation of nitrogen from amino acids and ammonia into urea, highlighting the role of transamination reactions in generating aspartate, which is subsequently utilized in urea synthesis. The results indicate that a significant portion of urea nitrogen originates from transaminated substrates, demonstrating the interconnectedness of these metabolic pathways."
