    "summary": "In this context, urea and transamination are connected through the metabolic pathway of amino acid catabolism. Transamination is the initial step where amino groups from amino acids are transferred to Î±-ketoglutarate, leading to the production of ammonia, which is subsequently processed in the urea cycle for elimination. This highlights the role of transamination in the formation of urea as a waste product of amino acid metabolism."
