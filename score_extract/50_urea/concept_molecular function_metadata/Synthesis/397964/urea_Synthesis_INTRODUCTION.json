    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its synthesis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of certain fish species, particularly in the context of detoxifying ammonia. The study hypothesizes that the gut tissue of the plainfin midshipman can convert ammonia to urea, suggesting a physiological role for the GI tract in urea synthesis and excretion. This indicates a significant relationship between urea and its synthesis process within the digestive system of these fish."
