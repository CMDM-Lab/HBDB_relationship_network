    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the process of synthesis, particularly in the liver where urea synthesis capacity is significantly reduced in cirrhotic patients. The study highlights that the synthesis of urea is impaired due to liver dysfunction, which affects the body's ability to clear ammonium. This indicates a critical relationship between urea and its synthesis, especially in the context of liver disease."
