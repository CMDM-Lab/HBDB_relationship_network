    "summary": "In this context, urea is synthesized through a series of biochemical processes involving ammonia and glutamine. The study highlights the contribution of perfusate ammonia and glutamine to urea-N output, indicating that these substrates play a crucial role in the synthesis of urea. The findings suggest that mitochondrial processes, including the formation of aspartate, are integral to urea synthesis, emphasizing the interconnectedness of nitrogen metabolism and urea production."
