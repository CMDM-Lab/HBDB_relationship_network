    "summary": "In this context, urea is synthesized from ammonia, glutamine, and arginine in the enterocytes of post-weaning pigs, as indicated by the increased activities of argininosuccinate synthase and arginase. This synthesis process is crucial for detoxifying ammonia, which can be toxic at high levels, thus highlighting the significance of urea synthesis in maintaining cellular health and function in these pigs."
