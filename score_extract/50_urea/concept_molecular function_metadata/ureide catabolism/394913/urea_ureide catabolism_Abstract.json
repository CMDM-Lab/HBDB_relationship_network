    "summary": "In this context, urea and ureide catabolism are related through the study of ureide degradation pathways in plants, particularly in soybean. The research indicates that ureide catabolism can occur without detectable urea production, suggesting that while urea may be involved in some metabolic processes, ureide degradation primarily relies on specific enzymes that do not release urea. This highlights a nuanced relationship where urea is not a direct product of ureide catabolism in certain conditions."
