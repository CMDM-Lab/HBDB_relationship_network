    "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen utilization are interconnected through the assessment of nitrogen absorption and retention in infants receiving different formulas. The study indicates that while urea balance increased with higher non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen intake, nitrogen retention decreased, suggesting a complex relationship where enhanced urea production does not equate to efficient nitrogen utilization. This highlights the role of urea in nitrogen metabolism and its implications for dietary formulations."
