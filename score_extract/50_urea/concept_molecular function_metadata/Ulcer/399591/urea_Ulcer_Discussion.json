    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the diagnosis of H. pylori infection, which is a significant cause of gastric ulcers. The urea breath test is highlighted as a noninvasive method for diagnosing H. pylori, allowing for effective monitoring of ulcer recurrence and treatment outcomes. This establishes a clear relationship between urea and ulcer pathology, as the presence of H. pylori is directly associated with ulcer development."
