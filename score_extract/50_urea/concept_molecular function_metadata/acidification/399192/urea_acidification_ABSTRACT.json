    "summary": "In this context, urea plays a crucial role in the acidification process of H. pylori. The addition of urea activates cytoplasmic urease, which hydrolyzes urea to produce ammonia (NH3). This reaction elevates the pH of the medium, counteracting the acidification that occurs in its absence. Consequently, the pH increase stabilizes the membrane potential and maintains the proton motive force (PMF) necessary for ATP synthesis in H. pylori."
