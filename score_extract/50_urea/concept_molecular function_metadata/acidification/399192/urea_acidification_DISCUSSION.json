    "summary": "In this context, urea and acidification are interconnected through the mechanism of urease activation in H. pylori. The acidification of the periplasmic space, caused by the influx of protons (H+), facilitates a conformational change in the UreI transporter, allowing urea to enter the cytoplasm. Once inside, urea is hydrolyzed, producing ammonia (NH3) that subsequently raises the pH, which is crucial for the survival and growth of the bacteria. This relationship highlights the importance of acidification in the metabolic process involving urea."
