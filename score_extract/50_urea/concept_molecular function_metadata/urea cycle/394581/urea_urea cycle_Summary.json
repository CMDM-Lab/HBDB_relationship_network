    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to the urea cycle, particularly in the detoxification of ammonia in mudskippers. The study highlights that while P. schlosseri has the enzymes necessary for the urea cycle, its functionality is compromised due to low enzyme activity, preventing effective ammonia detoxification. This indicates a direct relationship where urea is a product of the urea cycle, but the cycle's efficiency is limited in these species under specific conditions."
