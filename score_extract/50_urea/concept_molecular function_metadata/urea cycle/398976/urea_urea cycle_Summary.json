    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the urea cycle, which is a metabolic pathway responsible for the conversion of ammonia to urea for excretion. The study discusses urea transport mechanisms in toadfish, highlighting the role of tUT mRNA in urea permeability and excretion, which is integral to the urea cycle's function in nitrogen waste management. The findings emphasize the importance of urea in physiological processes linked to the urea cycle, particularly in aquatic organisms."
