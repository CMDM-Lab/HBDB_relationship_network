    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the urea cycle, which is a crucial metabolic pathway responsible for the conversion of ammonia to urea in the liver. The mention of the urea cycle indicates its role in processing nitrogenous waste, with specific enzymes involved in the cycle potentially affected by genetic variations (SNPs). The urea cycle's significance in metabolic processes highlights the importance of urea as a byproduct of this cycle, linking the two terms closely in the context of metabolic disorders."
