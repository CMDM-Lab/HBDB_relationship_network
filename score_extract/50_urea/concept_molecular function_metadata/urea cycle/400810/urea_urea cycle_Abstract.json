    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the urea cycle, as the study investigates the synthesis of urea from ammonia, glutamine, and arginine in enterocytes of pigs. The developmental changes in urea synthesis are linked to the activities of urea-cycle enzymes, indicating that the urea cycle is crucial for urea production, particularly in post-weaning pigs where enzyme activities are significantly altered. This highlights the importance of the urea cycle in the metabolic processing of nitrogenous waste in these animals."
