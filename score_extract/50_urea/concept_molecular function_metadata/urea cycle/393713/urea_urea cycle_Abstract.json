    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to the urea cycle, which is the metabolic pathway responsible for converting ammonia into urea. The urea cycle involves several enzymes, including carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), and is crucial for detoxifying ammonia produced from amino acid metabolism. The mention of OTC deficiency highlights the importance of the urea cycle in preventing hyperammonemia and related health issues, establishing a clear and critical relationship between urea and the urea cycle."
