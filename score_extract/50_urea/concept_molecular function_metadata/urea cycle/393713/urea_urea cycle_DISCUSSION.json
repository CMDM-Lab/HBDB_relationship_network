    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to the urea cycle through the discussion of OTC (ornithine transcarbamylase) deficiency, which is a condition affecting the urea cycle. The urea cycle is crucial for converting ammonia into urea for excretion, and deficiencies in its enzymes, like OTC, can lead to the accumulation of toxic substances. However, the specific relationship between urea and the urea cycle is not elaborated upon in detail."
