    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the urea cycle, which is a metabolic pathway that detoxifies ammonia into urea for excretion. The text discusses how certain fish species utilize the urea cycle (specifically the ornithine-urea cycle) to convert ammonia into urea, highlighting its significance in nitrogen metabolism and waste regulation. The presence of specific enzymes associated with the urea cycle in fish tissues indicates their reliance on this pathway for urea production, similar to mammals."
