    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to the urea cycle, as the study discusses the detoxification of ammonia to urea via the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC) in the intestinal tissue of the plainfin midshipman fish. The increase in urea excretion following feeding indicates the active role of the urea cycle in processing nitrogenous waste, highlighting its significance in nitrogen metabolism during digestion."
