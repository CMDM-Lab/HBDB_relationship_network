    "summary": "In this context, urea production is linked to arginase activity through the degradation of dietary arginine. The text suggests that arginase contributes to urea synthesis in teleost fish, particularly during post-prandial states. While the exact contribution of arginase to overall urea production is not fully quantified, it is indicated as a significant pathway alongside other enzymatic processes. This highlights a direct relationship between urea and arginase activity in the context of metabolic processes in fish."
