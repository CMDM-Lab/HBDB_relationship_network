    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to arginase activity through the urea cycle, where arginase-1 plays a crucial role in converting arginine to urea and ornithine. Deficiency in arginase-1 activity leads to congenital argininemia, resulting in impaired urea production and associated neurological symptoms. Thus, arginase activity is essential for proper urea metabolism."
