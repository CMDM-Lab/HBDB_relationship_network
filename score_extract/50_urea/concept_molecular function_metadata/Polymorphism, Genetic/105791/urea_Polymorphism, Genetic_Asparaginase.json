    "summary": "In this context, urea is produced as a result of the urea cycle, which involves several enzymatic reactions, including the conversion of arginine by arginase-1. The mention of genetic polymorphisms suggests that variations in genes related to the urea cycle may influence individual differences in urea metabolism. This indicates a potential link between genetic factors and urea cycle function, highlighting the role of genetic polymorphisms in affecting urea levels in individuals."
