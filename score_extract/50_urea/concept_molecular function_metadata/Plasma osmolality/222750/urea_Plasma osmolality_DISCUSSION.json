    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in enhancing the freezing survival and recovery of R. sylvatica. The study indicates that while urea levels were maintained during freezing and thawing, there was no evidence that urea loading altered plasma osmolality. This suggests that urea's protective effects during freezing are not directly linked to changes in plasma osmolality, indicating a more complex interaction where urea serves as a cryoprotectant without significantly affecting osmotic balance."
