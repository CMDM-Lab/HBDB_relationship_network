    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to evolutionary adaptations in mammals and birds. The text highlights that mammals have evolved mechanisms to manage urea levels due to its toxicity, while birds metabolize amino acids to uric acid instead of urea, indicating a significant evolutionary divergence in nitrogen waste management. This suggests that the presence and handling of urea have influenced evolutionary pressures in different species."
