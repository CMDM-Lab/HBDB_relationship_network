    "summary": "In this context, urea and cytochrome activity are both assessed as functional characteristics of ASGR1-positive hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). The study indicates that these cells are capable of performing mature hepatocyte functions, including urea secretion and cytochrome activity, suggesting a relationship where both are markers of hepatocyte functionality. However, the specific interaction between urea and cytochrome activity is not elaborated upon, indicating they are part of a broader assessment of liver cell function rather than directly influencing each other."
