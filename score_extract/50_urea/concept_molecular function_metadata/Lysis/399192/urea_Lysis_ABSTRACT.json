    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to lysis through the study of the UreI protein in Helicobacter pylori. The research investigates urease activity in both intact and lysed bacteria, suggesting that urea may influence membrane potential and bacterial survival during lysis. However, the direct relationship between urea and lysis is not explicitly detailed."
