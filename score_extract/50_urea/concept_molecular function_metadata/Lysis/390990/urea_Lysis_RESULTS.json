    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a component in the extraction process of membrane-associated glycoconjugates from osmotically lysed T. brucei cells. The lysis of the cells allows for the solubilization of proteins, and urea plays a role in denaturing proteins to facilitate their extraction. However, the specific relationship between urea and the lysis process is not deeply explored beyond its use in the methodology."
