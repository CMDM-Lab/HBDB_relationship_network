    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to its role in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and its interaction with high NaCl levels, which may induce reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the term 'Pressure- physical agent' is not explicitly connected to urea or its effects. The discussion primarily revolves around the biochemical implications of urea and NaCl without a clear link to physical pressure as a factor influencing these processes."
