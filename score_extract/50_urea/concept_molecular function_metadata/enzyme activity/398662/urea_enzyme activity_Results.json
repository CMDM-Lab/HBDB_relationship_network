    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its effects on enzyme activity and protein denaturation. It is noted that high concentrations of urea can directly affect enzyme activity and lead to protein carbonylation, particularly in conditions of renal failure where urea levels are elevated. The study suggests a potential chemical effect of urea on cellular proteins, indicating a significant relationship between urea concentration and enzyme function."
