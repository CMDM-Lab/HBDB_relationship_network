    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to have a significant impact on enzyme activity, particularly in the renal inner medulla cells (mIMCD3). High concentrations of urea can denature proteins and affect enzyme activity in vitro, indicating that urea not only influences cellular function but also modulates signaling pathways that regulate enzyme activity. The activation of mitogenic signaling proteins and the transcription of immediate-early genes in response to urea further highlight its role in altering enzyme activity and cellular responses in uremic conditions."
