    "summary": "In this context, urea is produced through various enzymatic pathways, including the degradation of dietary arginine by arginase and uricolysis associated with purine nucleotide metabolism. The relationship between urea and enzyme activity is highlighted by the mention of intestinal arginase activity and its suspected contribution to urea synthesis in fish. However, the context notes that while urea excretion rates increased in fed tilapia, uricolytic enzyme activities in the liver were unchanged or decreased, indicating a complex interaction that warrants further investigation."
