    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed as a destabilizing agent that negatively impacts protein stability and enzyme activity. The presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is highlighted for its ability to counteract the destabilizing effects of urea, thereby restoring enzyme activity that is lost due to urea treatment. This indicates a direct relationship where urea's effects on enzyme activity can be mitigated by TMAO."
