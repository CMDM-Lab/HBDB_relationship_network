    "summary": "In this context, urea and nitrogen retention are interconnected through the assessment of nitrogen utilization efficiency in infants receiving different formulas. While the apparent urea balance increased with higher non-protein nitrogen and urea nitrogen intake, nitrogen retention was significantly depressed, indicating that despite enhanced urea salvage, the efficiency of nitrogen utilization was compromised. This suggests a complex relationship where increased urea levels do not necessarily correlate with improved nitrogen retention."
