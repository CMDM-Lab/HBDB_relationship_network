    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to respiratory alkalosis through the discussion of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency, a urea cycle disorder. Patients with ASL deficiency experience hyperammonemia and respiratory alkalosis, which are common clinical features of urea cycle defects. The accumulation of argininosuccinate and reduced arginine synthesis may contribute to these symptoms, linking urea metabolism to respiratory alkalosis in affected individuals."
