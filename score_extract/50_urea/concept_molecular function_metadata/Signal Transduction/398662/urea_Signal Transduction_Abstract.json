    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to initiate signaling events characteristic of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, indicating its role in signal transduction. High levels of urea not only activate transcription of immediate-early genes like Egr-1 but also induce oxidative stress in renal cells, which further influences signaling cascades. This suggests a significant relationship between urea and signal transduction mechanisms, particularly in the context of renal function and cellular stress responses."
