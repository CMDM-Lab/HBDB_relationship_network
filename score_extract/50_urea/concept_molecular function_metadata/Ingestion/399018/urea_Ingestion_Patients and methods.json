    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to ingestion as it is administered to patients in a modified urea breath test (UBT) protocol. Patients ingest 100 mg of 13C-labeled urea mixed with a fatty test meal to facilitate gastric emptying. The subsequent analysis of expired gas samples measures the metabolic response to the ingested urea, indicating its role in diagnosing H. pylori infection through rapid hydrolysis and CO2 production."
