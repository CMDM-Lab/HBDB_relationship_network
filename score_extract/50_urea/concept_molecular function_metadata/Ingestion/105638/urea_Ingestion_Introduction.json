    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to ingestion through the study of 13C-labeled glycosyl ureides as markers for measuring orocecal transit time. The ingestion of these labeled compounds leads to the formation of labeled metabolites, which are then detected in exhaled breath. This process highlights the role of bacterial enzymes in metabolizing the ingested glycosyl ureide, which contains a urea moiety, but does not establish a direct functional relationship between urea itself and the act of ingestion."
