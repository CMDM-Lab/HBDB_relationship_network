    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to cerebral edema through the discussion of hyperammonemia, which can result from a disrupted urea cycle. Conditions like Reye's syndrome and urinary tract infections with urease-producing organisms lead to increased ammonia levels, contributing to cerebral edema. The relationship highlights the potential impact of urea metabolism on neurological conditions characterized by cerebral edema."
