    "summary": "In this context, urea is produced through three distinct enzymatic pathways, including the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC), which is energetically costly. The presence of specific enzymes such as glutamine synthetase, carbamoyl phosphate synthase III, and ornithine carbamoyltransferase in fish tissues indicates their ability to detoxify ammonia into urea. This highlights a direct relationship between urea and the enzyme pathways involved in its synthesis, particularly in ureotelic fish, which utilize these pathways for nitrogen metabolism."
