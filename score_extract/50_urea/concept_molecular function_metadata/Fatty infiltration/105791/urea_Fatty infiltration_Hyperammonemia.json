    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to fatty infiltration through the discussion of Reye's syndrome, which is characterized by diffuse fatty infiltration of the viscera and is associated with hyperammonemia. The urea cycle's disruption, leading to hyperammonemia, may contribute to the metabolic disturbances seen in conditions like Reye's syndrome, where fatty infiltration occurs. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and urea is not directly linked to fatty infiltration outside of this context."
