    "summary": "In this context, urea and fatty acid oxidation are related through the metabolic consequences of disrupted fatty acid oxidation, particularly in conditions like medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. The accumulation of unoxidized fatty acyl-CoA metabolites inhibits the urea cycle, leading to hyperammonemia. This indicates that impaired fatty acid oxidation can directly affect urea metabolism, highlighting a critical metabolic interaction between these two processes."
