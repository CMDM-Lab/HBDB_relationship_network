    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a factor that decreases the phosphorylation of GDPD5 at the T587 site. The study indicates that high concentrations of urea, along with high NaCl, negatively impact the phosphorylation status of GDPD5, which in turn affects its enzymatic activity. This suggests a direct relationship where urea influences the phosphorylation process, thereby modulating the activity of GDPD5."
