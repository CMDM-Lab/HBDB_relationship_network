    "summary": "In this context, urea plays a crucial role in maintaining membrane potentials in H. pylori by influencing the proton motive force (PMF). The addition of urea activates cytoplasmic urease, which increases the pH and stabilizes the membrane potential at approximately -101 mV. This adjustment is essential for sustaining the PMF, particularly when medium acidification occurs in the absence of urea, which would otherwise decrease the membrane potential."
