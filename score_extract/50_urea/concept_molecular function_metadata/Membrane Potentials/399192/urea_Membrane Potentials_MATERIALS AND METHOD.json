    "summary": "In this context, urea is introduced as a component added to a system to observe its effect on fluorescence quenching, which is linked to membrane potentials. The experiment measures changes in fluorescence after adding urea, indicating its role in influencing the membrane potential of the bacteria. However, the specific interaction between urea and membrane potentials is not elaborated upon, focusing instead on the measurement techniques and calibration methods used in the study."
