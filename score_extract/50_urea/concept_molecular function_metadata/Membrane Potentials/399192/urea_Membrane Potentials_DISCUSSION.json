    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to membrane potentials through its role in activating cytoplasmic urease in Helicobacter species. The addition of urea at acidic pH resulted in an increase in membrane potential in H. mustelae, suggesting a functional relationship between urea and membrane dynamics. However, this effect was not observed in nongastric Helicobacter species, indicating a specific interaction in certain contexts."
