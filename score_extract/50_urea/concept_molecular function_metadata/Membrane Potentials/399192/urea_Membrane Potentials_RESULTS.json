    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to influence the membrane potential of various Helicobacter species, specifically increasing the membrane potential in H. pylori, H. mustelae, and H. nemestrinae. This suggests a direct relationship where urea acts as a modulator of membrane potential, affecting the physiological state of these bacteria. However, no effect was observed in other Helicobacter species, indicating a selective interaction."
