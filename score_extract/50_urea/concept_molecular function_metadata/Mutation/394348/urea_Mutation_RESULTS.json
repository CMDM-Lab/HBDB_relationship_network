    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the denaturation of PAI-2, particularly in experiments involving mutated RCL peptides. The mutations at specific residues (P13 and P14) affect the peptide's ability to resist denaturation by urea, indicating a relationship between the structural changes due to mutation and the stability of PAI-2 in the presence of urea. However, the context does not provide a direct link between urea and mutation beyond this experimental observation."
