    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to mutations through the discussion of arginase-1 gene mutations that lead to argininemia, a urea cycle disorder. The deficiency in arginase-1 activity due to these mutations results in impaired urea production, causing metabolic disturbances and neurological issues in affected individuals. Thus, mutations in the arginase-1 gene have a direct impact on urea metabolism."
