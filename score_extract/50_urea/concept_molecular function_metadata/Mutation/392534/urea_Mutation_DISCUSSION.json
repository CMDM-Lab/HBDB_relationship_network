    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to the mutation discussed, specifically the N109A mutation in the Runt domain. The mutation affects the structural stability and binding affinity of the Runt domain to CBFÎ², which may influence urea metabolism indirectly through altered protein function. However, urea itself is not directly mentioned as being affected by the mutation, nor is there a clear biochemical link established between them in the provided context."
