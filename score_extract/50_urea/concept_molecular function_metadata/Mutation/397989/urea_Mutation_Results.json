    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the effects of high NaCl and high urea on the activity of GDPD5 mutants. The study indicates that mutations in the GDPD5 protein can influence its activity, and the presence of high urea inhibits the activity of a specific triple mutant. This suggests a potential interaction between urea levels and the functional consequences of mutations in GDPD5, although the exact nature of this relationship is not fully elucidated."
