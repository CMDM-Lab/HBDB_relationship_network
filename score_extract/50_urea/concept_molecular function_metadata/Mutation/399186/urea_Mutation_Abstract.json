    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to mutation through the study of the UreI protein, which is involved in urea transport in prokaryotes. A specific mutation of histidine 123 to arginine or glycine was investigated, revealing that while the expression of UreI remained unchanged, the mutation affected the acid activation of urea uptake. This indicates that the mutation has functional implications for urea transport, although urea itself is not directly discussed as being affected by the mutation."
