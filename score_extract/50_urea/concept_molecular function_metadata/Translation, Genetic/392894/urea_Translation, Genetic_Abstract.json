    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the extraction of the N-terminal six helices of the lactose permease protein from the membrane. The ability to extract these helices with urea indicates a specific interaction during the translation process, suggesting that urea plays a role in the conformational changes of the protein as it is synthesized and inserted into the membrane. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the extraction process rather than a direct link to genetic translation mechanisms."
