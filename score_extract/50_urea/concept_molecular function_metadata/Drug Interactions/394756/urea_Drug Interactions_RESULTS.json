    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its effect on the binding of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to tubulin subunits. The presence of urea significantly reduces the binding affinity of MAP2 and MAP1A to tubulin, indicating that urea acts as a chaotropic agent affecting protein interactions. However, there is no direct mention of drug interactions, making the relationship between urea and drug interactions unclear and indirect."
