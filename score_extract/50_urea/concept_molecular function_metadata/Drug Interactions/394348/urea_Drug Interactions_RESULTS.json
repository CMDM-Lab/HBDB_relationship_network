    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in denaturation experiments involving PAI-2 and various RCL peptides. However, there is no direct mention of drug interactions or how urea might influence them. The focus is primarily on the structural effects of urea on proteins rather than any pharmacological implications or interactions with drugs."
