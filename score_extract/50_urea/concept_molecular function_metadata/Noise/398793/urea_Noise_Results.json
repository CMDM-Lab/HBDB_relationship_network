    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the study of protein conformational fluctuations and their effects on signal measurements. The noise referred to is likely related to shot noise and fluctuations in the signal caused by the conformational changes of the protein in varying urea concentrations. However, the relationship between urea and noise is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more indirect connection."
