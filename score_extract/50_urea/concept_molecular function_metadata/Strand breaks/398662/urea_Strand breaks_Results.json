    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to induce single-strand DNA breaks in isolated nuclei, as evidenced by increased DNA breaks when cells are exposed to high urea concentrations. The study highlights that urea causes oxidative lesions in DNA, leading to significant damage, while high NaCl does not produce similar effects. This establishes a clear and direct relationship between urea and the occurrence of strand breaks in DNA."
