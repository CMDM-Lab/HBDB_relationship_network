    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to significantly impact isomerase activity, specifically that of RCH. The study indicates that incubation with urea leads to a marked decline in isomerase activity, with reductions of approximately 50% and 75% after 20 and 40 minutes, respectively, at 37Â°C. This suggests that urea acts as a potent denaturant, affecting the catalytic function of the isomerase enzyme, while having no significant effect on GSH-catalyzed reactions within the same timeframe."
