    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to its transport mechanism via the inner membrane protein UreI, which facilitates urea uptake in prokaryotes like Helicobacter pylori. The activation of UreI for urea transport is influenced by the protonation state of specific histidine residues, indicating that pH levels play a crucial role in regulating urea uptake. The study highlights the importance of maintaining appropriate pH levels for effective urea transport, which is vital for the survival of these organisms in acidic environments."
