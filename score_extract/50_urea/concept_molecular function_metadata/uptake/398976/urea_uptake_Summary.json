    "summary": "In this context, urea and uptake are directly related through the function of the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which significantly enhances urea permeability in Xenopus laevis oocytes, increasing [(14)C]urea uptake by five- to sevenfold. This indicates that tUT facilitates the uptake of urea, demonstrating a clear and critical relationship between the transporter and urea transport mechanisms in the gill of the toadfish."
