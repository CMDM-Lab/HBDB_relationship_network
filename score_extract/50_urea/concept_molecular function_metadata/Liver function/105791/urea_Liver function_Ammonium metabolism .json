    "summary": "In this context, urea is closely related to liver function through the urea cycle, where ammonia is converted into urea in hepatocytes. The liver's ability to synthesize urea is indicative of its functional capacity, as evidenced by the increased urea synthesis following liver resections. This highlights the liver's critical role in detoxifying ammonia and maintaining metabolic homeostasis."
