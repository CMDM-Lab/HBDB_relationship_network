    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to liver function through the urea cycle, which is a critical pathway for detoxifying ammonia produced from amino acid metabolism. The study highlights that liver-specific HNF4Î±-null mice exhibit significantly altered serum levels of ammonia and urea, indicating impaired liver function. Elevated ammonia levels and reduced urea production in these mice suggest a compromised urea cycle, underscoring the liver's essential role in maintaining nitrogen balance and detoxification."
