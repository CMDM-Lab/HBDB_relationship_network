    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in protein unfolding, specifically the unfolding of sAPPÎ±. The text compares the unfolding effects of urea and GdnHCl, suggesting that the ionic force associated with GdnHCl contributes to its stronger unfolding capability compared to urea. While urea is a neutral molecule, the concept of 'force' here relates to the ionic strength effect that influences protein stability and unfolding dynamics, indicating a connection between urea and the forces at play in protein chemistry."
