    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed as a response to osmotic challenges faced by amphibians during winter hibernation, where low temperatures lead to diminished renal function. This results in urea retention, contributing to hyperuremia in frogs. The relationship highlights how renal function affects urea levels in response to environmental stressors."
