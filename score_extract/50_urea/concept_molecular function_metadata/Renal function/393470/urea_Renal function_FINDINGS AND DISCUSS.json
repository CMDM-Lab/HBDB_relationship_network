    "summary": "In this context, urea concentration is linked to renal function, particularly in the setting of reduced renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, which can occur after prolonged strenuous exercise (PSE). An increase in urea levels may indicate renal stress or damage, although transient elevations post-exercise are generally not clinically concerning. However, there are indications that repeated endurance events could potentially lead to renal alterations, suggesting a complex relationship between urea levels and renal health."
