    "summary": "In this context, urea and glutamate-ammonia ligase activity are related through the detoxification process of ammonia in the intestinal tissue of the plainfin midshipman fish. The study indicates that ammonia, produced during digestion, is converted to urea via the ornithine-urea cycle, which involves enzymes like glutamate-ammonia ligase. The increase in urea excretion post-feeding suggests that the activity of enzymes involved in this metabolic pathway, including glutamate-ammonia ligase, is crucial for managing ammonia levels and synthesizing urea in response to dietary intake."
