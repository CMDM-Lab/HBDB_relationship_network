    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its inhibitory effect on the swarming of P. mirabilis, suggesting its potential role in promoting sterility in culture media. The addition of sterile urea to blood agar base is shown to reduce the growth of P. mirabilis, indicating that urea can help isolate specific bacterial colonies by limiting overgrowth. This suggests a functional relationship where urea contributes to maintaining sterility in mixed cultures by inhibiting certain bacterial growth."
