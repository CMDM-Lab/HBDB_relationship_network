    "summary": "In this context, urea and arginine catabolism are linked through the metabolic pathways fish utilize for nitrogen waste regulation. Urea is produced as a less toxic form of nitrogen waste, primarily through arginine catabolism and the ornithine-urea cycle (O-UC). This indicates that arginine catabolism is a critical step in the conversion of ammonia to urea, highlighting its importance in the ureotelic strategy of nitrogen excretion in certain fish species."
