    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to the excretory function as it is produced from the detoxification of ammonia during digestion in the plainfin midshipman fish. The study highlights that increased urea excretion occurs as a result of the intestinal detoxification process, indicating that urea plays a crucial role in the excretory function of this species, particularly following feeding. The involvement of the ornithine-urea cycle in converting ammonia to urea further emphasizes this relationship."
