    "summary": "In this context, urea is closely linked to the excretory function as it is produced from the detoxification of excess ammonia during digestion in fish. The study discusses how urea is excreted back into the intestinal lumen and partially utilized by ureolytic bacteria, indicating its role in nitrogen waste management and the overall excretory process in aquatic organisms. The increase in urea excretion following feeding highlights its significance in the excretory function."
