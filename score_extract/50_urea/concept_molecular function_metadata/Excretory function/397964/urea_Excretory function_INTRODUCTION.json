    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in the excretory function of certain fish species, particularly in the detoxification of ammonia in the gastrointestinal tract. The study suggests that urea synthesis may occur in the gut, allowing for the transport and excretion of urea, indicating a significant relationship between urea and the excretory function in these organisms. This highlights the physiological importance of urea in nitrogen excretion processes."
