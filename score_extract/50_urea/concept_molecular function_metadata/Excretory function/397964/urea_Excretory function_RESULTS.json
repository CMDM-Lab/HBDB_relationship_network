    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the excretory function as it is a key nitrogenous waste product excreted by animals, including the plainfin midshipman. The study measures urea excretion rates, indicating the efficiency of the excretory function in eliminating nitrogenous waste during digestion. The data suggests that urea plays a significant role in the overall nitrogen excretion process."
