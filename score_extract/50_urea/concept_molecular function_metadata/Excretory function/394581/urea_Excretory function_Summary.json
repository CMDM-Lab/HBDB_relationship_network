    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to the excretory function of mudskippers during aerial exposure. The study highlights that while ammonia excretion rates decreased, there was a significant increase in urea levels in the liver of one species, Periophthalmodon schlosseri. This suggests that urea plays a role in the excretory function, particularly in the detoxification of ammonia, although the complete ornithine-urea cycle was not functional in the other species, Boleophthalmus boddaerti."
