    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the excretory function as it is measured through the excretion of [(14)C]urea into the water by toadfish. The study highlights the role of gill mRNA in urea transport, indicating that the gill is a key site for urea excretion. This suggests that urea plays a critical role in the excretory processes of the toadfish, particularly in relation to its regulation and transport mechanisms."
