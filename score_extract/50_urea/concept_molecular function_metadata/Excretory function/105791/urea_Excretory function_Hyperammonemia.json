    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to the excretory function as it is a key waste product formed in the urea cycle, which is crucial for the removal of excess nitrogen from the body. The discussion of hyperammonemia highlights the importance of proper excretory function in maintaining nitrogen balance and preventing toxic accumulation, suggesting that urea levels can reflect the efficiency of the excretory system, particularly in conditions like liver disease and metabolic disorders."
