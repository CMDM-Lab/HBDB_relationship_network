    "summary": "In this context, urea is highlighted as a key component in establishing the corticopapillary osmotic gradient necessary for water excretion in the kidneys. The accumulation of urea, along with NaCl, contributes to the osmotic gradient that regulates water permeability and excretion, indicating its critical role in the excretory function of the renal system. The relationship is underscored by the physiological processes that depend on urea for effective water management in the body."
