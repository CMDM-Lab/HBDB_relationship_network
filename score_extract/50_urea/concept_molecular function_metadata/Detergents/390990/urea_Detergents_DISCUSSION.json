    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a solubilizing agent in combination with detergents (specifically 3% SDS) to extract high molecular mass glycoproteins from cell ghosts. The study indicates that urea enhances the extraction process, suggesting a synergistic relationship where urea improves the effectiveness of detergents in solubilizing complex protein structures, which may not be achieved by detergents alone."
