    "summary": "In this context, urea and detergents are related through the investigation of urease activity in Helicobacter species. The study examines how the nonionic detergent C12E8 permeabilizes cells to allow urea access to the cytoplasm, which is essential for urease activity. This suggests that detergents can influence the availability of urea for enzymatic reactions, highlighting a functional relationship between the two."
