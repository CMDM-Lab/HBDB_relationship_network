    "summary": "In this context, urea and detergents are mentioned in relation to the structural stability of the peptide PrP (109–141). Urea is noted for maintaining a stable random-coil structure in high concentrations, while detergents facilitate the formation of a stable α-helical structure in mixed solvents. This indicates that both substances influence the peptide's conformation, but their specific roles and interactions are not deeply explored."
