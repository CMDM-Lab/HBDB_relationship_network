    "summary": "In this context, urea and detergents are related through the study of urease activity in Helicobacter pylori. The detergent C12E8 was shown to fully activate urease in ureI mutant cells, indicating that detergents can influence the pH dependence of urease activity by facilitating urea transport. This suggests a significant interaction where detergents enhance the functional capacity of urease in the absence of the UreI transporter."
