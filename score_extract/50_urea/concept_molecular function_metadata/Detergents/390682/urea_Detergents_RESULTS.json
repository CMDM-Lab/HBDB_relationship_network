    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as part of a crude membrane preparation process involving high salt and high pH conditions, while detergents, specifically digitonin, are used to treat these membranes for separation purposes. However, there is no direct discussion of how urea interacts with detergents or their combined effects on membrane properties, indicating a lack of a significant relationship between the two terms."
