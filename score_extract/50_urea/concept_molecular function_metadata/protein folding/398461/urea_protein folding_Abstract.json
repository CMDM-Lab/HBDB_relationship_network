    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized as a tool to investigate the protein folding dynamics of SOD1, particularly in relation to its aggregation process. The study employs urea titration to assess how the presence of urea influences the lag time and growth rate of fibrillation, indicating its role in modulating the folding equilibrium of the protein. This suggests a significant relationship between urea and the mechanisms of protein folding and aggregation, particularly in the context of understanding SOD1's behavior under physiological conditions."
