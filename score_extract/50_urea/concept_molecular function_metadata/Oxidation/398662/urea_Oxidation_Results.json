    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to oxidation through its role in protein carbonylation in mIMCD3 cells. The study indicates that urea concentrations can lead to the carbonylation of proteins, with higher concentrations potentially increasing oxidation levels. This suggests that urea not only contributes to protein modification but also interacts with oxidative processes, particularly in conditions like renal failure where urea levels are elevated."
