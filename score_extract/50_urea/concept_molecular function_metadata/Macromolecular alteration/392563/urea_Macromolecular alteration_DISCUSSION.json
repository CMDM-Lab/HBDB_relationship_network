    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its effects on the conformational changes of the protein sAPPα. The presence of urea does not lead to an increase in bis-ANS binding, indicating that macromolecular alterations in sAPPα's structure do not occur uniformly with increasing urea concentrations. The unfolding process of sAPPα is described as non-cooperative, suggesting that urea induces complex macromolecular alterations rather than a simple transition, highlighting its role in protein denaturation."
