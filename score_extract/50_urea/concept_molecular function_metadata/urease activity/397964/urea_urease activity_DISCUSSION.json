    "summary": "In this context, urea and urease activity are related through the metabolic processes of bacteria in the intestines of fish. The study indicates that urease activity remains constant regardless of the feeding state, as both fed and unfed fish show similar proportions of urea consumption. This suggests that urease plays a crucial role in the utilization of urea produced by the host, contributing to nitrogen metabolism and energy salvage."
