    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a substrate in the 13C-urea breath test to assess urease activity, particularly in relation to H. pylori infection. The test measures the conversion of urea to carbon dioxide by urease, which is produced by H. pylori. An increase in the Î´ value of CO2 in breath samples indicates urease activity, confirming the presence of H. pylori. Thus, urea and urease activity are directly related through this diagnostic method."
