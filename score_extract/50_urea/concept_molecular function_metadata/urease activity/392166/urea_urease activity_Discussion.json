    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to urease activity as the latter is responsible for the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, which is a key reaction in the detection of H. pylori infection. The study discusses the measurement of urease activity in the stomach and its implications for confirming H. pylori eradication, highlighting the importance of urease in the metabolism of urea in the gastrointestinal tract. The relationship is significant as urease activity directly influences the results of breath tests used to diagnose H. pylori infection."
