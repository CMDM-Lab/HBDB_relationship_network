    "summary": "In this context, urea and urease activity are closely related through the 13C-urea breath test, which measures urease activity in the stomach as an indicator of H. pylori infection. The test's results are directly influenced by the total urease activity, which reflects the density of H. pylori colonization. This relationship is significant as it helps assess the effectiveness of eradication therapies based on urease activity levels."
