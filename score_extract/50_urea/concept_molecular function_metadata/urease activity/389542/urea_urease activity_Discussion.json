    "summary": "In this context, urea and urease activity are related through the 13C-urea breath test, which is used to estimate H. pylori infection levels by measuring urease activity in the stomach. However, the study highlights significant limitations in accurately correlating urease activity with bacterial density, indicating that while urea serves as a substrate for urease, the relationship is complicated by variability in individual responses and bacterial strain differences."
