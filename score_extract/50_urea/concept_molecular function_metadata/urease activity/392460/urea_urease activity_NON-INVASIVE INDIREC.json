    "summary": "In this context, urea and urease activity are directly related through the urea breath test for detecting H. pylori infection. Urease, produced by H. pylori, catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The presence of urease activity indicates the breakdown of urea, which is essential for the test's diagnostic purpose, highlighting the functional relationship between the two."
