    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to urease activity as it serves as a substrate for the enzyme urease, which is crucial for the survival of Helicobacter pylori in acidic environments. The study investigates how urea influences urease activity and membrane potential in various Helicobacter species, highlighting the importance of urease in the bacterium's acid survival mechanism. The presence of UreI protein enhances urease activity in acidic conditions, indicating a significant functional relationship between urea and urease activity."
