    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to urease activity, as the study investigates how the addition of urea influences the activity of urease in Helicobacter pylori. The presence of 5 mM urea is shown to enhance urease activity, which is measured by the amount of CO2 liberated, indicating a clear functional relationship between urea and urease activity in the experimental setup."
