    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its elevated concentrations following strenuous exercise, which may indicate increased protein catabolism. This suggests a connection between urea levels and protein turnover, as higher protein breakdown during intense physical activity can lead to increased urea production as a waste product. The transient rise in urea concentration reflects the metabolic processes associated with protein turnover, particularly in athletes under stress from training."
