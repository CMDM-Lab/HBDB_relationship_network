    "summary": "In this context, urea is closely related to protein turnover as it serves as a marker for protein catabolism. The normalized protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance (nPNA) and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) are derived from urea measurements, indicating the rate of protein breakdown in patients undergoing dialysis. This highlights the importance of urea in assessing protein metabolism and turnover in clinical settings."
