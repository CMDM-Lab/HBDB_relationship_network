    "summary": "In this context, urea is described as a metabolic inhibitor that reduces the energetic cost of overwintering in terrestrially hibernating frogs. It is suggested that urea's accumulation during autumn serves multiple functions, including acting as an osmoprotectant and potentially enhancing survival during freezing episodes. The term 'inhibitors' relates to urea's role in metabolic processes, indicating its function in reducing metabolic activity during hibernation, although specific inhibitors are not detailed."
