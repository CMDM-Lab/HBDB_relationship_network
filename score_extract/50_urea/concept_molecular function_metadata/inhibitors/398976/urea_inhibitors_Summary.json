    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to inhibitors through the study of the toadfish urea transporter (tUT), which facilitates urea excretion. The research indicates that the increased urea permeability in Xenopus laevis oocytes, due to tUT expression, is inhibited by phloretin, a known inhibitor of urea transporters. This highlights the role of inhibitors in modulating urea transport activity."
