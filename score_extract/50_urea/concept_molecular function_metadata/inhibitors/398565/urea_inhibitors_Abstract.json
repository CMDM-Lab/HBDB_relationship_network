    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as part of a piperidine-urea compound identified through high-throughput screening (HTS) as a potential inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The study highlights the discovery and characterization of various FAAH inhibitors, including those with urea moieties, indicating a direct relationship where urea contributes to the inhibitory activity of these compounds. However, the specific role of urea in the mechanism of inhibition is not elaborated upon in detail."
