    "summary": "In this context, urea is involved as a key component in the mechanism of action of compound 1, which acts as a suicide substrate inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The urea carbonyl is specifically targeted and acylated by the catalytic nucleophile Ser241, indicating a direct relationship between urea and the inhibitory action of the compound. This highlights the role of urea in the design of inhibitors that interact with the enzyme's active site, showcasing its significance in the context of enzyme inhibition."
