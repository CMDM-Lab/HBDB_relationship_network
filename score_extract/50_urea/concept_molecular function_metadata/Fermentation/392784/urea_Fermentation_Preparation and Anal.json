    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its preparation and properties, with a mention of its decomposition upon boiling, which produces ammonia and other compounds. The text speculates that ammonia-containing calculi may form from the partial fermentation of urea in the bladder. However, the relationship between urea and fermentation is not extensively detailed, indicating a more indirect connection rather than a direct interaction."
