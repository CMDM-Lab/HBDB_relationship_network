    "summary": "In this context, urea is shown to activate signaling pathways in mouse renal inner medullary cells, leading to increased transcription and protein expression of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153). This suggests that high urea levels not only initiate signaling cascades but also influence protein expression related to oxidative stress and cellular damage, indicating a significant relationship between urea and protein expression in renal cells under stress conditions."
