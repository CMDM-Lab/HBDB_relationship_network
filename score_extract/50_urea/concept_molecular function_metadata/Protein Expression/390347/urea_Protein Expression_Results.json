    "summary": "In this context, urea is examined for its effect on AQP2 protein expression in mpkCCDcl4 cells under hyperosmotic conditions. The study shows that the addition of urea decreases AQP2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner, similar to the effects observed with sucrose. This indicates that urea influences protein expression related to osmotic challenges, although it does not induce the same hypertonicity-dependent response as sucrose."
