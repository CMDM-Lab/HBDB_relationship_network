    "summary": "In this context, urea is examined in relation to its hyperosmotic effects on AQP2 expression. The study shows that hyperosmotic challenge with urea leads to a decrease in AQP2 protein and mRNA levels, indicating that urea does not induce a typical hypertonicity-dependent response like sucrose does. This suggests a distinct role for urea in modulating cellular responses to hyperosmotic conditions."
