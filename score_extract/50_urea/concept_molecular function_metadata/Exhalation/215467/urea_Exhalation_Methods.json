    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to exhalation through the urea breath test used to detect H. pylori infection. Participants exhaled into foil balloons before and after consuming a 13C-labelled urea solution. The analysis of breath samples measured changes in urea levels, indicating the presence of H. pylori based on the exhaled carbon dioxide enriched with 13C. This demonstrates a clear physiological connection between urea metabolism and the process of exhalation in diagnostic testing."
