    "summary": "In this context, urea is administered to the patient in a solution, and the subsequent exhalation of breath is analyzed to assess the presence of urea in the exhaled samples. The procedure involves collecting breath samples after urea ingestion, indicating a direct relationship where exhalation serves as a method to evaluate the metabolic processing of urea in the body. This highlights the role of exhalation in monitoring urea levels and potentially assessing metabolic function."
