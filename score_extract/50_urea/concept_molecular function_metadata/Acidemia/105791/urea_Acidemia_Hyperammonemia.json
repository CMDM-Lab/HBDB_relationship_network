    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to acidemia through its role in the urea cycle and the consequences of hyperammonemia. The text discusses conditions leading to hyperammonemia, which can result from disrupted urea metabolism, potentially contributing to acid-base imbalances such as acidemia. Urease-producing infections can exacerbate hyperammonemia, further linking urea metabolism to acidemia in clinical scenarios."
