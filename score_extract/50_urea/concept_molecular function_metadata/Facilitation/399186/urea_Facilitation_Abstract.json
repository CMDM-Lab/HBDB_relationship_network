    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the concept of facilitation through the study of UreI, a protein that enhances urea transport in oocytes. The research indicates that UreI facilitates a significant increase in urea uptake at lower pH levels, demonstrating a direct relationship between urea transport and the facilitative role of UreI in cellular environments. This suggests that UreI is crucial for efficient urea transport, particularly under acidic conditions."
