    "summary": "In this context, high urea levels are shown to activate signaling pathways in mouse renal inner medullary cells, leading to increased expression of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153). This suggests that high urea not only initiates mitogenic signaling but also induces oxidative stress, which is associated with growth arrest in these cells. The findings indicate a direct relationship between elevated urea and mechanisms that promote growth arrest, particularly through oxidative stress and its effects on cellular components."
