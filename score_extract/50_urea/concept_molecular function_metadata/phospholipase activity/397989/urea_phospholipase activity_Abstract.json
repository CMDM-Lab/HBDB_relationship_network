    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to its effects on the abundance of glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and the activity of phospholipase B, specifically neuropathy target esterase (NTE). While high NaCl increases NTE's phospholipase activity, high urea does not affect this enzyme's activity or its mRNA abundance. Both high NaCl and urea inhibit GDPD5 activity, which leads to increased GPC levels by preventing its degradation. Thus, urea's role is more about its lack of effect on phospholipase activity compared to the significant influence of high NaCl."
