    "summary": "In this context, urea and heme biosynthesis are mentioned as part of distinct metabolic pathways, specifically categorized into Type C (Urea cycle) and Type B (Heme biosynthesis) co-sets. While both are essential metabolic processes, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between urea and heme biosynthesis, merely indicating their classification within mitochondrial metabolism and the impact of SNPs on heme biosynthesis enzymes."
