    "summary": "In this context, urea concentration is linked to renal blood flow (RBF) as an increase in urea levels may indicate a reduction in RBF and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to factors such as fluid volume deficiency and increased protein catabolism following physical stress events (PSE). The relationship suggests that elevated urea can serve as a marker for compromised renal perfusion and function, particularly after strenuous exercise."
