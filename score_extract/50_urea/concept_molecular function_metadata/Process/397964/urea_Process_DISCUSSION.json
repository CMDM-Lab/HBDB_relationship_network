    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its production and excretion processes in the intestines of certain fish species. The study highlights the role of intestinal tissues in urea production from ammonia, suggesting that this process is significant during digestion. The findings indicate that urea production rates in the intestine correlate with overall urea excretion in vivo, emphasizing the importance of this metabolic process in ammoniotelic fish."
