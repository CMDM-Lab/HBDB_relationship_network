    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized to investigate the fibrillation process of apoSOD1ΔIVΔVII. The dependencies of the fibrillation lag time and elongation rate constant on urea concentration suggest that urea plays a critical role in modulating the microscopic reaction steps involved in the fibrillation process. The study highlights how changes in urea concentration affect the kinetics of fibrillation, indicating a significant relationship between urea and the underlying processes of protein aggregation."
