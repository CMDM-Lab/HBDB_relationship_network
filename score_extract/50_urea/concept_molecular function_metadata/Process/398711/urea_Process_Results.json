    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized as a denaturant to modulate the folding process of the protein PapD. The study employs a urea jump to slow down the refolding kinetics, allowing for detailed observation of the protein's folding phases through various techniques. This indicates that urea plays a critical role in the process of protein folding by affecting the stability and dynamics of the protein structure during refolding experiments."
