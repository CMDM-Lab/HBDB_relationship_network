    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant in the analysis of scattering curves for sAPPÎ± isoforms. The presence of 6 m urea indicates a significant change in the denaturation process of these proteins, suggesting that urea plays a critical role in altering protein structure and behavior during the experimental process. However, the specific details of how urea interacts with the proteins or the implications of this process are not elaborated upon."
