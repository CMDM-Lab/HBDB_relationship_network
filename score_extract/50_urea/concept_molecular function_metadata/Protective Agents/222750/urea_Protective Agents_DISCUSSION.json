    "summary": "In this context, urea is identified as a cryoprotectant that provides protective effects against cellular damage during freezing and thawing processes. It reduces osmotic loss of cell water and ice formation, demonstrating concentration-dependent cryoprotective efficacy. Urea also protects cells from hyperionic stress, indicating its role as a protective agent in biological systems, particularly in freeze-tolerant organisms."
