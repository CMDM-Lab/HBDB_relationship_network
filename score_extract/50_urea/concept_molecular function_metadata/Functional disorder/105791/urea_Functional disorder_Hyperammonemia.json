    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to functional disorders through its role in the urea cycle, which is crucial for metabolizing ammonia. Elevated blood ammonium levels, often due to urea cycle dysfunction, can lead to severe complications such as intracranial hypertension and encephalopathy. The persistence of hyperammonemia indicates a functional disorder in ammonium metabolism, highlighting the importance of urea in maintaining metabolic balance and preventing neurological impairments."
