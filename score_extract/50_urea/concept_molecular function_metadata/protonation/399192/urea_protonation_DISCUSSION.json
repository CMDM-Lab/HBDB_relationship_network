    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to protonation through the mechanism of urea transport across the membrane in H. pylori. The protonation of adjacent histidine residues, which have a pKa around 6.0, is suggested to facilitate hydrogen bonding with carboxylic acids, thereby enabling urea transport. This indicates a biochemical interaction where protonation plays a role in the functionality of urea transport mechanisms, although the relationship is not extensively detailed."
