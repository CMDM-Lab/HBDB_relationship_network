    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the process of protonation through the activation of the UreI protein, which is involved in urea transport. The protonation of specific histidine residues, particularly Histidine 123, is crucial for the acid activation of urea uptake. The study indicates that changes in pH affect the protonated state of histidine, which in turn influences urea transport activity."
