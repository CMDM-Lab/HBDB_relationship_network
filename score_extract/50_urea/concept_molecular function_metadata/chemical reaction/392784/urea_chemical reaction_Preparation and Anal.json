    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its chemical reactions, particularly its decomposition when boiled in an aqueous solution, leading to the formation of carbonic acid, acetic acid, and ammonia. The historical analysis of urea's properties and its chemical reactions, including its purification and crystallization methods, highlights its significance in chemical studies. Urea's chemical behavior is central to understanding its role in various biochemical processes and its applications in medicine and biochemistry."
