    "summary": "In this context, urea and hyperammonemia are directly related through the urea cycle, which is crucial for converting ammonia into urea for elimination from the body. A deficiency in ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), an enzyme in this cycle, leads to the accumulation of ammonia (hyperammonemia), resulting in severe neurological consequences. This highlights the critical role of urea in preventing hyperammonemia."
