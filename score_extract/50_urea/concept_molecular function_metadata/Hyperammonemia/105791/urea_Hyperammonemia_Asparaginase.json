    "summary": "In this context, urea and hyperammonemia are related through the urea cycle, where urea is a product of the breakdown of arginine, catalyzed by arginase. ASL deficiency, a urea cycle disorder, leads to hyperammonemia due to impaired conversion of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate, resulting in elevated ammonia levels. This condition is characterized by neurological symptoms and is a direct consequence of disrupted urea metabolism."
