    "summary": "In this context, urea and hyperammonemia are related through the urea cycle, which is responsible for converting ammonia into urea for excretion. Hyperammonemia, characterized by elevated ammonia levels, can occur due to disruptions in this cycle, leading to potential complications such as increased mortality in lung transplant patients. The presence of hyperammonemia indicates a failure in the body's ability to process ammonia, which is normally converted to urea, highlighting the critical role of urea in preventing toxic ammonia accumulation."
