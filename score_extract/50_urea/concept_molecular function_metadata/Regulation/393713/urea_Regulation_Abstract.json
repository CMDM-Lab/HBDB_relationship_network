    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the regulation of the OTC (ornithine transcarbamylase) gene by the transcription factor HNF4α. The study indicates that HNF4α is essential for maintaining urea homeostasis through its direct regulatory effect on the OTC promoter. This highlights the critical role of regulation in urea metabolism, particularly in the liver."
