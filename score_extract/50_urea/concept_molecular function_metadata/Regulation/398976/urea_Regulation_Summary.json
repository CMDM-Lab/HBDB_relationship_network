    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to its transport and regulation in the gill of toadfish. The study indicates that the expression of tUT mRNA, responsible for urea transport, does not vary significantly during the urea pulse cycle, suggesting that the regulation of urea excretion is not primarily controlled at the mRNA level. This highlights a specific regulatory mechanism for urea transport in aquatic organisms, contrasting with known mechanisms in mammalian kidneys."
