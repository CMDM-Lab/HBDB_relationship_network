    "summary": "In this context, urea is described as a cryoprotective agent that functions at the cellular level and potentially at higher levels of physiological organization. It helps protect cells from hyperionic stress and apoptotic death, and its protective properties are linked to its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, particularly in cardiac tissues. This suggests that urea plays a significant role in maintaining physiological integrity during stress conditions, indicating a strong relationship with physiological organization."
