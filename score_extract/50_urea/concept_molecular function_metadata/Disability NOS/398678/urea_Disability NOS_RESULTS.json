    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the urea breath test, which was found to be significantly associated with levels of disability among participants. Specifically, a greater level of disability correlated with an inability to perform the urea breath test. This suggests that urea testing may be impacted by the functional abilities of individuals with disabilities, indicating a potential relationship between urea metabolism and disability status."
