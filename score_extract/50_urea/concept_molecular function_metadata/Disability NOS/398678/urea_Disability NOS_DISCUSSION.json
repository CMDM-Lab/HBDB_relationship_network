    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the urea breath test, which is evaluated for its effectiveness in diagnosing H. pylori infection among adults with varying levels of intellectual disability (referred to as Disability NOS). The study indicates that the urea breath test can be performed by individuals with milder disabilities, suggesting a potential link between the test's applicability and the population's cognitive abilities. However, the relationship between urea and Disability NOS is not deeply explored beyond the context of testing for H. pylori."
