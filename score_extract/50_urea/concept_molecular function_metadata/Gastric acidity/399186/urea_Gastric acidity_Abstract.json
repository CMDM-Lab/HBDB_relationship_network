    "summary": "In this context, urea and gastric acidity are interconnected through the activity of urease in response to pH levels. Urease activity is crucial for buffering the acidic environment of the stomach, particularly in Helicobacter pylori, which requires urea to counteract gastric acidity. The study highlights that the permeability of urea is insufficient to meet the demands of urease activity under acidic conditions, indicating a significant relationship between urea availability and gastric acidity for bacterial survival."
