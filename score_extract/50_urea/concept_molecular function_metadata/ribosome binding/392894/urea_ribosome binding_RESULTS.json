    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to its solubility and extraction from polypeptides that are bound to ribosomes. The addition of puromycin, which releases the polypeptide from the ribosome, decreases the quantity of urea-soluble product. However, ribosome binding itself does not seem to affect the susceptibility of the polypeptide to urea extraction, indicating a nuanced relationship where urea's role is more about solubility rather than direct interaction with ribosome binding."
