    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized in the 13C urea breath test (UBT) to assess gastric emptying and the presence of H. pylori. The test involves the ingestion of urea mixed with a fatty meal, which is designed to prolong gastric emptying. The measurement of expired gases post-ingestion provides insights into gastric function and H. pylori activity, indicating a direct relationship between urea and gastric emptying in the diagnostic process."
