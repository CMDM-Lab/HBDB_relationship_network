    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized in the 13C-urea breath test to detect H. pylori infection, with gastric emptying playing a crucial role in the test's effectiveness. The rate of gastric emptying influences the residence time of urea in the stomach, which is theorized to enhance interaction with H. pylori, thereby affecting the sensitivity of the test. Factors such as test meal composition and citric acid ingestion are discussed as they relate to gastric emptying and the subsequent performance of the urea breath test."
