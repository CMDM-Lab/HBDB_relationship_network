    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant in the study of the denaturation process of LCI (lysozyme). The text indicates that native LCI is resistant to denaturation by urea even at high concentrations (8 m), suggesting that urea does not effectively induce denaturation in this protein. This highlights a specific relationship where urea's role as a denaturant is contrasted with its ineffectiveness in denaturing LCI, emphasizing the unique stability of this protein against urea-induced denaturation."
