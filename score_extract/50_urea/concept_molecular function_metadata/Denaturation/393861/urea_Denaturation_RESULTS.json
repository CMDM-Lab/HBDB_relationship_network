    "summary": "In this context, urea is examined for its effect on the denaturation of LCI, a protein with tryptophan residues. The study indicates that while increasing concentrations of urea enhance fluorescence intensity, they do not lead to denaturation, as evidenced by the lack of a redshift in the fluorescence spectrum. This suggests that urea does not induce denaturation in LCI, contrasting with the effects of GdnHCl, which does cause denaturation as indicated by a redshift in the spectrum."
