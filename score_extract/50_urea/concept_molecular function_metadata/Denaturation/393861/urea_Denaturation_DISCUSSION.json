    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant that disrupts noncovalent interactions stabilizing protein structures, particularly in the unfolding of proteins like LCI. However, the text indicates that urea was unable to denature LCI, highlighting its high stability against denaturation. This suggests a specific relationship where urea's role as a denaturant is contrasted with the stability of certain proteins."
