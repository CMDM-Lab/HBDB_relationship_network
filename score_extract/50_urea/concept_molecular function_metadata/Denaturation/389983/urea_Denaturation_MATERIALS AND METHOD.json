    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant in experiments involving the protein PSD-95 PDZ3. The study monitors the effects of urea on the denaturation process of this protein, utilizing techniques such as circular dichroism and fluorescence to assess changes in structure and binding kinetics. This indicates a direct relationship where urea plays a critical role in inducing denaturation of the protein under specific experimental conditions."
