    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant in the study of the protein PSD-95 PDZ3. The circular dichroism and fluorescence-monitored experiments demonstrate how varying concentrations of urea lead to the denaturation of the protein, indicating its role in unfolding protein structures. The data suggest a quantitative relationship between urea concentration and the degree of denaturation, highlighting urea's effectiveness as a denaturant in biochemical studies."
