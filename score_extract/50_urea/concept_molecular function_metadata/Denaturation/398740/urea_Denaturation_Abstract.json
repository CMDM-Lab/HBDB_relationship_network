    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to study the stability of the gelsolin variants in relation to their susceptibility to proteolysis. The effects of urea on the denaturation of the protein constructs are analyzed, revealing that the D187N variant is slightly destabilized under urea denaturation conditions, while the D187Y variant shows greater instability. This indicates a direct relationship between urea concentration and the denaturation process of the protein, affecting its structural integrity and potential for amyloidosis."
