    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a denaturant used in the study of protein stability, particularly in relation to the D187Y mutant of staphylococcal nuclease. The presence of urea influences the unfolding and denaturation of proteins, affecting their stability and aggregation behavior. The analysis suggests that urea plays a critical role in understanding the denaturation process of the proteins studied, highlighting its importance in protein biochemistry."
