    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to fluorescence-based denaturation curves for S2loop constructs. The study indicates challenges in fitting the denaturation curves due to steep pretransition baselines, suggesting that urea plays a role in the denaturation process being analyzed. However, the specific mechanisms or interactions between urea and denaturation are not elaborated upon in detail."
