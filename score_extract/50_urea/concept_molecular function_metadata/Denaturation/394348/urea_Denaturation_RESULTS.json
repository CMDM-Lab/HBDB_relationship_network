    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturing agent to unfold the protein PAI-2, which is crucial for analyzing its inhibitory activity. The study highlights that PAI-2 is completely unfolded in 8 m urea, indicating a direct relationship where urea facilitates the denaturation process, allowing for the assessment of PAI-2's structural and functional properties. This relationship is significant as it underlines the role of urea in protein denaturation studies."
