    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a chemical denaturant to induce transitions between the native and denatured states of the protein BBL. The study observes how the population of these states varies with the concentration of urea during chemical denaturation, indicating that urea plays a critical role in facilitating the denaturation process by affecting the protein's structural stability. This relationship highlights the importance of urea in protein folding studies and its impact on the denaturation process."
