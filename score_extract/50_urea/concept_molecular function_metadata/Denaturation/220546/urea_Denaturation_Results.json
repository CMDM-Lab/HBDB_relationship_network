    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to study the denaturation of the protein BBL. The analysis indicates that the denatured state of the protein in urea shows a distinct FRET efficiency, allowing for the differentiation between native and denatured states. The results suggest that urea effectively induces denaturation, providing insights into protein folding mechanisms."
