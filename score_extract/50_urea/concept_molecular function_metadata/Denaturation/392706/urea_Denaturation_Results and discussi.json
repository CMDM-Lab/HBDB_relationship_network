    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to its role in denaturation processes. The study investigates how varying concentrations of urea affect the denaturation of a collagen-binding protein (CBD) in the presence of calcium. The results suggest that urea influences the structural properties of proteins, potentially affecting their stability and function during biochemical processes."
