    "summary": "In this context, urea is used to induce denaturation of isomerases during incubations with 13-cRA. The study aims to observe the effects of urea on the denaturation process over various time points, specifically assessing how urea influences the generation of t-RA compared to controls. This indicates a direct relationship where urea acts as a denaturing agent affecting enzyme activity."
