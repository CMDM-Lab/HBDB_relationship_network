    "summary": "In this context, urea is identified as a potent protein denaturant that significantly affects the catalytic activities of RCH, an enzyme involved in the conversion of 13-cRA to t-RA. The study shows that urea causes a marked decline in isomerase activities, indicating that the denaturation of the enzyme by urea is responsible for the observed loss of catalytic function. This relationship highlights the role of urea in altering protein structure and function, particularly in enzymatic reactions."
