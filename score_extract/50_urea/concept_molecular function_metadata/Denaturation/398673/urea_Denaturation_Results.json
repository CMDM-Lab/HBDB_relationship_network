    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to study the unfolding and stability of proteins, specifically the molten globule state of HLA. The denaturation curve indicates how urea concentration affects protein stability and conformational changes. The relationship is significant as urea plays a critical role in inducing denaturation, allowing for the exploration of protein folding landscapes and misfolded states."
