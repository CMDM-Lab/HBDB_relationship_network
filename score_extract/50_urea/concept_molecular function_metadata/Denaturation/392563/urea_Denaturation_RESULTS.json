    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed as a denaturant that influences the scattering behavior of sAPPÎ± isoforms in solution. The presence of 6 m urea leads to significant changes in the protein's scattering function, indicating that urea plays a critical role in the denaturation process of these proteins, similar to the effects observed with GdnHCl. This suggests that urea is effective in altering protein structure, which is a key aspect of denaturation."
