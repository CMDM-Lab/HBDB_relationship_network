    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to monitor the denaturation of the Runt domain protein through fluorescence spectroscopy. The study involves incubating the Runt domain with increasing concentrations of urea, which facilitates the unfolding of the protein structure, allowing for the assessment of denaturation via tryptophan fluorescence. This indicates a direct relationship where urea acts as a chemical agent that induces denaturation in proteins."
