    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to denaturation, specifically in the context of studying the stability of the Runt domain structure. Urea is commonly used as a denaturant in biochemical studies to disrupt protein structures. The data indicates that the N109A mutation affects the stability of the Runt domain, which is assessed through urea denaturation experiments, suggesting a direct relationship between urea and the denaturation process of the protein structure."
