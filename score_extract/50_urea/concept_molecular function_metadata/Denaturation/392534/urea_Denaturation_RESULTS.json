    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturant to assess protein stability through denaturation measurements. The study employs urea to monitor changes in the fluorescence of a tryptophan residue in the Runt domain, providing a quantitative measure of how alanine substitutions affect protein stability. This indicates a direct relationship where urea plays a critical role in the denaturation process of proteins."
