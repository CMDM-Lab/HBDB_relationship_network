    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to protein carbonylation in the renal inner medulla of normal mice. The study indicates that high concentrations of urea, along with NaCl, lead to increased carbonylation of proteins in mIMCD3 cells and in vivo. This suggests that urea plays a significant role in the biochemical process of protein carbonylation, particularly in the renal environment where its concentration is elevated."
