    "summary": "In this context, urea is investigated for its potential to induce oxidative stress, which is assessed by measuring protein carbonylation in mIMCD3 cells. The study suggests that high levels of urea can lead to oxidative damage, indicated by increased protein carbonylation, highlighting a direct relationship between urea exposure and protein oxidation in renal cells."
