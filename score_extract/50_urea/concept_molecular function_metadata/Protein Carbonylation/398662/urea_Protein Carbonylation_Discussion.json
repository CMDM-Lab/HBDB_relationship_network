    "summary": "In this context, urea is implicated as a potential uremic toxin that contributes to oxidative stress and increased protein carbonylation, particularly in the setting of chronic renal failure. The study suggests that elevated urea levels lead to higher protein carbonylation, which alters protein function and may be toxic. This relationship highlights the detrimental effects of urea on protein integrity in renal pathology."
