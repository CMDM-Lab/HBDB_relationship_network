    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a product of hepatocyte function, specifically in relation to its secretion by replated human liver cells (HLCs). While exocytosis is a cellular process involved in the secretion of substances, including urea, the context does not explicitly detail the mechanism of exocytosis in relation to urea secretion. Thus, the relationship is implied but not directly discussed."
