    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a product of mature hepatocyte functions, specifically in relation to albumin and urea secretion. While exocytosis is a cellular process involved in the secretion of substances, including urea from hepatocytes, the context does not explicitly detail the mechanism of exocytosis in relation to urea secretion. However, the implication is that urea secretion likely involves exocytotic processes in functional hepatocytes."
