    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned as a component used to unfold the prion peptide PrP (109â€“149) in a study examining its aggregation behavior. The relationship to light scattering is indirect, as light scattering values are used to measure the extent of peptide aggregation, which is influenced by the presence of urea. However, the specific role of urea in relation to light scattering is not elaborated upon, making the connection somewhat tenuous."
