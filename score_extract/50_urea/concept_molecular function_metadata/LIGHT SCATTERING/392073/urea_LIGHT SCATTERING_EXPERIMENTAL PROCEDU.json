    "summary": "In this context, urea is used as a denaturing agent to unfold peptides prior to monitoring their aggregation through light scattering measurements. The light scattering technique is employed to assess the extent of aggregation of the peptides in solution, indicating a direct relationship where urea influences the aggregation behavior observed via light scattering. This suggests that urea plays a critical role in the experimental setup for analyzing peptide aggregation dynamics."
