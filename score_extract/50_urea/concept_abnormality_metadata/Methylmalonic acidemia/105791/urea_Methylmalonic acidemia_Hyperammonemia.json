    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) through the discussion of metabolic disorders that can lead to hyperammonemia. Methylmalonic acidemia is an organic acidemia that can result in elevated ammonia levels, which may disrupt the urea cycle. The mention of urea highlights its role in detoxifying ammonia, a byproduct of amino acid metabolism, which is relevant in the context of MMA and its metabolic consequences."
