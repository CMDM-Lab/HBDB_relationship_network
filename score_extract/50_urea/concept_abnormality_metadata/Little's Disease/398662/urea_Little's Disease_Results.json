    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its role in protein carbonylation, which occurs rapidly upon its addition to cells. However, there is no mention of Little's Disease or any direct connection between urea and this condition. The focus is solely on the biochemical effects of urea on protein modification, lacking any relevance to Little's Disease."
