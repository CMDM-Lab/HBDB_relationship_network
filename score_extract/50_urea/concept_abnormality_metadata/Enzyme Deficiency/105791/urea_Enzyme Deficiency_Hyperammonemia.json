    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to enzyme deficiencies through the discussion of urea cycle disorders (UCDs), which result from deficiencies in specific enzymes involved in the urea cycle. These deficiencies lead to the accumulation of ammonia and associated neurological impairments, highlighting the critical role of urea metabolism in cognitive function and overall health. The text emphasizes that even partial deficiencies can result in significant neurocognitive issues, indicating a strong relationship between urea levels and enzyme function."
