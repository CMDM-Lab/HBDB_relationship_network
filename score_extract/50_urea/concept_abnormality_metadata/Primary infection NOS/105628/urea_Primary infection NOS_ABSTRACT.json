    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to a study evaluating the avidity of IgG antibodies for cytomegalovirus (CMV) using a test that incorporates 6 M urea. This test aims to differentiate between primary CMV infections and past infections or reactivations. However, the relationship between urea and primary infection NOS is not explicitly detailed beyond its role in the assay, indicating a limited connection."
