    "summary": "In this context, urea is implicated as a uremic toxin in chronic kidney failure, contributing to oxidative stress and protein modification through processes like carbonylation and carbamylation. Elevated urea levels lead to increased cyanate formation, which exacerbates protein toxicity and dysfunction, highlighting a direct relationship between urea and the pathophysiology of chronic kidney failure."
