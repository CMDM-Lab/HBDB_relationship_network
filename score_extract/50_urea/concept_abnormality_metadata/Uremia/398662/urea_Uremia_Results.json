    "summary": "In this context, urea and uremia are closely related, as uremia is characterized by elevated urea levels in the blood, typically ranging from 20 to 80 mM, compared to the normal plasma concentration of 5 mM. The text discusses how increased urea concentrations can lead to protein carbonylation and affect enzyme activity, indicating a direct biochemical impact of urea in the context of renal failure and its associated complications."
