    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly linked to uremia, as high concentrations of urea are associated with the carbonylation of proteins in renal cells, which is a characteristic of uremia. The study indicates that elevated urea levels can contribute to cellular damage and dysfunction, highlighting its role in the pathophysiology of uremia. Additionally, systemic urea concentration increases in uremia, further establishing a clear relationship between the two terms."
