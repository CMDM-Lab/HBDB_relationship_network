    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency through the discussion of metabolic disorders that lead to hyperammonemia. The deficiency affects fatty acid oxidation, resulting in the accumulation of metabolites that can inhibit the urea cycle, potentially leading to elevated ammonia levels. While urea is a product of the urea cycle, its specific relationship to Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more general connection to metabolic disturbances rather than a direct interaction."
