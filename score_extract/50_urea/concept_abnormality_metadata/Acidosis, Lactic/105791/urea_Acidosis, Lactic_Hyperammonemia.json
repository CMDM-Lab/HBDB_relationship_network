    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to lactic acidosis through the discussion of hyperammonemia, which can occur alongside metabolic disturbances such as lactic acidosis. The text mentions that hyperammonemia can be associated with various metabolic crises, including those characterized by lactic acidosis. However, the specific relationship between urea and lactic acidosis is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more general connection rather than a direct interaction."
