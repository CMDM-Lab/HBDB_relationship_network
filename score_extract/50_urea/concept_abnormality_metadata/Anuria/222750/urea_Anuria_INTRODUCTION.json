    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to amphibians' physiological responses to environmental stressors, including anuria, which is the absence of urine production. Urea accumulation occurs as a response to osmotic challenges, such as dehydration and cold exposure, which can lead to anuria in amphibians. The relationship highlights how urea serves as a protective mechanism during periods of water deficit, suggesting that anuria may be a condition that prompts urea accumulation to mitigate cellular damage."
