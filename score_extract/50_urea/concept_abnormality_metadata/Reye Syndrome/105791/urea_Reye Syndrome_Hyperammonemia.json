    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to Reye Syndrome through the discussion of hyperammonemia, a condition characterized by elevated ammonia levels in the blood. Reye Syndrome features hyperammonemia of unclear cause, which may suggest a disrupted urea cycle. The context highlights that urea metabolism is crucial for ammonia detoxification, linking it to the pathophysiology of Reye Syndrome, although the specific role of urea is not elaborated upon."
