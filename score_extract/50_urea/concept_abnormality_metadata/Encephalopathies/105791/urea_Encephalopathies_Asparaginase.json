    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to encephalopathies through the urea cycle and its associated disorders. Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency leads to hyperammonemia, which is a common cause of encephalopathy. The accumulation of argininosuccinate and reduced arginine synthesis in ASL deficiency contributes to neurological symptoms, highlighting the connection between urea metabolism and encephalopathy in affected patients."
