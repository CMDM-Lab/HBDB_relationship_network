    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to encephalopathies through the discussion of hyperammonemia and its effects on the central nervous system. Conditions that disrupt the urea cycle can lead to elevated ammonia levels, resulting in metabolic crises characterized by respiratory alkalosis, cerebral edema, and coma. The relationship highlights how urea cycle disorders can precipitate encephalopathy due to ammonia toxicity."
