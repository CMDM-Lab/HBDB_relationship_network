    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to hereditary diseases through the discussion of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, which is a genetic disorder affecting the urea cycle. OTC deficiency is the most common inherited disease among urea cycle enzyme deficiencies, indicating that mutations in specific genes can lead to abnormal urea metabolism, thus linking urea to hereditary diseases. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the genetic aspect rather than a direct interaction between urea and hereditary diseases."
