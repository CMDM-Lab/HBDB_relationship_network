    "summary": "In this context, urea is a component of the CURB-65 score, which is a clinical tool used to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and predict mortality risk. The CURB-65 score includes urea levels (≥7 mol·L−1) as one of its criteria, indicating that elevated urea can signify worse outcomes in CAP patients. This establishes a direct relationship between urea and the CURB-65 score in evaluating patient prognosis."
