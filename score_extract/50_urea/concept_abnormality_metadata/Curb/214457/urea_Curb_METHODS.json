    "summary": "In this context, urea is a critical component of the CURB-65 score, which is used to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients. Specifically, a urea level greater than 7 mmol·L−1 contributes to the scoring system, indicating a potential risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The CURB-65 score incorporates urea as one of its parameters, linking it directly to patient assessment and management."
