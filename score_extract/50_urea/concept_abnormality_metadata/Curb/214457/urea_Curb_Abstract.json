    "summary": "In this context, urea is a component of the CURB-65 scoring system, which is used to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients. Specifically, a urea level greater than 7 mmol·L−1 is one of the criteria for determining the CURB-65 score, which helps in evaluating the need for hospitalization and predicting mortality risk. The relationship highlights the importance of urea as a clinical marker in the CURB-65 assessment for younger patients with CAP."
