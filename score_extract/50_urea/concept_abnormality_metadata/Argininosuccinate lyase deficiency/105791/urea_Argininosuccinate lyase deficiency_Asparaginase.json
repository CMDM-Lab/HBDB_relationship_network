    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASL deficiency) through the urea cycle, where ASL catalyzes the breakdown of argininosuccinate to arginine and fumarate. ASL deficiency leads to argininosuccinic aciduria and reduced arginine synthesis, which can affect urea production. Consequently, patients with ASL deficiency experience hyperammonemia and other urea cycle disorder symptoms, highlighting the importance of urea metabolism in this condition."
