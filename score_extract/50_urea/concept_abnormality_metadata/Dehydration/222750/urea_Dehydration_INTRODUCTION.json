    "summary": "In this context, urea is closely related to dehydration in the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), as it accumulates in response to environmental water deficits and contributes to increased plasma osmotic pressure during dehydration. The study indicates that urea plays a crucial role in osmotic homeostasis, particularly during hibernation in dry conditions, suggesting its importance for survival in dehydrated states."
