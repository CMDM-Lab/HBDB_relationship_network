    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed as a response mechanism in amphibians to osmotic challenges, including dehydration. Urea accumulation helps mitigate osmotic dehydration of cells and reduces ice formation during freezing-thawing processes. This suggests that urea plays a protective role in maintaining cellular integrity under conditions of dehydration and environmental water deficit."
