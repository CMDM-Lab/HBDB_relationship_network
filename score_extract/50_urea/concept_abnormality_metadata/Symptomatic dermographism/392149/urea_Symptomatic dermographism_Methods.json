    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the diagnostic methods for H. pylori infection, which is linked to chronic urticaria. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with symptomatic dermographism. The focus is primarily on the criteria for diagnosing urticaria and the role of H. pylori, leaving the connection between urea and symptomatic dermographism unclear and indirect."
