    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to kidney failure, highlighting that elevated urea concentrations in the blood (uremia) can lead to increased protein carbonylation, which is a marker of oxidative stress and damage. The study indicates that high urea levels, typical in renal failure, can adversely affect enzyme activity and denature proteins, suggesting a direct chemical impact of urea on cellular proteins in the context of kidney dysfunction."
