    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) through the discussion of hyperammonemia. MCADD can lead to elevated blood ammonium levels due to impaired fatty acid metabolism, which may overwhelm the urea cycle's capacity to remove ammonium. This suggests that patients with MCADD may experience complications related to urea cycle dysfunction, including hyperammonemia, but the relationship is not explicitly detailed."
