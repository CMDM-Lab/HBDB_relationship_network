    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the condition of being comatose through the urea cycle, which is crucial for ammonia detoxification. A deficiency in the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) leads to hyperammonemia, a condition that can result in hyperammonemic coma. Thus, elevated ammonia levels due to impaired urea production can cause severe neurological impairment, including coma."
