    "summary": "In this context, urea is related to Helicobacter infections through the 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT), which is a non-invasive diagnostic method for detecting Helicobacter pylori infection. The test relies on the metabolism of urea by H. pylori, producing carbon dioxide that can be measured in the breath, indicating the presence of the infection. The context emphasizes the importance of urea in the diagnostic process, highlighting its role in the detection of H. pylori."
