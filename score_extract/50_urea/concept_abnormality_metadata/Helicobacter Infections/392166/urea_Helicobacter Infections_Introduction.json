    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to Helicobacter infections through the urea breath test (UBT), which is a noninvasive method used to diagnose Helicobacter pylori infection. The test's accuracy is highlighted, particularly in cirrhotic patients, where it outperforms other diagnostic methods. The presence of urea in the test is crucial for detecting H. pylori, as the bacteria metabolize urea, leading to detectable changes in breath samples."
