    "summary": "In this context, urea and propionic acidemia are related through the discussion of metabolic disorders that can lead to hyperammonemia. Propionic acidemia, an organic acidemia, results from the accumulation of propionate due to disrupted metabolism of certain amino acids and odd-chain fatty acids. This condition can inhibit the urea cycle, leading to elevated ammonia levels, which highlights the importance of urea in detoxifying ammonia in metabolic disorders."
