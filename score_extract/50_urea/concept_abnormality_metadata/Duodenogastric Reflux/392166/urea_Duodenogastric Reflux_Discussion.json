    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to its absorption in the intestinal mucosa and its potential role in duodenogastric reflux. The study indicates that labeled urea was absorbed before reaching the caecum, and the hypothesis suggests that duodenogastric reflux may explain the observed 13C enrichment in patients. This implies a connection between urea absorption and the reflux process, particularly in the context of H. pylori infection and its treatment outcomes."
