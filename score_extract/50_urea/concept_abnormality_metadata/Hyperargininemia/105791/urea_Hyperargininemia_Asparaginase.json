    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to hyperargininemia through the urea cycle, where arginase-1 plays a crucial role in converting arginine to urea. Deficiency in arginase-1 activity, due to mutations in the gene encoding it, leads to the accumulation of arginine and results in hyperargininemia, a condition characterized by elevated arginine levels and associated neurological symptoms. Thus, urea production is impaired in hyperargininemia, linking the two terms through metabolic dysfunction."
