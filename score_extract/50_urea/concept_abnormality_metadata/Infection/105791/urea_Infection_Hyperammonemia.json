    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to infection through the discussion of hyperammonemia, which can occur due to infections with urea-splitting organisms. Elevated blood ammonium levels are associated with various complications, including those arising from infections, suggesting that infections can contribute to metabolic disturbances involving urea metabolism. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the consequences of hyperammonemia rather than a direct link between urea and infection."
