    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to a study evaluating the avidity of IgG antibodies for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. The use of 6 M urea in the enzyme-linked fluorescent assay helps differentiate between primary and past infections. While urea plays a role in the testing process, its direct relationship with infection is limited to its use as a reagent rather than indicating a biological or pathological connection."
