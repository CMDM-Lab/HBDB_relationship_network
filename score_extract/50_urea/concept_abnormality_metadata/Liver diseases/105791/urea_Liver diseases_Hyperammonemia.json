    "summary": "In this context, urea is discussed in relation to liver diseases, particularly focusing on hyperammonemia, which arises from impaired hepatic clearance of ammonium due to severe liver dysfunction. The urea cycle is crucial for converting toxic ammonia into urea for excretion. Deficiencies in urea cycle enzymes can lead to hyperammonemia, highlighting the direct connection between urea metabolism and liver health."
