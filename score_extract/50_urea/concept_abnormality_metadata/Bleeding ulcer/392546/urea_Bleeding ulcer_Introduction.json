    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to bleeding ulcers through the use of the 13C-urea breath test (UBT) for diagnosing H. pylori infection, which is a common cause of ulcers. The study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of UBT in patients with ulcer hemorrhage compared to those with uncomplicated ulcers. While urea is a key component in the breath test, the direct relationship between urea and the condition of bleeding ulcers is not extensively discussed beyond its diagnostic application."
