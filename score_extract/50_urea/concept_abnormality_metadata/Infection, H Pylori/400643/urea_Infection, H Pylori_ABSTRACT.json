    "summary": "In this context, urea is related to the detection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection through the 13C urea breath test (UBT). This diagnostic method relies on the metabolism of urea by H. pylori, which produces carbon dioxide that can be measured. The accuracy of UBT in confirming H. pylori status highlights the significant role of urea in diagnosing this infection."
