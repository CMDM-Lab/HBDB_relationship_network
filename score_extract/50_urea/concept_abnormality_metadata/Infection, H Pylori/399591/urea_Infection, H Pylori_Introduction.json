    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to H. pylori infection through the urea breath test, which utilizes the urease enzyme produced by H. pylori. Patients ingest labeled urea, and the subsequent analysis of exhaled breath for 13CO2/12CO2 ratios indicates the presence of H. pylori. This test's sensitivity and specificity are influenced by various factors, including the amount of urea and the test meal composition."
