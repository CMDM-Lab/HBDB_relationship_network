    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized as a key component in the 13C-urea breath test (UBT), which is a diagnostic tool for confirming H. pylori infection in children. The presence of urease produced by H. pylori hydrolyzes urea, leading to detectable changes in breath samples. This establishes a direct relationship between urea and the diagnosis of H. pylori infection."
