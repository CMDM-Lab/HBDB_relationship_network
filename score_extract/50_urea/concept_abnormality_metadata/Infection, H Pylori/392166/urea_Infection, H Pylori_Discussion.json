    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the diagnosis of H. pylori infection through the urea breath test (13C-UBT). This noninvasive test detects urease activity produced by H. pylori in the stomach, indicating the presence of the infection. The test's effectiveness in confirming H. pylori eradication further emphasizes the critical role of urea in this diagnostic process."
