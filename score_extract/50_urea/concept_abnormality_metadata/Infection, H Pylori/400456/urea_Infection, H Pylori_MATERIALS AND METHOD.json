    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the diagnosis of H. pylori infection through the use of the [13C]urea breath test. This noninvasive test relies on the presence of urease produced by H. pylori, which hydrolyzes urea, leading to detectable changes that confirm infection. The urea-gel test further supports this diagnosis by monitoring color changes in response to urease activity from gastric tissue samples."
