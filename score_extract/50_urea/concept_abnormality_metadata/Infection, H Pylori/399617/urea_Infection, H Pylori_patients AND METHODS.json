    "summary": "In this context, urea is linked to the diagnosis of H. pylori infection through the carbon 13-labeled urea breath test (UBT), which is a non-invasive method used to detect the presence of H. pylori in patients. The test relies on the fact that H. pylori produces urease, which breaks down urea, leading to detectable changes in breath composition. The study involves patients undergoing this test to assess their infection status, indicating a direct relationship between urea and H. pylori infection diagnosis."
