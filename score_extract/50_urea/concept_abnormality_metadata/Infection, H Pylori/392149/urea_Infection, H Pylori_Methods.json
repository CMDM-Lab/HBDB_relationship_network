    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to H. pylori infection through the urea breath test, a diagnostic method used to detect the presence of H. pylori in patients. The test measures the amount of urea that is metabolized by H. pylori, indicating infection. However, the relationship is primarily diagnostic rather than functional, as the focus is on the testing method rather than a direct interaction between urea and the infection itself."
