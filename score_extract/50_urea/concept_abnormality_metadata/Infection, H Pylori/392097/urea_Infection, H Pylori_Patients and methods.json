    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to H. pylori infection through the use of the 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT) for diagnosing and confirming the eradication of H. pylori. The test measures the presence of urease activity from H. pylori, which breaks down urea, producing carbon dioxide that can be detected. Thus, while urea itself is not a direct factor in the infection, it serves as a critical component in the diagnostic process for H. pylori status."
