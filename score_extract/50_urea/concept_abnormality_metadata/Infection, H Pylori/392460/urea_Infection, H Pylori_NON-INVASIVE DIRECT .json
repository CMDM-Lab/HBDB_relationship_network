    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to the diagnosis of H. pylori infection through the urea breath test, which is a non-invasive method for detecting the presence of the bacterium. The test measures the amount of urea that is converted to ammonia and carbon dioxide by H. pylori, indicating infection. The high sensitivity and specificity of the urea breath test make it a recommended diagnostic tool for H. pylori infection, alongside stool testing."
