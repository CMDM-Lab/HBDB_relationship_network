    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to H. pylori infection through the functional 13C-urea breath test (13C-UBT), which is a diagnostic method for detecting H. pylori. The bacterium hydrolyzes urea into ammonia and carbonic acid, a reaction utilized in the breath test to identify active infections. This interaction highlights the role of urea in both the diagnosis and the physiological response to H. pylori, as the ammonia produced can affect gastric pH and bacterial colonization."
