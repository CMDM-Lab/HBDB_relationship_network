    "summary": "In this context, urea is utilized in a breath test to detect H. pylori infection. Participants exhale into foil balloons before and after consuming a 13C-labelled urea solution. The analysis of breath samples measures changes in urea levels, indicating the presence of H. pylori based on the metabolic activity of the bacteria, which hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. This establishes a direct relationship between urea and the detection of H. pylori infection."
