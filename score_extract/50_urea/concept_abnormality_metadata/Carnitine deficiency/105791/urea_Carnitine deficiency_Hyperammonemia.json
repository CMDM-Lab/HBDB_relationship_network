    "summary": "In this context, urea and carnitine deficiency are indirectly related through metabolic processes in the liver. Urea is a product of the urea cycle, which is affected by amino acid metabolism, while carnitine is essential for fatty acid oxidation. Although both are involved in metabolic pathways, the context does not establish a direct relationship between urea levels and carnitine deficiency, focusing instead on the consequences of hyperammonemia and the role of citrulline in improving urea cycle function."
