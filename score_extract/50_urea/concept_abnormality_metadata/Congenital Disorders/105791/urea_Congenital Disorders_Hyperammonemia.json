    "summary": "In this context, urea is directly related to congenital disorders through the discussion of congenital urea cycle disorders (UCDs), which are inherited conditions affecting the enzymes responsible for urea production. Deficiencies in these enzymes lead to hyperammonemia, a critical condition associated with UCDs. The text highlights the genetic basis of these disorders and their clinical implications, indicating a significant relationship between urea metabolism and congenital disorders."
