    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency (OTC deficiency) through the urea cycle, which is crucial for ammonia detoxification. OTC deficiency leads to impaired urea production, resulting in hyperammonemia. This condition exemplifies how deficiencies in urea cycle enzymes, including OTC, can disrupt normal urea synthesis and lead to severe metabolic consequences."
