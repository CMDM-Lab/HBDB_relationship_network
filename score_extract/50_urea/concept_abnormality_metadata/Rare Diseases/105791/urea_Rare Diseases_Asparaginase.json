    "summary": "In this context, urea is indirectly related to rare diseases through the discussion of arginase-1 deficiency, which leads to congenital argininemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is part of a broader category of urea cycle disorders, highlighting the significance of urea metabolism in rare genetic diseases. The mention of urea is tied to the metabolic implications of arginase-1 mutations, which can result in severe neurological symptoms and other health issues."
