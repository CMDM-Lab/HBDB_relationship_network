    "summary": "In this context, urea is mentioned in relation to the diagnostic methods for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, which is being investigated for its potential link to chronic urticaria. Urea breath tests are utilized to confirm H. pylori eradication, but the relationship between urea itself and urticaria is not directly established. The focus is more on the role of H. pylori in urticaria rather than a direct connection between urea and the condition."
