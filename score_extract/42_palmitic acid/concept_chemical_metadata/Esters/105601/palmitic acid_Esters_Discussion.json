    "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid is highlighted as a significant non-volatile lipid molecule in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), with a notable presence in lung surfactant as phospholipid esters. These esters, which comprise over 60% of lung surfactant, indicate a direct relationship between palmitic acid and esters, as the latter are formed from the esterification of palmitic acid. However, the study notes that the analytical method used excludes these esterified forms from measurement, focusing instead on free palmitic acid concentrations."
