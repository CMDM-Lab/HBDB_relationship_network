    "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid is mentioned in relation to isotopes, specifically deuterium (2H) isotopes used in tracer studies. The study involves calculating deuterium recovery and its distribution in the body, with palmitic acid being one of the labeled tracers. This indicates a direct application of isotopes in studying the metabolism of palmitic acid, highlighting their relevance in metabolic research."
