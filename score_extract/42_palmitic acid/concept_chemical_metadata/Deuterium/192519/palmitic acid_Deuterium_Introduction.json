    "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid is discussed in relation to deuterium as a labeling agent for metabolic studies. Deuterium-labeled palmitic acid was validated against 13C-labeled palmitic acid to assess fat oxidation in humans. The study demonstrated a strong correlation in cumulative recoveries of both tracers, indicating that deuterium can effectively track palmitic acid metabolism during rest and potentially under varying physical conditions."
