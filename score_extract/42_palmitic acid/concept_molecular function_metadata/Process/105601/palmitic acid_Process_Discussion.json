    "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid (PA) is discussed as a key component for recalculating eicosanoid concentrations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. The process involves using PA concentration to improve the accuracy of statistical measurements related to the dilution of EBC, particularly in differentiating between smokers and non-smokers. This suggests that PA plays a significant role in the analytical process of measuring eicosanoids, which are linked by common metabolic pathways."
