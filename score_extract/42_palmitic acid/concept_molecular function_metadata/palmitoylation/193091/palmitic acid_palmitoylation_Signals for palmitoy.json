    "summary": "In this context, palmitic acid is indirectly related to palmitoylation, as palmitoylation refers to the process of attaching palmitic acid (a fatty acid) to cysteine residues in proteins. The discussion focuses on the specific characteristics and requirements for palmitoylation in integral membrane proteins, particularly proSP-C, highlighting the role of palmitic acid in this post-translational modification. The study emphasizes the significance of palmitoylation in protein localization and function, indicating a clear biochemical relationship between palmitic acid and the palmitoylation process."
