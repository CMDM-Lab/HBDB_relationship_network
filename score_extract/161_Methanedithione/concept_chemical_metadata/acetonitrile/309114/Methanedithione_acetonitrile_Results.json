    "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and acetonitrile are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in the plasma headspace of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction; they are simply part of a list of VOCs that were significantly reduced in EAC patients compared to controls. The focus is on their potential as diagnostic markers rather than any specific connection between the two compounds."
