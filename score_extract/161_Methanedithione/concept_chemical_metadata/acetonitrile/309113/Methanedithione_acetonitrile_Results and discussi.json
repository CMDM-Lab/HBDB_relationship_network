    "summary": "In this context, methanedithione and acetonitrile are both mentioned as solvents tested for their ability to elute nicotine from a cigarette filter pad (CFP). However, there is no direct interaction or comparison between the two solvents regarding their effectiveness or properties. They are simply part of a list of solvents evaluated in the study, with acetonitrile showing lower elution efficiency compared to others, but no specific relationship to methanedithione is established."
