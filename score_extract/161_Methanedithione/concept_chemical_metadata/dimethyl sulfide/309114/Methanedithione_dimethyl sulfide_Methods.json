    "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and dimethyl sulfide are both included in a list of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed using a SIFT-MS instrument. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. They are mentioned as part of a broader analysis of analytes present in blood samples, indicating they are both relevant to the study but without a specific connection between them."
