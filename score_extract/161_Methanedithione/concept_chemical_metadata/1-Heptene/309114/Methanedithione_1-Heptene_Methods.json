    "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione and 1-Heptene are both mentioned as analytes in a study analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from blood samples using SIFT-MS technology. However, there is no discussion of their specific interactions, chemical properties, or relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the list of analytes being measured. They are part of a broader analysis but lack a direct relationship."
