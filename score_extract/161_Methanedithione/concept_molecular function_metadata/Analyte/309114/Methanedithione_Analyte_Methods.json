    "summary": "In this context, Methanedithione is not explicitly mentioned as one of the analytes being measured. Instead, the focus is on a list of 22 preselected analytes analyzed using SIFT-MS technology. While Methanedithione could potentially be an analyte of interest in other studies, it is not directly related to the analytes discussed here, indicating a lack of specific connection in this context."
