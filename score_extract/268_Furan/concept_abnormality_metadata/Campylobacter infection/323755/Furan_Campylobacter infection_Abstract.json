    "summary": "In this context, furan is identified as a volatile compound whose absence is associated with Campylobacter infection in patients with infectious diarrhea. The study highlights that specific gaseous patterns can indicate different causes of diarrhea, with the lack of hydrocarbons and terpenes serving as a marker for Campylobacter infection. This suggests a potential diagnostic role for furan in differentiating between types of infectious diarrhea."
