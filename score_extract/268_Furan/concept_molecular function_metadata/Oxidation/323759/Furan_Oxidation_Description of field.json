    "summary": "In this context, furan is mentioned in relation to its presence among the 17 dioxin and furan congeners analyzed during catalytic and thermal oxidation tests. The investigation focuses on the effectiveness of various catalysts and thermal oxidizers at high temperatures for oxidizing these compounds. While furan is part of the study, the specific relationship between furan and the oxidation process is not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
