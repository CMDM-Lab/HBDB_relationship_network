    "summary": "In this context, furan is mentioned as a significant congener in the distribution of toxic compounds resulting from oxidation processes over different catalysts at varying temperatures. The oxidation reactions lead to the formation of various furan isomers, indicating a direct relationship where furan is a product of oxidation, particularly in the presence of platinum catalysts. The study highlights how temperature influences the congener distribution, emphasizing the role of oxidation in generating these toxic compounds."
