    "summary": "In this context, furan is mentioned in relation to its chlorinated analogs and the impact of bromine (Br) addition on emissions of various compounds, including PCDDs/Fs. The text discusses the relationship between furan and its chlorinated derivatives, indicating that the emissions of certain compounds are influenced by the presence of bromine, but does not provide a direct functional relationship between furan and furan itself, as they are essentially the same compound."
