    "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' and 'furan' refer to the same class of compounds, specifically highlighting 2-penthyl furan as a representative of furans. The text discusses the toxic and potentially carcinogenic nature of furans, which are derived from both natural sources, such as fruits, and from the thermal degradation of other organic molecules. The mention of furan emphasizes its relevance in the context of organic matter degradation and its implications for health."
