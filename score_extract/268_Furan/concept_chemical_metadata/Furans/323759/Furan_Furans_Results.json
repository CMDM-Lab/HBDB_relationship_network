    "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' and 'Furans' are mentioned in relation to their presence in the congener distributions of dioxins and furans during oxidation processes over different catalysts at varying temperatures. The text discusses specific isomers of furans that dominate at certain temperatures, indicating a direct relationship between the two terms as they refer to the same class of compounds, with 'Furan' being the singular form and 'Furans' the plural. Their relationship is significant as they are part of the same chemical family involved in the study."
