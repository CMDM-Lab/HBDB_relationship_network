    "summary": "In this context, 'Furan' and 'Furans' are related as they both refer to chemical compounds involved in the production and distribution of dioxins and furans during catalytic processes. The text discusses how variations in temperature affect the chemistry of these compounds, indicating that they are part of the same chemical family and are influenced by similar environmental conditions. However, the relationship is primarily descriptive rather than indicating a direct interaction or functional significance."
