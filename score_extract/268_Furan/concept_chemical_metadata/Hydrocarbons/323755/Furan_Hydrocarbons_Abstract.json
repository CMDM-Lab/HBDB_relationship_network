    "summary": "In this context, furan is identified as a specific volatile compound associated with Clostridium difficile infections, while hydrocarbons are mentioned in relation to their absence indicating a different type of infection (Campylobacter). The relationship is indirect, as furan is a specific compound within the broader category of hydrocarbons, but their connection is primarily through their presence or absence in the context of infectious diarrhoea diagnostics."
