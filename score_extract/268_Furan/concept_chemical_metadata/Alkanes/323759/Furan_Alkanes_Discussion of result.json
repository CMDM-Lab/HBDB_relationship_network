    "summary": "In this context, furan and alkanes are related through their roles in catalytic processes affecting the production of dioxins and furans. The study indicates that the addition of non-chlorinated organics, specifically alkanes, can reduce or eliminate by-products in the presence of catalysts. This suggests that alkanes may influence the chemistry of furan production, particularly in terms of emissions and congener distribution."
