    "summary": "In this context, furan and indoles are both mentioned as volatile compounds associated with different infectious diarrheal pathogens. Specifically, the presence of furan species is linked to Clostridium difficile infections, while indoles are not indicated in the results. This suggests that while both compounds are relevant to the study of gaseous emissions in infectious diseases, their relationship is not directly established, as furan is specifically noted without indoles in the context of Clostridium difficile."
