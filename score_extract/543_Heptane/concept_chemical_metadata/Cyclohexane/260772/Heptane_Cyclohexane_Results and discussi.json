    "summary": "In this context, heptane and cyclohexane are both identified as significant components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in fuel mixtures, specifically in the headspace of liquid E85 and ULSD. They are categorized together as cycloalkanes and alkanes, contributing to the total volatile organic compound (TTVOC) composition. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between heptane and cyclohexane beyond their classification as components of VOCs in fuel."
