    "summary": "In this context, heptane and aromatic compounds are both identified as significant components of motor vehicle fuels. Heptane, an alkane, is mentioned alongside various aromatic compounds such as toluene and xylene, which are dominant VOCs in gasoline. While they are part of the same fuel composition, the context does not elaborate on any direct interaction or functional relationship between heptane and aromatic compounds beyond their co-occurrence in fuel mixtures."
