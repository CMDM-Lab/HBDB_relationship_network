    "summary": "In this context, heptane and decane are both mentioned as components of standard mixtures prepared for calibration experiments in a chemical analysis setup. They are included in a list of aliphatic hydrocarbons used to create stock solutions for further dilution and analysis. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships beyond their inclusion in the same experimental procedure."
