    "summary": "In this context, heptane and decane are both mentioned as volatile compounds analyzed in breath samples using two different analytical methodologies: OF sensor and GCâ€“MS. The results indicate a strong linear correlation between the two methods for various volatile compounds, including heptane and decane, suggesting that both compounds can be reliably measured and compared in breath analysis. However, there is no specific discussion of their individual biological or chemical interactions beyond their inclusion in the same analytical study."
