    "summary": "In this context, heptane and cycloparaffins are both mentioned as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in fuel compositions, specifically in the headspace of liquid E85 and ULSD. Heptane is categorized as an alkane, while cycloparaffins include compounds like cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane. They are grouped together in the analysis of VOCs, indicating a shared relevance in the study of fuel emissions, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between heptane and cycloparaffins is detailed."
