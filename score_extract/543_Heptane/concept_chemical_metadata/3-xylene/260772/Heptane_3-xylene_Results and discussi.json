    "summary": "In this context, heptane and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in fuel compositions, specifically in the analysis of E85 and gasoline. However, their relationship is not explicitly detailed beyond their presence in the same category of compounds. The study focuses on the overall VOC composition rather than specific interactions or comparisons between heptane and 3-xylene."
