    "summary": "In this context, heptane and toluene are both analyzed as volatile compounds in breath samples using two different analytical methodologies: OF sensor and GCâ€“MS. The study establishes a linear correlation between the results obtained for these compounds, indicating that both heptane and toluene can be reliably measured in breath analysis. However, the relationship is primarily statistical, focusing on their detection rather than any direct biochemical interaction or functional relevance."
