    "summary": "In this context, heptane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in breath samples for their potential as biomarkers for various metabolic disorders. The study aims to develop an optical fiber sensor for real-time monitoring of these VOCs, indicating their relevance in clinical diagnostics. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between heptane and toluene are not detailed, as they are part of a broader analysis of multiple VOCs."
