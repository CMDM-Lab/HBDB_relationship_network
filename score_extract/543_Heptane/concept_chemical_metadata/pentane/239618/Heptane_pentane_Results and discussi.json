    "summary": "In this context, heptane and pentane are both analyzed as volatile compounds in breath sample analysis using two different methodologies: OF sensor and GC–MS. The results indicate a strong linear correlation between the two methods for pentane (R² = 0.9998) and heptane (R² = 0.9925), suggesting that both compounds can be reliably measured and compared in breath analysis. However, the relationship is primarily statistical, focusing on their measurement rather than any direct chemical or biological interaction."
