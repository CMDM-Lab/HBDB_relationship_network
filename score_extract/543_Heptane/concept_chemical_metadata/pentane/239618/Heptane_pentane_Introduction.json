    "summary": "In this context, heptane and pentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in breath samples for their potential as biomarkers for various metabolic disorders. They are part of a broader study aimed at developing an optical fiber sensor for real-time monitoring of exhaled VOCs. However, the specific relationship or interaction between heptane and pentane is not detailed, indicating they are included in the same analytical framework without a direct connection."
