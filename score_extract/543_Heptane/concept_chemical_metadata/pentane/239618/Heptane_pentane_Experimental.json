    "summary": "In this context, heptane and pentane are both mentioned as components of stock solutions prepared for calibration experiments. They are part of a series of aliphatic hydrocarbons used in the study, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions, properties, or any functional relationship beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup. Their mention is primarily for the purpose of standardization in chemical analysis."
