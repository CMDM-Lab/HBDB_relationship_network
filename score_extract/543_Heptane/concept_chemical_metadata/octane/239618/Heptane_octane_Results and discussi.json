    "summary": "In this context, heptane and octane are both analyzed as volatile compounds in breath samples using two different analytical methodologies: OF sensor and GCâ€“MS. The results indicate a strong linear correlation between the two methods for both heptane and octane, suggesting that they behave similarly in breath analysis. However, the context does not delve into any specific biological or chemical interactions between heptane and octane beyond their analytical comparison."
