    "summary": "In this context, heptane and octane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in breath samples for their potential as biomarkers for various metabolic disorders. They are part of a broader study aimed at developing an optical fiber sensor for real-time monitoring of exhaled VOCs, indicating their relevance in clinical diagnostics. However, the specific relationship or interaction between heptane and octane is not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework."
