    "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the alkanes present in the vapor composition of fuels, specifically in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in liquid E85 and ULSD. Alkanes, including heptane, are categorized as saturated hydrocarbons, and their concentrations contribute significantly to the total volatile organic compounds (TTVOC) measured in the study. The relationship is clear as heptane is a specific example of an alkane, highlighting its role within this broader chemical category."
