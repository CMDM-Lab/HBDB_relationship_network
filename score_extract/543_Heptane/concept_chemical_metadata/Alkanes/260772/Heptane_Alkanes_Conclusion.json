    "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as a specific type of alkane present in motor vehicle fuels, particularly in gasoline and other fuel compositions. The study highlights that alkanes, including n-heptane, are dominant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in these fuels. This establishes a clear categorization of heptane as a member of the broader alkane family, emphasizing its relevance in the analysis of fuel compositions."
