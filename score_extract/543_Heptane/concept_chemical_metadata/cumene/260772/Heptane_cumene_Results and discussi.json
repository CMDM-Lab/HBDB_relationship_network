    "summary": "In this context, heptane and cumene are both mentioned as components of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in diesel and biodiesel blends. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships. They are part of a broader analysis of VOC composition in fuels, indicating they share a category but lack detailed connection in the study."
