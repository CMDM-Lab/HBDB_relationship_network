    "summary": "In this context, heptane is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in breath samples, which serve as biomarkers for various metabolic disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis. The study highlights the potential of breath analysis using optical fiber sensors to detect these VOCs non-invasively, suggesting a link between heptane levels and the presence of rheumatoid arthritis among other conditions. However, the specific relationship between heptane and rheumatoid arthritis is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
