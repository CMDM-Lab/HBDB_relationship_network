    "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in exhaled breath, which serves as biomarkers for various metabolic disorders. The study highlights the potential of breath analysis using optical fiber sensors to detect VOCs, including heptane, that are associated with metabolic diseases such as vitamin E deficiency, lipid peroxidation, and oxidative stress. This suggests a direct relevance of heptane in the context of metabolic health monitoring."
