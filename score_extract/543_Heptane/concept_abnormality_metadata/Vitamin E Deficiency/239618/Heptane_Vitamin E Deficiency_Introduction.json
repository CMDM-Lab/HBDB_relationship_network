    "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can serve as a breath biomarker for various metabolic disorders, including vitamin E deficiency. The study emphasizes the potential of optical fiber sensors for real-time analysis of these VOCs, suggesting a link between heptane levels in breath and the metabolic state associated with vitamin E deficiency, which is related to lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress."
