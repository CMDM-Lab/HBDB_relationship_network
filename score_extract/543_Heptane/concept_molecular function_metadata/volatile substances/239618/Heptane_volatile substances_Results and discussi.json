    "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the volatile compounds analyzed in breath samples alongside other substances. The study demonstrates a strong correlation between the results obtained from two analytical methodologies (OF sensor and GCâ€“MS) for heptane and other volatile substances, indicating that heptane is part of a broader category of volatile compounds relevant to breath analysis. However, the specific implications of heptane in relation to the overall analysis of volatile substances are not deeply explored beyond its inclusion in the dataset."
