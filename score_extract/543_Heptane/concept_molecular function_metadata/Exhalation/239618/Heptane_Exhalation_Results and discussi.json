    "summary": "In this context, heptane is analyzed as one of the volatile compounds present in breath samples. The study establishes a strong correlation between the levels of heptane in exhaled air and those reported in healthy subjects, indicating that breath analysis can effectively measure heptane concentrations. The statistical analysis supports the reliability of the results obtained through different analytical methodologies for breath analysis, highlighting the relevance of heptane in the context of exhalation and potential biomarkers for metabolic disorders."
