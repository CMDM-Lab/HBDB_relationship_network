    "summary": "In this context, heptane is identified as one of the volatile compounds analyzed in breath samples, serving as an analyte in the study. The results indicate a strong linear correlation between the concentrations of heptane measured by two different analytical methods (OF sensor and GCâ€“MS), suggesting that heptane is a reliable analyte for breath analysis. The statistical analysis confirms that the results from both methods are not significantly different, reinforcing the validity of heptane as a target analyte in clinical assessments of breath samples."
