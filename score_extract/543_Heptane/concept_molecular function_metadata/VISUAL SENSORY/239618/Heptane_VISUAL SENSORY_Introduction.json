    "summary": "In this context, heptane is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in breath samples for potential biomarkers related to various metabolic disorders. However, there is no direct discussion of its relationship with visual sensory functions. The focus is primarily on the analytical capabilities of optical fiber sensors for detecting VOCs, including heptane, without linking it to visual sensory processes."
