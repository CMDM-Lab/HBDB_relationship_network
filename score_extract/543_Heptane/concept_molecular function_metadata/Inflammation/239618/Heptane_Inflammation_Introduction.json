    "summary": "In this context, heptane is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in breath samples, which serve as biomarkers for various metabolic disorders, including airway inflammation. The study aims to develop an optical fiber sensor for real-time analysis of these VOCs, indicating a potential link between heptane levels and inflammatory conditions. However, the specific relationship between heptane and inflammation is not deeply explored beyond its inclusion in the list of VOCs associated with metabolic disorders."
