    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed in relation to the GSTP1 gene, which encodes the GSTP1-1 enzyme. The study investigates the interaction of NBDHEX with GSTs and GSH, highlighting the role of GSTP1 in binding GSH. The crystal structure of the GSTP1-1/GSH/NBDHEX complex indicates a direct functional relationship, as GSH is a substrate for the GSTP1 enzyme, which is crucial for detoxification processes in cells."
