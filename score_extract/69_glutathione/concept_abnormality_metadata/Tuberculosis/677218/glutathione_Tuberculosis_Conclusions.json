    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensates (EBC) of patients with various pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. The study aims to evaluate GSH levels, which are important for antioxidant defense and may play a role in the inflammatory response associated with tuberculosis. However, the specific relationship between GSH and tuberculosis is not detailed, indicating a potential area of investigation rather than a direct connection."
