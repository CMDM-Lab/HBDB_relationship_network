    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed primarily in relation to its concentration in various biological fluids and the analytical methods used for its detection, notably the spectrophotometric method developed by Tietze. However, Tietze's Syndrome is not directly addressed in relation to glutathione, making the connection between the two terms unclear and lacking specific relevance."
