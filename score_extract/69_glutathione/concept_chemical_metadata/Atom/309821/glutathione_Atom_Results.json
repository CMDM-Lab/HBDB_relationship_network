    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its interaction with the GSTP1-1 enzyme and the NBDHEX compound. The sulfur atom of the cysteine side chain in GSH is positioned to facilitate a reaction with the benzoxadiazole C4 group. However, the term 'Atom' is mentioned in a general sense, referring to the sulfur atom specifically, without establishing a broader or significant relationship with glutathione beyond this specific interaction."
