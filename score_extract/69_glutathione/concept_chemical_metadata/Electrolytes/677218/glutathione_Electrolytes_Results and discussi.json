    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its derivatization for detection purposes, particularly focusing on its thiol group. While electrolytes are not directly mentioned in terms of their interaction with glutathione, the context implies that GSH's properties, such as conductivity, are relevant to its detection. However, there is no explicit connection established between glutathione and electrolytes, limiting the depth of their relationship."
