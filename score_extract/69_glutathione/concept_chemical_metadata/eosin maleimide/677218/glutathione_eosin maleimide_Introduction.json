    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) and eosin maleimide (EMA) are directly related through the use of EMA as a fluorescent tag for the derivatization of GSH in biological samples. The study highlights the application of EMA in capillary electrophoresis-laser induced fluorescence (CEâ€“LIF) for sensitive detection of GSH, demonstrating its effectiveness in quantifying GSH in exhaled breath condensate and saliva. The matching excitation wavelength of EMA with the laser module enhances the detection capabilities, indicating a significant methodological advancement in analyzing GSH levels."
