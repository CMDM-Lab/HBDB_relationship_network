    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed using capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods, specifically through derivatization with 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein. This compound is one of several reagents mentioned that enhance the detection of GSH in biological samples, indicating a direct relationship where 6-iodoacetamidofluorescein serves as a tool for measuring glutathione levels effectively. The focus is on improving detection sensitivity and resolution in GSH analysis."
