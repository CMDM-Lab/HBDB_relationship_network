    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed using capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods, specifically through derivatization with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. This compound is utilized to enhance the detection sensitivity of GSH in biological samples, indicating a direct relationship where 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein serves as a reagent to facilitate the analysis of glutathione levels."
