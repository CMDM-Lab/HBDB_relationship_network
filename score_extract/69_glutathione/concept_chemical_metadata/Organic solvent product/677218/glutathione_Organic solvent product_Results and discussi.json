    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its measurement in biological samples, particularly in the presence of organic solvents. The method developed for capillary electrophoresis (CE) highlights how organic solvents can influence the protein precipitation process, which in turn affects the accurate measurement of GSH levels. While organic solvents are used to facilitate the analysis, the relationship is more about the methodological challenges rather than a direct biochemical interaction between glutathione and organic solvent products."
