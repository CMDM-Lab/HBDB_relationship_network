    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) and hemolysis are related through the analysis of blood samples where hemolysis can significantly affect GSH measurement. Hemolysis can lead to an overestimation of GSH levels in plasma due to the high concentration of GSH in erythrocytes, complicating accurate assessments of oxidative stress and redox status. Proper sample handling is crucial to avoid these artifacts."
