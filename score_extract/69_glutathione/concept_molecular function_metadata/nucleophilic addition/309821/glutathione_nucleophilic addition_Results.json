    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is directly involved in a nucleophilic addition reaction with the benzoxadiazole compound NBDHEX. The formation of a covalent complex, where the sulfur atom of GSH adds to a specific carbon atom of the benzoxadiazole ring, is identified as the rate-limiting step in the reaction. This highlights the critical role of GSH as a nucleophile in the reaction mechanism, emphasizing its importance in biochemical processes involving nucleophilic addition."
