    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is involved in the analysis of drug interactions, specifically with the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST). The study examines how NBDHEX interacts with GST in the presence of GSH, indicating that glutathione plays a crucial role in mediating the binding and activity of drugs like NBDHEX. This suggests that GSH is significant in understanding drug interactions, particularly in the context of detoxification and metabolism."
