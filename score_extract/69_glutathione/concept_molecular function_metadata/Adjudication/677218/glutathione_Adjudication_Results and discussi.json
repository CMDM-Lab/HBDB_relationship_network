    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is mentioned in relation to its analysis in saliva samples using a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method. However, there is no direct connection to 'Adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. The mention of GSH does not imply any evaluative or decision-making process related to adjudication, indicating a lack of relevance between the two terms."
