    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed using a 515nm green laser module in a capillary electrophoresis-laser-induced fluorescence (CEâ€“LIF) setup. The laser's wavelength is specifically chosen to match the excitation spectra of eosin-5-maleimide, a fluorescent tag used for GSH derivatization, allowing for sensitive detection of GSH in biological samples like exhaled breath condensate and saliva. This demonstrates a direct application of laser-generated electromagnetic radiation in the quantification of glutathione."
