    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is directly involved in the conjugation process facilitated by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are enzymes that help detoxify drugs by conjugating them with GSH. This conjugation reduces the pharmacologic activity of various drugs, contributing to multidrug resistance in cancer cells. The relationship is critical as it highlights how GSH and GSTs work together to modify and extrude potentially harmful compounds from cells, particularly in the context of cancer treatment resistance."
