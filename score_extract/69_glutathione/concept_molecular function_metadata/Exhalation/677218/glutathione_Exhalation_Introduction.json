    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its concentrations in various biological fluids, including exhaled breath condensate. While GSH is typically found in higher concentrations in blood and saliva, its presence in exhaled breath is notably low, indicating a potential challenge in measuring its levels accurately. This suggests that exhalation may not be a primary route for GSH detection, but it highlights the need for sensitive analytical methods to assess its levels in breath samples."
