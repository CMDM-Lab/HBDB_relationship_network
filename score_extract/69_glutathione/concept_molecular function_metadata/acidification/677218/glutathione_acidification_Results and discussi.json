    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is analyzed in biological samples, where acidification plays a crucial role in the preparation of these samples for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The process of acidification or the addition of organic solvents is shown to significantly influence the measured GSH content, indicating that proper sample preparation is essential for accurate analysis of glutathione levels. This highlights the importance of acidification in maintaining the integrity of GSH measurements in various biological fluids."
