    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its stability during sample preparation for analysis, particularly highlighting the impact of proteolysis. The text indicates that proteolysis can lead to the degradation of GSH in plasma samples, affecting the accuracy of GSH and GSSG assays. This suggests a significant relationship where proteolysis can influence the measurement and interpretation of glutathione levels in biological samples."
