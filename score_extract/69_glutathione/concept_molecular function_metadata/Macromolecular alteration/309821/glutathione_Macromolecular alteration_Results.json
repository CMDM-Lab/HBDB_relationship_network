    "summary": "In this context, glutathione (GSH) is discussed in relation to its interaction with NBDHEX and the formation of a Ïƒ-complex within the GSTP1-1 enzyme. The study highlights that a conformational change in the enzyme's structure, which is a macromolecular alteration, is essential for the binding and complex formation with GSH. This suggests that the flexibility and structural dynamics of macromolecules are crucial for the biochemical interactions involving glutathione."
