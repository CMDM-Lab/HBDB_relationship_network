    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Clâˆ’) and chlorides are discussed in relation to their measurement in rainwater samples. Chloride is specifically analyzed as part of the chemical composition of the rain, indicating its presence as an ion in the samples. The terms are used interchangeably, with chloride referring to the anion and chlorides generally encompassing all forms of chloride compounds present in the samples. However, there is no detailed exploration of their distinct roles or interactions beyond their measurement."
