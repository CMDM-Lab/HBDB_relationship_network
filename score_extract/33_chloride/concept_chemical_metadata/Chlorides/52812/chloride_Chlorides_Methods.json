    "summary": "In this context, 'chloride' and 'chlorides' refer to the same ion, Cl-, which is involved in the measurement of nasal potential difference (NPD) in cystic fibrosis research. The study discusses changes in chloride conductance during various treatments, indicating that both terms are used interchangeably to describe the same physiological component relevant to ion transport and respiratory function in cystic fibrosis patients."
