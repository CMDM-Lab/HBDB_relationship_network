    "summary": "In this context, 'chloride' and 'Chlorides' refer to the same ion, specifically in the study of ion transport pathways in airway epithelial cells. The research focuses on the regulation of chloride transport through various mechanisms, including CFTR and CaCC, highlighting the importance of chloride ions in lung function and their measurement in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and nasal potential difference (NPD) assessments. The terms are used interchangeably to discuss chloride's role in ion regulation during exercise and pharmacological interventions."
