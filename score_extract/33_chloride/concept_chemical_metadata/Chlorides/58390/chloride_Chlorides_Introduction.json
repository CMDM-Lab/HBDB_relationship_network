    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Clâˆ’) and chlorides are discussed in relation to GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. Chloride ions are essential for the function of these receptors, influencing neuronal excitability by either hyperpolarizing or depolarizing neurons based on their concentrations. The text highlights the importance of chloride homeostasis and transporters in regulating GABAergic signaling, indicating a direct and critical relationship between chloride and chlorides in neuronal function."
