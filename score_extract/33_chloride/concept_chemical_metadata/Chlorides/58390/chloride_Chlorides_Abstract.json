    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Cl-) and chlorides are discussed in relation to their role in GABAergic signaling and the function of chloride transporters like KCC2 and NKCC1. The study highlights how changes in chloride transporter expression can influence neuronal excitability and contribute to epileptiform activity, suggesting that both terms are integral to understanding the mechanisms of epilepsy and potential therapeutic targets."
