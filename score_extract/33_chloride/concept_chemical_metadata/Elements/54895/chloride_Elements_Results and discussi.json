    "summary": "In this context, chloride is mentioned as part of a broader discussion on the content of various elements in pyrolytic residues affected by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) concentration. While chloride itself is not explicitly detailed, it is implied as one of the elements being analyzed alongside others like Al, Na, Ca, and toxic elements. The relationship is indirect, as chloride is part of the elemental composition being studied, but no specific interactions or significance are provided."
