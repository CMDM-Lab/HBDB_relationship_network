    "summary": "In this context, chloride is mentioned in relation to the effects of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) on the composition of coal during pyrolysis. The presence of ZnCl2 is noted to influence the breakdown of coal structure and the subsequent release or alteration of various elemental contents, including chloride. However, the specific role of chloride itself in the coal reaction process is not elaborated upon, indicating a more indirect relationship."
