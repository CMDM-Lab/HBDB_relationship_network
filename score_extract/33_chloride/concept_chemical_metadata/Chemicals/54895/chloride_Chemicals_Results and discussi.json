    "summary": "In this context, chloride, specifically in the form of zinc chloride (ZnCl2), is discussed as a chemical agent used in the activation of biosludge during pyrolysis. The relationship highlights how the concentration of ZnCl2 affects the micropore volume and overall structure of the biosludge, indicating that chloride, as part of a chemical compound, plays a significant role in the chemical treatment process. However, the term 'chemicals' is used broadly to refer to various substances involved in the process without a specific focus on chloride beyond its role in ZnCl2."
