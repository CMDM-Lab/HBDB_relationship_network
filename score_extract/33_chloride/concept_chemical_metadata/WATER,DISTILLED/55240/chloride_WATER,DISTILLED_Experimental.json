    "summary": "In this context, chloride and distilled water are mentioned in the process of washing and extracting polymer beads. Distilled water is used as a solvent in the washing process, which may help remove impurities, including chloride ions, from the polymer beads. However, there is no direct discussion of the chemical interaction or specific relevance of chloride in relation to distilled water beyond its incidental mention in the washing procedure."
