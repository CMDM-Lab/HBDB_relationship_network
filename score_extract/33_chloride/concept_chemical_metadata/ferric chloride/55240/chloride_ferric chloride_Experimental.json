    "summary": "In this context, chloride is indirectly related to ferric chloride through the process of polymer bead modification. Ferric chloride, which contains chloride ions, is used as a reagent in the post-crosslinking reaction of the polymer beads. The presence of ferric chloride suggests that chloride plays a role in the chemical interactions during the modification process, although the specific role of chloride itself is not detailed."
