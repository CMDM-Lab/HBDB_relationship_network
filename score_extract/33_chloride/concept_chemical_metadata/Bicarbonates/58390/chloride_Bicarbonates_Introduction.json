    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Clâˆ’) and bicarbonates (HCO3âˆ’) are both involved in the synaptic currents mediated by GABAA receptors, which are crucial for GABAergic signaling in neurons. Their concentrations influence whether GABA binding results in hyperpolarization or depolarization of the neuron. Changes in Clâˆ’ homeostasis can affect the role of bicarbonates in this signaling pathway, particularly in the context of epilepsy, where alterations in these ions can switch the signaling dynamics."
