    "summary": "In this context, chloride is directly linked to ion transport mechanisms in airway epithelial cells, particularly through the regulation of CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) and CaCC (Calcium-activated Chloride Channels). The study investigates how exercise and pharmacological agents like albuterol affect chloride transport, hypothesizing that exercise may enhance chloride transport more effectively than albuterol. This indicates a significant role of chloride in the overall ion transport processes critical for lung function, especially in individuals with cystic fibrosis."
