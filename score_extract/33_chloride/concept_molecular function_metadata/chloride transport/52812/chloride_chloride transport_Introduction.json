    "summary": "In this context, chloride and chloride transport are directly related as the study investigates the regulation of chloride ions in the airway through various measurement techniques. The research hypothesizes that exercise will enhance chloride transport, as measured by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and nasal potential difference (NPD), indicating a significant role of chloride in respiratory ion transport mechanisms, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF)."
