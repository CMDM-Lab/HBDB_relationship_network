    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Cl−) is linked to exocytosis through the activation of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCC), which provide a CFTR-independent mechanism for Cl− secretion. The study discusses how purinergic stimulation can enhance Cl− secretion and inhibit epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, suggesting a role for chloride in the regulation of ion transport in airway epithelial cells, particularly in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This relationship highlights the importance of chloride in cellular processes related to exocytosis and ion regulation."
