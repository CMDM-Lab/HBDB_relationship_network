    "summary": "In this context, chloride is quantified in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collected from subjects during cycling. The study details the methodology for measuring chloride levels, including the calculation of net chloride efflux, which accounts for ion transport dynamics during exhalation. This indicates a direct relationship between chloride levels and the process of exhalation, particularly in the context of respiratory physiology and ion transport mechanisms."
