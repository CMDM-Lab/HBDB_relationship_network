    "summary": "In this context, chloride is discussed in relation to its transport regulation in airway epithelial cells, particularly through the CFTR and CaCC pathways. The study aims to compare the effects of exercise and albuterol on chloride regulation, hypothesizing that exercise may enhance chloride transport more effectively than pharmacological intervention. This indicates a significant relationship between chloride and its regulation mechanisms in the context of lung function and cystic fibrosis treatment."
