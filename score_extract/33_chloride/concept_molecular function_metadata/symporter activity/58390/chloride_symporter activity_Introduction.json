    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Clâˆ’) is crucial for GABAergic signaling, with its homeostasis influenced by symporter activity. The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) increases intracellular Clâˆ’, promoting depolarization, while the K-Cl cotransporter (KCC2) extrudes Clâˆ’, facilitating hyperpolarization. The balance of these transporters is essential for proper neuronal function and is regulated during development, affecting GABA responses in neurons."
