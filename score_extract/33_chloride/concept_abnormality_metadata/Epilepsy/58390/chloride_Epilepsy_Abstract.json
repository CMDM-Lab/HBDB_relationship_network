    "summary": "In this context, chloride (Clâˆ’) homeostasis is implicated in the generation of epileptic activities, particularly in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis. The study investigates whether alterations in Clâˆ’ levels affect GABAergic signaling, which is crucial for inhibitory neurotransmission. The findings suggest that disrupted Clâˆ’ homeostasis may contribute to abnormal neuronal excitability and spontaneous interictal-like activity in the brain tissue of epilepsy patients."
