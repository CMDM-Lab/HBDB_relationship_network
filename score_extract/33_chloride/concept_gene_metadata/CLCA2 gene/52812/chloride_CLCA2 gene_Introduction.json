    "summary": "In this context, chloride is discussed in relation to ion transport mechanisms in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), where the CLCA2 gene is implicated in the regulation of chloride channels. The study examines how exercise and albuterol affect chloride transport, suggesting that the CLCA2 gene may play a role in modulating chloride levels in the airway, which is critical for maintaining proper lung function in CF patients. However, the direct relationship between chloride levels and the CLCA2 gene is not explicitly detailed in the provided context."
