    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is linked to pulmonary inflammation in workers exposed to its poorly soluble forms, suggesting a potential association with respiratory conditions such as pneumonia. The study indicates that exposure to beryllium may trigger inflammatory responses, including the release of TNF-Î±, which could contribute to lung-related diseases. However, the direct relationship between beryllium exposure and pneumonia is not explicitly established, necessitating further research to confirm these findings."
