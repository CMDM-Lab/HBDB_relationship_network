    "summary": "In this context, beryllium (Be) is directly linked to chronic beryllium disease (CBD), also known as berylliosis, which is a granulomatous lung disorder that arises after sensitization to Be. The text discusses the immunological mechanisms involved in CBD, including Be-specific hypersensitivity and the role of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and Th1-type cytokines in the inflammatory response. This establishes a clear and significant relationship between beryllium exposure and the development of chronic berylliosis, highlighting the health risks associated with Be exposure in various industries."
