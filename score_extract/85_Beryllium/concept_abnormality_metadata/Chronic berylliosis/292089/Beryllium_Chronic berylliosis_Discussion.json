    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is directly linked to chronic berylliosis, a condition characterized by granulomatous inflammation in the lungs due to beryllium exposure. The activation of CD4+ T cells in response to beryllium antigens leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î±, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic berylliosis. The study highlights the importance of understanding inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers in assessing lung pathobiology related to beryllium exposure."
