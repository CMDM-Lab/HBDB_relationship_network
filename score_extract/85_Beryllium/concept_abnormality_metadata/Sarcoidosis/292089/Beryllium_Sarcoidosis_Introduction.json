    "summary": "In this context, beryllium (Be) is linked to sarcoidosis through its role in causing chronic beryllium disease (CBD), which resembles sarcoidosis. Both conditions involve granulomatous inflammation in the lungs, and CBD requires prior sensitization to beryllium. The immunological responses in CBD, characterized by CD4+ T-lymphocyte activation and Th1 cytokine production, parallel those observed in sarcoidosis, indicating a significant relationship between beryllium exposure and the development of sarcoidosis-like symptoms."
