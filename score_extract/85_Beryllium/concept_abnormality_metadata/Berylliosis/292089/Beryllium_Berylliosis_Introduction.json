    "summary": "In this context, beryllium (Be) is directly linked to berylliosis, a chronic granulomatous lung disease that arises from exposure to beryllium and its compounds. The text describes how sensitization to beryllium leads to an immune response characterized by CD4+ T-lymphocyte activation and Th1-type cytokine production, resulting in granulomatous inflammation in the lungs. This establishes a clear and critical relationship between beryllium exposure and the development of berylliosis, highlighting the disease's dependence on prior sensitization to the metal."
