    "summary": "In this context, beryllium (Be) is directly linked to granulomatous disorders, specifically chronic beryllium disease (CBD), which is characterized by granulomatous inflammation in the lungs. The disease arises after sensitization to beryllium, leading to immune responses involving CD4+ T-lymphocytes and Th1-type cytokines, which contribute to the formation of granulomas. This highlights a clear and significant relationship between beryllium exposure and the development of granulomatous disorders."
