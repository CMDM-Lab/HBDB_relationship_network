    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is linked to immunotoxicity through its role in chronic beryllium disease (CBD), where exposure leads to granulomatous inflammation in the lungs and activation of CD4+ T cells. The release of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-α, is associated with beryllium exposure, indicating a clear immunotoxic effect. Experimental studies further support this relationship by demonstrating varying cytokine responses based on the chemical form of beryllium, with certain forms causing greater pulmonary toxicity. The study highlights a significant correlation between occupational exposure duration and increased TNF-α levels, underscoring beryllium's immunotoxic potential."
