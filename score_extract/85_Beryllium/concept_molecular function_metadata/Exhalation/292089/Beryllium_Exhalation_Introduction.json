    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is analyzed as a potential biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of workers exposed to poorly soluble forms of beryllium in machining industries. The study aims to investigate the correlation between beryllium concentrations in EBC and pulmonary inflammation, highlighting the significance of exhalation as a method for assessing respiratory effects due to beryllium exposure. This suggests a direct relationship between beryllium exposure and its measurable presence in exhaled breath, indicating potential health implications for workers."
