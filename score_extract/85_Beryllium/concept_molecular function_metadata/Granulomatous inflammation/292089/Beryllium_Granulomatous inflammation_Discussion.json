    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is linked to granulomatous inflammation through its role in chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The presence of beryllium antigens activates CD4+ T cells, which release proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-Î±, leading to the development of granulomatous inflammation in the lungs. This relationship highlights the immunotoxic effects of beryllium exposure and its association with lung pathobiology."
