    "summary": "In this context, beryllium exposure is linked to respiratory health, particularly through its impact on lung deposition of fine particles. The study highlights that machining beryllium generates small particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs, potentially leading to increased levels of inflammatory markers like TNF-Î± in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). This suggests a significant relationship between beryllium exposure and respiratory effects, particularly in the context of chronic beryllium disease (CBD)."
