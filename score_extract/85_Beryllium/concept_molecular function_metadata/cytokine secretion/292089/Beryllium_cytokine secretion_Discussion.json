    "summary": "In this context, beryllium exposure is linked to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-Î±, in patients with chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The activation of CD4+ T cells in response to beryllium antigens leads to increased cytokine production, indicating a direct relationship between beryllium exposure and cytokine secretion. Experimental studies further support this connection by demonstrating varying patterns of cytokine secretion based on the chemical form of beryllium, with certain forms causing greater pulmonary toxicity and cytokine release."
