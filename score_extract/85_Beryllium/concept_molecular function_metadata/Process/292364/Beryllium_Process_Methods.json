    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is associated with various processes and job descriptions within an industrial hygiene framework. The methodology developed for exposure assessment involves categorizing beryllium based on its chemical and physical forms as they relate to specific processes and job roles. This indicates that the handling and exposure to beryllium are influenced by the processes in which it is involved, highlighting the importance of process-related factors in assessing beryllium exposure risks."
