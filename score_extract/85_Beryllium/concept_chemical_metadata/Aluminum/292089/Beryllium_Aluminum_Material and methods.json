    "summary": "In this context, beryllium and aluminum are related through their presence in specific alloys used in machining industries. The study examines the effects of occupational exposure to poorly soluble forms of beryllium, particularly in alloys that also contain aluminum. The focus is on the health impacts of beryllium exposure, with aluminum being a component of some beryllium alloys, indicating a potential interaction in occupational settings. However, the relationship is primarily centered on beryllium's effects rather than a direct interaction between the two metals."
