    "summary": "In this context, beryllium and aluminum are both mentioned in relation to occupational exposure in a primary aluminum production plant. The study focuses on the quantification of beryllium in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of workers, highlighting the potential health effects of beryllium exposure. While aluminum is referenced as part of the production environment, there is no direct discussion of a relationship between beryllium and aluminum in terms of their biochemical interactions or health impacts, making their connection indirect and primarily contextual."
