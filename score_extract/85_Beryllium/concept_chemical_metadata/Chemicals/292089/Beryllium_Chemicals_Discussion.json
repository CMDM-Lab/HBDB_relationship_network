    "summary": "In this context, beryllium is discussed as a specific chemical that induces inflammatory responses, particularly in chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The relationship is highlighted through the examination of cytokine release, particularly TNF-Î±, in response to different chemical forms of beryllium. The study emphasizes the toxicological effects of beryllium compounds, linking them to immune responses and pulmonary toxicity, thus establishing a clear connection between beryllium as a chemical and its biological impact."
