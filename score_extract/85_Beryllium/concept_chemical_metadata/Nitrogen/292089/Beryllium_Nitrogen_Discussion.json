    "summary": "In this context, beryllium and nitrogen are mentioned in relation to a study on exhaled biomarkers in workers exposed to beryllium. While the study found a significant relationship between cumulative beryllium exposure and TNF-Î± levels, it did not establish any significant relationships between beryllium exposure and nitrogen reactive species, including both volatile and nonvolatile nitrogen intermediates. This indicates that while both terms are present, their direct relationship is weak and not supported by the findings."
