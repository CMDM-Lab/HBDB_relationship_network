    "summary": "In this context, beryllium (Be) is discussed as a specific metal that workers are exposed to during machining tasks involving various metal alloys. The study focuses on assessing exposure to beryllium in relation to other metals and pneumotoxicants, indicating that beryllium is categorized within the broader group of metals that can pose respiratory health risks. However, the relationship is primarily about exposure assessment rather than a detailed interaction between beryllium and other metals."
