    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its biodegradation, which is potentially inhibited by the presence of BTEX compounds. While the studies referenced suggest various forms of inhibition (substrate, by-product, and competitive), the specific inhibitory effects on MTBE biodegradation were not observed in the filters during the study. This indicates a complex relationship where inhibitors may not always lead to expected outcomes in biodegradation processes."
