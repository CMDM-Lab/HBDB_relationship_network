    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly discussed in relation to stereochemistry. The focus is primarily on the environmental behavior and biodegradation of various organic compounds, including BTEX and MTBE, without any mention of stereochemical aspects or specific interactions involving 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane. Thus, the relationship between the two terms is not established."
