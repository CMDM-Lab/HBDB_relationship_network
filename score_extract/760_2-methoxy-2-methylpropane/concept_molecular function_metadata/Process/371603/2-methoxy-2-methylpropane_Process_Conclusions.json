    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to the 'Process' of groundwater remediation technology aimed at treating contaminants like MTBE and benzene. While the term 'Process' encompasses various methods and mechanisms for remediation, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not specifically discussed as part of the remediation techniques or microbial processes involved. Its mention is more about the broader category of organic contaminants rather than a direct relationship with the remediation process itself."
