    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the process described involves the analysis of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) in water samples using solid-phase micro extraction (SPME) and gas chromatography (GC). The focus is on the analytical process for determining MTBE concentration rather than any specific relationship with 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane. Therefore, the connection between the two terms is weak and primarily coincidental."
