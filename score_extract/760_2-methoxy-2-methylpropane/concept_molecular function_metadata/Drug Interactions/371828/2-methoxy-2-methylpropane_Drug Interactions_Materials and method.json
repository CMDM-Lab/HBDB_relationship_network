    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is mentioned in relation to adsorption experiments, but there is no direct discussion of its role in drug interactions. The focus is primarily on the physical properties and behavior of MTBE in adsorption processes rather than its pharmacological implications or interactions with drugs. Therefore, the relationship between MTBE and drug interactions is not established or explored in this context."
