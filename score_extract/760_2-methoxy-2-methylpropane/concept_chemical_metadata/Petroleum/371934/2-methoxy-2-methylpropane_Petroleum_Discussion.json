    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to petroleum through its mention as a component of gasoline, which is derived from petroleum. The study discusses the levels of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) in gasoline, which is a fuel additive, and how it affects exposure levels in vehicles. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relevance between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and petroleum beyond their association in fuel composition."
