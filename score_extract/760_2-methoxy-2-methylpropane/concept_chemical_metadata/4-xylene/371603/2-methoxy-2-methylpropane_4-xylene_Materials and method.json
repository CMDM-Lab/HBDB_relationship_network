    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a broader analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and effluents. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships. They are included in a list of compounds analyzed for their presence in environmental samples, indicating they are part of the same study but without any detailed connection between them."
