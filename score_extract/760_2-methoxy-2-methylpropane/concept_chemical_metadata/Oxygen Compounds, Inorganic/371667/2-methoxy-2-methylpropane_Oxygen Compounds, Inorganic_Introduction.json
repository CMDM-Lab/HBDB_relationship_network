    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to inorganic oxygen compounds through the discussion of oxygen's role in enhancing biodegradation rates of contaminants in groundwater. While the text emphasizes the importance of oxygen for biodegradation processes, it does not specifically link 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane to inorganic oxygen compounds or detail their interaction. Instead, it focuses on the broader context of oxygen supply challenges in contaminated aquifers."
