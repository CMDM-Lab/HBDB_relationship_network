    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned in relation to mordenite, which is used as an adsorbent in the study. Mordenite is selected for its comparable aperture size to MTBE, indicating its role in adsorption processes. However, there is no specific discussion of how 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane interacts with or is affected by mordenite, leading to a lack of direct relevance between the two terms."
