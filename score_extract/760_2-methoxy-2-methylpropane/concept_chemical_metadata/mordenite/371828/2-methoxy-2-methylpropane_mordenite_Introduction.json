    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to mordenite through the study of adsorption processes for removing MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) from contaminated water. Mordenite, a type of zeolite, is one of the adsorbents evaluated for its effectiveness in adsorbing MTBE, although 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned as a subject of study. The focus is primarily on the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium of MTBE on mordenite and other carbonaceous resins."
