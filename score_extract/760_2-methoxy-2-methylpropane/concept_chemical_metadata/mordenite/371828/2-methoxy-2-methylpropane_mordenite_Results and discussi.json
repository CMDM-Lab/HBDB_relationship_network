    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to mordenite through the study of adsorption kinetics of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) onto mordenite. While 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not explicitly mentioned in relation to mordenite, the focus on adsorption kinetics suggests a broader investigation of how various organic compounds, potentially including 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, interact with mordenite as an adsorbent material. However, the specific relationship between the two terms is not detailed."
