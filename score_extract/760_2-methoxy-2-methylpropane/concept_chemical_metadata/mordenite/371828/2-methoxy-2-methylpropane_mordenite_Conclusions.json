    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) and mordenite are related through their roles in adsorption processes. The study compares the adsorption kinetics of MTBE onto mordenite zeolite and carbonaceous resins, highlighting that mordenite's performance is influenced by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). While both substances are involved in the adsorption process, the context does not provide a direct interaction or significant functional relationship between them beyond their roles as adsorbate and adsorbent."
