    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as organic contaminants of environmental concern, particularly in groundwater systems. However, the text primarily focuses on the biodegradation and removal mechanisms of other compounds like benzene and MTBE, without detailing any specific interactions or comparative significance between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is more about their classification as pollutants rather than a direct relationship."
