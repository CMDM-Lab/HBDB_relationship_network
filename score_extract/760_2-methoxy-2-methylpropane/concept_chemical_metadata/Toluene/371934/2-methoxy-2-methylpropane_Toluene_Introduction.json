    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as components of gasoline and solvents, with toluene specifically noted for its neurotoxic effects. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not directly discussed, and they are primarily referenced in the context of exposure studies related to gasoline emissions. Their connection is more about their presence in similar environments rather than any specific interaction or functional relationship."
