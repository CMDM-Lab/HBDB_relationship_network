    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in passenger cars. However, the analysis focuses primarily on the concentration levels of toluene and other aromatic compounds in relation to car model year and size, without detailing any specific interaction or relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is more about their presence in the same study rather than a direct connection."
