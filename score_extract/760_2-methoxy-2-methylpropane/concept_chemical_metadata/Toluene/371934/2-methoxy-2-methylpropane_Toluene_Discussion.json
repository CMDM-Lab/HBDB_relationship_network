    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be present in urban environments, particularly in vehicle interiors during commutes. However, the context does not provide any specific interaction or comparative analysis between the two compounds, focusing instead on their individual presence in air quality studies. Thus, their relationship is not explicitly defined beyond being part of the same environmental study."
