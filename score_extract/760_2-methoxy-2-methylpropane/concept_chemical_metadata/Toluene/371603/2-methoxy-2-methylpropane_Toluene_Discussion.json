    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are mentioned as co-contaminants that may influence the biodegradation of MTBE. The presence of toluene, along with other BTEX compounds, is suggested to inhibit the biodegradation process of MTBE, potentially due to competitive inhibition or the production of by-products. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene themselves."
