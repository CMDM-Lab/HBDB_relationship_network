    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as aromatic hydrocarbons present in the influent groundwater and effluents of a multi-stage filtration system. However, there is no direct discussion of their interactions or specific roles in the treatment process.
