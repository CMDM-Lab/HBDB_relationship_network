    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as aromatic hydrocarbons analyzed in groundwater samples using headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction; they are simply part of a broader analysis of various compounds, including degradation products of MTBE. Their mention is coincidental rather than indicative of a significant connection."
