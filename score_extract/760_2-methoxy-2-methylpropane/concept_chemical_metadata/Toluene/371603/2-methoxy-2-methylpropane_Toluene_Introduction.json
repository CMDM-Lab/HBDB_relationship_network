    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as components of BTEX compounds, which are common groundwater contaminants. However, the text primarily focuses on the environmental impact and degradation of MTBE, with no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is more about their classification as contaminants rather than any functional or chemical relationship."
