    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be present in the air surrounding low- and high-floor apartments due to motor vehicle emissions and other sources. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly discussed, and they are presented as part of a broader investigation into VOC exposure rather than having a direct interaction or comparison in the study."
