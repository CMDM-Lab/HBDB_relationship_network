    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in indoor air samples. However, the text primarily focuses on the concentrations of toluene and other VOCs in low- and high-floor apartments, without detailing any specific interaction or relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene. Their mention is coincidental, as they are part of a broader discussion on VOC levels in residential settings."
