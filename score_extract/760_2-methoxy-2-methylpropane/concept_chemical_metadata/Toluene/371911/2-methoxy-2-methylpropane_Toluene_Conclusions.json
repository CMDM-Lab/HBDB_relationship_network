    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to indoor air pollution in residential settings. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are primarily noted for their presence in the air rather than any direct interaction or comparative analysis. The focus is on their concentrations in different apartment settings rather than their chemical properties or effects on health."
