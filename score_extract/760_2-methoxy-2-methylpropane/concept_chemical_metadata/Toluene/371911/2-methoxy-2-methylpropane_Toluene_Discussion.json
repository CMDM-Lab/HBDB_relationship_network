    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with vehicle emissions and indoor air quality. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are not shown to interact or influence each other directly. Instead, they are part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations in residential areas near roadways and parking lots, indicating their presence in similar environmental contexts without a specific connection."
