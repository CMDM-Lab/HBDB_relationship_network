    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its adsorption kinetics on mordenite zeolite compared to carbonaceous resins. The study highlights how the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) affects the adsorption process, indicating that zeolites like mordenite can influence the transport and adsorption behavior of MTBE in natural waters. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the adsorption characteristics rather than a direct chemical interaction between MTBE and zeolites."
