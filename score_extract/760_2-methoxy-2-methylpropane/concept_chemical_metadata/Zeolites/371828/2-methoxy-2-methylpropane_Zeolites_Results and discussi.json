    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to zeolites through the discussion of adsorption kinetics and molecular diffusivity within microporous adsorbents. While zeolites, such as mordenite, are mentioned as adsorbents for substances like MTBE, the specific interaction or relevance of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane to zeolites is not explicitly detailed, indicating a general connection rather than a direct relationship."
