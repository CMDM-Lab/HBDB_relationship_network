    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to zeolites through their roles as adsorbates and adsorbents in water treatment processes. The study mentions mordenite zeolite as an adsorbent with a suitable pore size for adsorbing compounds like MTBE, which may include 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane. However, there is no direct interaction or specific analysis of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane's behavior with zeolites in the provided context."
