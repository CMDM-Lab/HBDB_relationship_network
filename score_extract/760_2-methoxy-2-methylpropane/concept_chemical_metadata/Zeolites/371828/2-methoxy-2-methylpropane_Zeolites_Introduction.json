    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane (MTBE) is discussed in relation to its adsorption behavior on zeolites, specifically mordenite, compared to carbonaceous resins. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these adsorbents in removing MTBE from contaminated water, highlighting the role of zeolites in the adsorption process. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the adsorption characteristics rather than a direct chemical interaction between MTBE and zeolites."
