    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned alongside aromatic compounds like benzene and toluene in a study analyzing in-vehicle VOC concentrations. However, there is no direct discussion of the relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the aromatic compounds. The focus is primarily on the statistical differences in VOC levels based on car model year and commute periods, without detailing how 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane interacts with or relates to the aromatic compounds."
