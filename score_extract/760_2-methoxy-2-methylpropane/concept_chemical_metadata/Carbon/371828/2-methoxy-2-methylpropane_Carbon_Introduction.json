    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is implied as a synthetic organic compound (SOC) that may be adsorbed using granular activated carbon (GAC). The discussion focuses on the effectiveness of carbon as an adsorbent for removing SOCs like MTBE from contaminated water, highlighting the role of carbon in the adsorption process rather than a direct relationship with 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane itself."
