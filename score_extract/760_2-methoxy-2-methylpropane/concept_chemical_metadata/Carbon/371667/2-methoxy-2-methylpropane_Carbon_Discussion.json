    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is discussed in relation to its biodegradation, specifically highlighting its resistance due to the presence of a tertiary carbon atom and an ether bond. The mention of carbon refers to its role as a source of energy for the MTBE-degrading Î²-proteobacterium strain L108, which utilizes fuel oxygenate ethers like MTBE as its sole carbon source. This indicates a direct relationship between the compound and carbon in the context of biodegradation processes."
