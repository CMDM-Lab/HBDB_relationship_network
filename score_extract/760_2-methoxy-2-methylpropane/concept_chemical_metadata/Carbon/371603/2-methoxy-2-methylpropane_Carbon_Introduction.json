    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly discussed, but it is implied as a compound related to the broader category of organic contaminants, which includes carbon-based compounds like benzene and MTBE. The mention of carbon primarily relates to its role in the physico-chemical properties of these compounds, particularly regarding their solubility and adsorption characteristics. However, there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon in the provided text."
