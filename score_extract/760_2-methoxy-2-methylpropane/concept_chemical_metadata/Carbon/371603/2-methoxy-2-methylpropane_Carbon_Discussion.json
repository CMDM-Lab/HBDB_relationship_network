    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to carbon through its chemical structure, which includes carbon atoms. The discussion focuses on the biodegradation of MTBE, a compound with a tertiary carbon atom, highlighting the challenges posed by its structure in enzymatic degradation. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and carbon beyond their basic chemical composition."
