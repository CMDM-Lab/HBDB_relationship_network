    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly related to hemicellulose, but both are mentioned in the broader discussion of biodegradation processes. The text suggests that auxiliary substances from coconut material, which may include hemicellulose, could potentially enhance the growth of aerobic MTBE degraders. However, there is no specific interaction or detailed relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and hemicellulose."
