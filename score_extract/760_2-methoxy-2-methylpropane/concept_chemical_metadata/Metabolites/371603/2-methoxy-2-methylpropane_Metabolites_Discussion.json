    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is indirectly related to metabolites through the discussion of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) biodegradation. The metabolites mentioned, such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF), are products of MTBE degradation, indicating that while 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly analyzed, it is part of a broader discussion on the degradation of similar compounds and their metabolites in the environment."
