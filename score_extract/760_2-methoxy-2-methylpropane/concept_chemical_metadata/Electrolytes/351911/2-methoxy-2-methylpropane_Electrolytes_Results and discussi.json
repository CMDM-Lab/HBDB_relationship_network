    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to the extraction process, where the influence of electrolytes, specifically sodium chloride, on extraction yield is tested. The addition of salt is shown to affect the extraction efficiency, indicating a relationship where electrolytes can modify the behavior of organic compounds like 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane during extraction processes. However, the specific interactions between the two are not deeply explored, focusing more on the general effect of electrolytes on extraction yields."
