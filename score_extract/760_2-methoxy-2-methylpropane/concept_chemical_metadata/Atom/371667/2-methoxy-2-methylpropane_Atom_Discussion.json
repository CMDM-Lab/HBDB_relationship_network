    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around MTBE, which contains a tertiary carbon atom and an ether bond. The term 'atom' is referenced in relation to the structure of MTBE, indicating that the chemical properties of MTBE are influenced by its atomic composition. However, there is no specific relationship established between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the concept of an atom beyond the general chemical context."
