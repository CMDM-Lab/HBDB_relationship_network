    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the performance of different filter materials, including expanded clay, in the removal of contaminants like benzene and MTBE. The relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and clay is not established, as the focus is on the efficiency of clay as a filter medium rather than any specific interaction with 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane."
