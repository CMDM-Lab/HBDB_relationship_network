    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and butyl formate are both mentioned as intermediate degradation products of MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) in the analysis of groundwater and effluents. However, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction, as they are simply listed among other compounds analyzed using headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Their mention does not imply any significant functional or chemical connection."
