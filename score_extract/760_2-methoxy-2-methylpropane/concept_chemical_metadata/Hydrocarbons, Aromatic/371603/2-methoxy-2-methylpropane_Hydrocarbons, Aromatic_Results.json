    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene and toluene, from groundwater through a multi-stage filtration system. Aromatic hydrocarbons are a category that may include various compounds, potentially including 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, but the specific relationship or interaction between them is not detailed. The focus is primarily on the treatment performance of the filtration system rather than on the properties or interactions of the individual hydrocarbons."
