    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are both mentioned as compounds selected for investigation due to their occurrence in environmental aqueous matrices and their relevance in studies related to toxicity and physicochemical behavior. However, there is no direct discussion of their specific interactions or relationships, indicating they are part of a broader category of ethers and solvents being analyzed for environmental impact."
