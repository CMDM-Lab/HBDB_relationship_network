    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and octane are both mentioned in relation to gasoline and its components. Octane is highlighted as a factor in increasing gasoline's performance, while 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly linked to octane but is implied to be part of the broader discussion on VOCs in vehicle emissions. Their relationship is indirect, as both are associated with gasoline but not specifically connected in terms of chemical interaction or functional relevance."
