    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is not directly mentioned but is implied as a potential contaminant being monitored in the air alongside benzene and MTBE. Tenax TAÂ® is used as a sorbent material for active sampling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane. The relationship is based on Tenax's role in capturing and analyzing air samples for VOCs, including 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane, but no specific interaction or detailed discussion of their relationship is provided."
