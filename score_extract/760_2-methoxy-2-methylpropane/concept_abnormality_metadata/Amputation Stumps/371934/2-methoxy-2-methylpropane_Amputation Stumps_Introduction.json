    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that individuals may be exposed to in vehicles due to gasoline emissions. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding amputation stumps, making it unclear how these two terms relate to each other.
