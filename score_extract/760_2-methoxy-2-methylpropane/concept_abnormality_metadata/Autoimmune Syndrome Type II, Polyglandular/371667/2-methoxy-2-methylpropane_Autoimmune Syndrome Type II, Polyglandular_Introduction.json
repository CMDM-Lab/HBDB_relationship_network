    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular are mentioned without any direct relationship or interaction. The context primarily discusses the environmental impact and biodegradation of various organic compounds, including BTEX and MTBE, with no reference to autoimmune conditions or their potential links to these chemicals. Thus, their mention appears coincidental rather than relevant."
