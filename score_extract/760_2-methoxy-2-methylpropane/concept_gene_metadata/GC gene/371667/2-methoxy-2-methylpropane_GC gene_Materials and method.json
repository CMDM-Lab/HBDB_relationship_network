    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned in relation to the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using gas chromatography (GC), while the GC gene is not explicitly discussed. The context focuses on the methodology for analyzing contaminants like benzene and MTBE, without establishing a direct relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the GC gene, which may refer to genetic factors influencing gas chromatography processes or microbial degradation pathways."
