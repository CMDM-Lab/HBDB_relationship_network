    "summary": "In this context, there is no direct relationship between 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the FASTK gene. The discussion focuses on the adsorption kinetics of MTBE in natural waters and the influence of NOM on this process, without any mention of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane's biological relevance or any connection to the FASTK gene, which is involved in mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism."
