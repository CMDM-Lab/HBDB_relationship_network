    "summary": "In this context, 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane is mentioned as a chemical compound analyzed in relation to the degradation products of MTBE, while the TERT gene is not discussed or connected to the analysis. There is no indication of any relationship between the chemical properties of 2-methoxy-2-methylpropane and the biological function of the TERT gene, which is typically associated with telomerase activity and cellular aging. Thus, their mention appears coincidental without any direct relevance."
