    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that may contribute to airway inflammation when reacting with ozone. However, the studies referenced do not establish a direct link between this compound and pneumonia. Instead, they focus on inflammatory markers in lung cells and the absence of significant inflammatory responses in human subjects exposed to VOC mixtures, indicating a lack of clear evidence connecting this compound to pneumonia specifically."
