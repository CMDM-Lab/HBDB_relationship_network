    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene (d-limonene) is discussed in relation to its reaction with ozone. The study assumes a pseudo-first order reaction between d-limonene and ozone, indicating that the presence of ozone influences the oxidation process of d-limonene. The measured and predicted ozone concentrations suggest a significant interaction, as the reaction leads to changes in particle number concentrations within the exposure chamber."
