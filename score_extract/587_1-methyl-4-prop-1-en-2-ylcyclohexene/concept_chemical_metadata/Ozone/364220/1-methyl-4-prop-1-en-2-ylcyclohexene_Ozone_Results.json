    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone are both involved in a study examining the effects of ozone exposure on respiratory parameters. The results indicate that ozone levels influence various respiratory metrics, such as tidal volume (VT) and total inspiratory (TI) response, but there is no direct interaction or specific relationship established between the two compounds. The study primarily focuses on ozone's effects rather than the chemical interactions with 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene."
