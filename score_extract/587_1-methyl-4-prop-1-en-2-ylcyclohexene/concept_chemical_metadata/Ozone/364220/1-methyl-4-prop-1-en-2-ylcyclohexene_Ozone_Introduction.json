    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is indirectly related to ozone through the discussion of ozone-initiated reactions with terpenes, including limonene. While the study mentions the effects of ozone on eye irritation and the generation of various reaction products, it does not provide a direct relationship or specific interaction between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone. The focus is more on the broader implications of ozone's role in reactions with volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
