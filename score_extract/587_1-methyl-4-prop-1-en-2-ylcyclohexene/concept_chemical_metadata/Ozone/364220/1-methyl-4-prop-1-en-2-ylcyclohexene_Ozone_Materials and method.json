    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone are mentioned in relation to exposure studies involving limonene and ozone mixtures. While the study discusses the effects of ozone on various parameters during exposure, it does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone. Their mention is more about their presence in the same experimental setup rather than a specific interaction or effect."
