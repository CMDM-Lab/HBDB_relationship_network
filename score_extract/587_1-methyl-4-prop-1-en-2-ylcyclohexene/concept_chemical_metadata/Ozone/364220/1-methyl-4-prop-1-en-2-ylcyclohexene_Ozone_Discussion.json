    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and ozone are indirectly related through their involvement in airway inflammation studies. The reaction products of limonene (a VOC) and ozone were shown to upregulate inflammatory markers in lung cells during acute exposure in rats. However, there is no direct mention of 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene's specific interaction with ozone or its effects on inflammation in the provided studies, indicating a lack of detailed connection between the two compounds."
