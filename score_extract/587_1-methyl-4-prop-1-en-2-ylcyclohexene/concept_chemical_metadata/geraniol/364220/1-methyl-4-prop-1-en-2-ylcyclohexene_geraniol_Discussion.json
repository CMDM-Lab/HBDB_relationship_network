    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and geraniol are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that may be present in indoor air mixtures. However, the text primarily discusses the reactions of ozone with various unsaturated VOCs, including geraniol, without establishing a direct relationship or interaction between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and geraniol. Their mention is more about their classification as VOCs rather than any specific functional or chemical relationship."
