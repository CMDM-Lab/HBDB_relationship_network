    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, commonly known as limonene, is discussed in relation to its oxidation products, which include various aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acrolein. The oxidation of limonene in the presence of ozone leads to the formation of these aldehydes, indicating a direct chemical relationship where limonene contributes to the generation of aldehydes as indoor air pollutants. This highlights the potential health implications of limonene exposure in indoor environments."
