    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is implicated in the generation of isoprene/ozone reaction products that caused significant sensory irritation in mice, evidenced by a more than 60% decrease in respiratory rate. This indicates a direct relationship between the chemical and the irritation effect, highlighting its potential as a hazard in air quality evaluations."
