    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene (a component of limonene) is indirectly related to blinking through its role in generating LOP (light-activated ozone products) when mixed with ozone. The study indicates that exposure to LOP significantly increases eye blink frequency, suggesting a physiological response to eye irritation caused by these compounds. However, the specific role of 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene in this response is not detailed, making the connection more about the broader category of compounds involved rather than a direct relationship."
