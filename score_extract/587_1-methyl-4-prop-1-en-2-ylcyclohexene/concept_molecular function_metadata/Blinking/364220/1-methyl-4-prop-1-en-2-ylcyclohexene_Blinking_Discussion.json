    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, commonly known as limonene, is associated with increased eye blinking frequency in humans when exposed to specific concentrations of limonene and ozone. The studies indicate that exposure to limonene can lead to weak eye irritation, prompting a physiological response such as increased blinking. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the effects of limonene rather than a direct interaction with blinking itself."
