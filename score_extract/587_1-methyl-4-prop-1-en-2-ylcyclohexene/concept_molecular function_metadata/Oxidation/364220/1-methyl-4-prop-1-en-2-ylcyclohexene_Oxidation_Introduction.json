    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene, commonly known as limonene, is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes when exposed to ozone. The oxidation of limonene leads to the formation of various products, including aldehydes and secondary organic aerosols, which are significant indoor air pollutants. This highlights the chemical transformation of limonene through oxidation and its implications for indoor air quality and health."
