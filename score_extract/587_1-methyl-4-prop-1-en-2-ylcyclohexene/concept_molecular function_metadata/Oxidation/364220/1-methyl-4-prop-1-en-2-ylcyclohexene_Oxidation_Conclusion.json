    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is indirectly related to oxidation through its mention alongside limonene and ozone, which are known to undergo oxidation reactions. The study discusses the sensory irritation caused by limonene oxidation products, suggesting that oxidation processes are relevant to the effects observed in the study. However, the specific relationship between 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene and oxidation is not explicitly detailed."
