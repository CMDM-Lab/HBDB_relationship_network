    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is part of a volatile organic compound (VOC) mixture that undergoes oxidation when exposed to ozone. The study highlights the sensory irritation effects of ozone-initiated oxidation products of limonene, suggesting that similar reactions may occur with other unsaturated VOCs like 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene. However, the specific oxidation pathways or products related to this compound are not detailed in the provided context."
