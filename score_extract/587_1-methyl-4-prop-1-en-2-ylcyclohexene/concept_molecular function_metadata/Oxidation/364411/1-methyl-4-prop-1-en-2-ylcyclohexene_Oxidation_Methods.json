    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene (d-limonene) is discussed in relation to its oxidation by ozone. The study assumes a pseudo-first order reaction between d-limonene and ozone, indicating that oxidation is a significant process affecting d-limonene levels in the exposure chamber. The rate constant for this oxidation reaction is provided, suggesting a clear relationship between the compound and the oxidation process it undergoes when exposed to ozone."
