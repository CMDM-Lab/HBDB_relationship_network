    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is mentioned in relation to airway inflammation caused by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their reaction products with ozone. While the study indicates that acute exposure to a mixture containing limonene and ozone resulted in upregulation of inflammatory markers in lung cells, it does not provide direct evidence linking 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene specifically to inflammation. The lack of clear association limits the strength of their relationship."
