    "summary": "In this context, 1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene is mentioned in relation to airway inflammation and the effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on lung cells. However, there is no direct discussion of transcriptional activation linked to this compound. The focus is primarily on inflammatory markers and cellular responses rather than on transcriptional mechanisms, indicating a lack of clear connection between the two terms."
