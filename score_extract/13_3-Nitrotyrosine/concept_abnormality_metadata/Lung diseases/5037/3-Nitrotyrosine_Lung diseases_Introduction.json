    "summary": "In this context, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) is linked to lung diseases through its formation from the reaction of peroxynitrite with tyrosine residues, particularly under inflammatory conditions. The presence of 3-NT has been detected in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung tissue of subjects with lung diseases, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for inflammation in conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis. Studies have shown significantly higher concentrations of 3-NT in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy individuals, suggesting a direct association between 3-NT levels and lung disease severity."
