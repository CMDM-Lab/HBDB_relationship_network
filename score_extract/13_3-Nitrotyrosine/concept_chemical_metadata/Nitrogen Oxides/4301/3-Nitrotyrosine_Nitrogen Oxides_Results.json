    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are both measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of subjects. While NOx levels correlated significantly with other markers such as protein and 8-isoprostane, there was no direct correlation between NOx and 3-nitrotyrosine levels. This suggests that while both are present in EBC, their relationship is not strongly defined within the study's findings."
