    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and protons (H+) are mentioned in relation to their presence in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. While 3-Nitrotyrosine is correlated with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other oxidative stress markers, there is no direct correlation established between 3-Nitrotyrosine and H+ concentration in EBC. This suggests that while both are measured in the same biological samples, their relationship is not significant or well-defined."
