    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine is discussed as a biological marker for inflammatory processes, with its formation potentially linked to the presence of nitrating agents such as nitrate and nitrite. The study indicates that while tyrosine can be nitrated under certain conditions, the method used did not produce additional nitrotyrosine from nitrate or nitrite under controlled pH conditions. This suggests a relationship where nitrate may influence the formation of nitrotyrosine, but the specific conditions and mechanisms are not fully elucidated."
