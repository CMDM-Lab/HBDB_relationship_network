    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine refer to the same compound, with the former being a more formal representation of the name. The text discusses the quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and emphasizes the need for accurate measurement methods. The relationship is purely semantic, as both terms denote the same biochemical marker relevant to inflammatory reactions in the airways."
