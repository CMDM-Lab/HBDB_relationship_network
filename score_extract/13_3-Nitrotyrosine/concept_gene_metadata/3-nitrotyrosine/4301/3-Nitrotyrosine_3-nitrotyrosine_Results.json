    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine refer to the same compound, indicating a potential issue with nomenclature consistency. The study discusses the detection of 3-nitrotyrosine in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and its correlation with other biomarkers, but does not differentiate between the two terms. The lack of significant findings regarding 3-nitrotyrosine levels in normal subjects versus patients suggests limited relevance in this specific context."
