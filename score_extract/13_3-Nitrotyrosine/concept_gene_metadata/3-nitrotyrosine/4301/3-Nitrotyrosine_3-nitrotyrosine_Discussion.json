    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine is mentioned as a compound that proved difficult to measure and did not contribute to the findings regarding asbestos-related disease. The text indicates that both 3-Nitrotyrosine and NOx are not useful for assessing such diseases, suggesting a lack of significant relevance or interaction between them in this specific study. The mention of 3-Nitrotyrosine appears to be more about its measurement challenges rather than a direct relationship with the disease or other factors."
