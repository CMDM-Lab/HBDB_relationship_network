    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) is discussed in relation to its calibration and analysis methods, particularly in the context of artificial synthesis. The study demonstrates the accuracy of the method used to measure 3-NT, indicating that the synthesis of nitrotyrosine was effectively tested under controlled conditions. However, the relationship between 3-NT and the broader concept of synthesis is primarily focused on the analytical methodology rather than a detailed exploration of the synthesis process itself."
