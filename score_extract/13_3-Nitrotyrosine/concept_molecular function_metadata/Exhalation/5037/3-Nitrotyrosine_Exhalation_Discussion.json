    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (NT) is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to assess its concentration levels in healthy individuals. The study emphasizes the importance of a reliable method for accurately quantifying NT in EBC, highlighting the challenges faced by immunochemical techniques. The findings suggest that NT levels in exhaled breath can serve as a potential biomarker for oxidative stress, reinforcing the relevance of exhalation as a medium for measuring this compound."
