    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) is analyzed as a biomarker in exhaled breath condensate from subjects with lung diseases, including asthma and cystic fibrosis. The studies indicate that 3-NT concentrations are significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis compared to healthy subjects, suggesting a potential link between elevated 3-NT levels in exhalation and lung disease severity. The research aims to develop a reliable method for quantifying 3-NT in exhaled breath, highlighting its relevance as a noninvasive diagnostic tool."
