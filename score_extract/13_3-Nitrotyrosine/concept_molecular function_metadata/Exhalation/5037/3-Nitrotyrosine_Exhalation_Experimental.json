    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine is analyzed in exhaled breath condensate, indicating its potential as a biomarker for oxidative stress or inflammation. The method involves solid phase extraction (SPE) to isolate 3-Nitrotyrosine from the breath samples, suggesting a direct relationship where exhalation serves as a medium for measuring this compound's levels in biological samples. This highlights the relevance of exhalation in the assessment of 3-Nitrotyrosine as a potential indicator of physiological conditions."
