    "summary": "In this context, 3-nitrotyrosine is identified as a biological marker for inflammatory processes. The text discusses methods for quantifying both free and protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine in biological materials, particularly in plasma, indicating its relevance in assessing inflammation. The increased sensitivity and specificity of detection methods further support its role in monitoring inflammatory conditions."
