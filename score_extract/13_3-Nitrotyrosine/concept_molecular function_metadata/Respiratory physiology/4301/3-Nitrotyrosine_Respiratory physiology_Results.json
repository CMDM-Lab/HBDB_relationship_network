    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine is mentioned as a biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) related to respiratory physiology. However, the study found no significant differences in 3-Nitrotyrosine levels between normal subjects and patients with asbestos-related diseases, nor any correlation with lung function or other biomarkers. This suggests limited relevance of 3-Nitrotyrosine as a marker in respiratory physiology under the conditions studied."
