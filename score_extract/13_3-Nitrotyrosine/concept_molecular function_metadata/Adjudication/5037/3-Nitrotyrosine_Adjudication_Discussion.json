    "summary": "In this context, 3-Nitrotyrosine (NT) is analyzed as a biomarker in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for monitoring inflammatory reactions. The discussion focuses on the reliability and sensitivity of a new LCâ€“MS/MS method for quantifying NT levels. However, 'adjudication' is not explicitly defined or discussed in relation to NT, indicating a lack of direct connection between the two terms."
