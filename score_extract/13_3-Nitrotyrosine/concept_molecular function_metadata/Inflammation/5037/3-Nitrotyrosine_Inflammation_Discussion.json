    "summary": "In this context, 3-nitrotyrosine is highlighted as a biomarker for monitoring inflammatory reactions in the airways. The study emphasizes the need for accurate quantification of 3-nitrotyrosine using a reliable LCâ€“MS/MS method, suggesting its relevance in assessing inflammation. Improved standardization of sampling conditions is recommended for effective biological monitoring, indicating a direct link between 3-nitrotyrosine levels and inflammatory processes."
