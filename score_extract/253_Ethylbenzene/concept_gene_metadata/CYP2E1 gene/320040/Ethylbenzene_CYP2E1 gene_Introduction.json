    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned alongside toluene as a volatile organic compound (VOC) to be studied for its impact on CYP2E1 activity in tannery workers. The investigation aims to assess how occupational exposure to VOCs, including ethylbenzene, affects CYP2E1 gene expression and enzymatic activity. While the study highlights the relevance of CYP2E1 in metabolizing VOCs, it does not provide specific data on ethylbenzene's direct effects, focusing instead on the broader implications of VOC exposure on CYP2E1 activity."
