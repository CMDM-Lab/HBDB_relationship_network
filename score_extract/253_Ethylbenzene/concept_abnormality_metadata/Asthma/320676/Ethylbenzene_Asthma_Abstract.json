    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a significant risk factor for asthma among children, with exposure levels being notably higher in cases compared to controls. The study indicates that for every 10 unit increase in ethylbenzene concentration, the risk of developing asthma increases, highlighting a direct correlation between ethylbenzene exposure and asthma incidence. This suggests that ethylbenzene, along with other VOCs, may contribute to the development of asthma in children."
