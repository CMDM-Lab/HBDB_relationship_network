    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a significant risk factor for asthma, particularly among children exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study indicates that exposure to ethylbenzene, along with other VOCs like benzene and toluene, correlates with increased odds ratios (ORs) for developing asthma. Specifically, ethylbenzene exposure contributes to a heightened risk, emphasizing its relevance in indoor air quality and public health concerns regarding asthma prevalence."
