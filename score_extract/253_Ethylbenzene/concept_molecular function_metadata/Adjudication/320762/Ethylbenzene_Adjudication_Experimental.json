    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as an internal standard for the analysis of BTEX and other alkylbenzenes during gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. However, there is no discussion or indication of a relationship between ethylbenzene and adjudication, which appears to be unrelated to the chemical analysis process described."
