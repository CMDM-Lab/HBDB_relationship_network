    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to its removal efficiency from plant cuticles, while dark adaptation refers to the process of leaves adjusting to darkness before measuring photosynthetic efficiency. However, there is no direct connection or interaction discussed between ethylbenzene and dark adaptation, as they are part of separate experimental procedures without a clear relationship."
