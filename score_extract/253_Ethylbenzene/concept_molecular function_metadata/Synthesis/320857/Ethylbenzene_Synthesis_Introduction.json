    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned primarily in relation to its toxicological effects and exposure risks, particularly concerning hearing and kidney damage in animals. However, there is no direct discussion of its role in synthesis or any specific synthesis processes involving ethylbenzene. The mention of synthesis appears to be incidental, lacking a clear connection to ethylbenzene's chemical properties or applications in synthesis."
