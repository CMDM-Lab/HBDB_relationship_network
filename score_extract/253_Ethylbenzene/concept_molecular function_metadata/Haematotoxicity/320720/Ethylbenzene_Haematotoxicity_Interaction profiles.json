    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its potential hematotoxicity, particularly in the presence of other BTEX compounds like benzene and toluene. The text suggests that while ethylbenzene may not significantly influence the hematotoxic effects of benzene, it could potentially reduce these effects through competitive metabolic interactions. However, the available toxicity data regarding these interactions are indeterminate, indicating a lack of conclusive evidence on ethylbenzene's hematotoxicity."
