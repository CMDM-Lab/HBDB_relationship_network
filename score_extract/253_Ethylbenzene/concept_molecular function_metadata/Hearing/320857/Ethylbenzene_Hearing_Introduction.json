    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is linked to hearing through its potential toxic effects on the inner ear. Short-term exposure to high levels can cause dizziness and vertigo, while long-term exposure to lower levels has been associated with irreversible damage to hearing in animals. This suggests a significant relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and auditory health."
