    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is associated with irritation, as indicated by the American Conference of Industrial Hygienists' recommendation of a threshold limit value (TLV-TWA) of 100 ppm for ethylbenzene based on its potential to cause irritation and central nervous system effects. This suggests that exposure to ethylbenzene can lead to irritation of the respiratory tract, eyes, and skin, highlighting its relevance in occupational health and safety discussions."
