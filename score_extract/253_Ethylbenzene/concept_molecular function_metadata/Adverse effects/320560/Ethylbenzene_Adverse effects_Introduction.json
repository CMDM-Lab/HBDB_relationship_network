    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is linked to adverse effects, specifically respiratory and kidney issues, as noted in studies by NTP (1999) and ATSDR (2003). The mention of chronic exposure to ethylbenzene highlights its potential health risks, aligning it with other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have documented adverse effects on human health. This establishes a clear connection between ethylbenzene and its negative health impacts."
