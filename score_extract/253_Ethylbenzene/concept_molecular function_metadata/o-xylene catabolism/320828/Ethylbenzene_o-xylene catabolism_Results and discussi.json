    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and o-xylene are both mentioned as substrates undergoing biodegradation by microbial strains Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. The study focuses on modeling the effects of heavy metals on the removal kinetics of these alkylbenzenes, indicating a relationship where both compounds are part of the same degradation process. However, the specific catabolism of o-xylene is not detailed in relation to ethylbenzene, limiting the depth of their interaction."
