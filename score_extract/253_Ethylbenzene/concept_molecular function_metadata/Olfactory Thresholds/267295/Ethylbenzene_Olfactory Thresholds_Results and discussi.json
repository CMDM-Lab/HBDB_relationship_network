    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to olfactory thresholds, indicating that its concentration in the emissions from plastic waste recycling plants exceeded human olfactory thresholds. This suggests that ethylbenzene contributes significantly to the odor perceived in these environments, highlighting its relevance in assessing potential health risks associated with exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs)."
