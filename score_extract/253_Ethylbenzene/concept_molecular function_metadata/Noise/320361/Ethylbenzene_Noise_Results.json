    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to ambient air concentration measurements of BTEX compounds, which include benzene, toluene, and xylene. However, there is no direct discussion or connection established between ethylbenzene and noise. The mention of noise appears to be incidental, as the focus is primarily on the chemical analysis rather than any auditory implications or interactions with ethylbenzene."
