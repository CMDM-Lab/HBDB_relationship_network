    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is linked to respiratory physiology through its association with airway inflammation and lung function deterioration. The study indicates that exposure to ethylbenzene, along with other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), is related to negative spirometric outcomes and increased asthma risk. This suggests that ethylbenzene may contribute to respiratory issues, highlighting its relevance in respiratory health assessments."
