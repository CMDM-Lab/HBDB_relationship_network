    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to exposure from various fumes, but there is no direct discussion of its specific effects on respiration. The study notes that breathing fumes from different sources, including fingernail polish and paint thinner, was associated with increased levels of certain volatile organic compounds, but ethylbenzene's impact on respiratory health is not explicitly addressed. Thus, while ethylbenzene is part of the broader discussion on inhalation exposure, its relationship to respiration remains unclear."
