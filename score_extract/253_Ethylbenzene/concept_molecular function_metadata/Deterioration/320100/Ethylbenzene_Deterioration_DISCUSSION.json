    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) associated with lung function deterioration and airway inflammation. The study suggests a link between exposure to ethylbenzene and negative respiratory outcomes, indicating that it may contribute to the deterioration of lung function, particularly in relation to asthma symptoms. This highlights ethylbenzene's potential role as a risk factor for respiratory health issues."
