    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to the modeling of kinetics for the removal of aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of heavy metals, which can act as inhibitors. The text discusses how the presence of heavy metals, such as zinc, can inhibit the growth and metabolic activity of bacteria that degrade VOCs like ethylbenzene. This suggests that inhibitors, in this case heavy metals, can negatively impact the biodegradation process of ethylbenzene by affecting microbial growth kinetics."
