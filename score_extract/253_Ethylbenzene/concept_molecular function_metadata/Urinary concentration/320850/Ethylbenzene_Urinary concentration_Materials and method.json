    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is analyzed as part of a biological monitoring study where its concentration in urine is measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The study aims to assess the urinary concentration of BTEX compounds, including ethylbenzene, to evaluate exposure levels in individuals. The relationship is significant as it highlights the use of urinary concentration as a biomarker for ethylbenzene exposure."
