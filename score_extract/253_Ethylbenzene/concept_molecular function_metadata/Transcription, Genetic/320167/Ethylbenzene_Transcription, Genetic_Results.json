    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that affect gene expression in rat whole blood. The study highlights the transcriptional levels of several genes that were significantly altered following exposure to EB, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and genetic transcription changes. The analysis involved quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) to validate the expression of these genes, demonstrating that EB exposure can lead to significant transcriptional deregulation in specific pathways."
