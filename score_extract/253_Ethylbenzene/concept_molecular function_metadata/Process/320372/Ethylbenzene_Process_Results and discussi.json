    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its partitioning behavior in a polymer phase during a solid-liquid two-phase partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) process. The study highlights how ethylbenzene, along with other BTEX compounds, exhibits specific partition coefficients that influence its concentration in both the polymer and aqueous phases. This indicates that the process of using polymers in TPPB systems significantly enhances the uptake and performance of ethylbenzene removal compared to traditional single-phase reactors."
