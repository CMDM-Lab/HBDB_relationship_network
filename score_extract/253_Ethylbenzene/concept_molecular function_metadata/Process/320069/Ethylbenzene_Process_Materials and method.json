    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is part of a treatment process involving ozonation and adsorption to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from an aqueous solution. The process includes the stripping of BTEX compounds, including ethylbenzene, from the liquid phase, indicating its role in the overall treatment procedure. However, the specific interactions or mechanisms involving ethylbenzene within the process are not elaborated upon."
