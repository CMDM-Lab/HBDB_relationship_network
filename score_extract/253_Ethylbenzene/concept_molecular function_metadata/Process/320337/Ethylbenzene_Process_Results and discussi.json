    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted during the biostabilization process of municipal solid waste (MSW). The study highlights the concentration levels of ethylbenzene alongside other VOCs like toluene and xylene, indicating its relevance in the emissions profile of the process. However, there is no detailed discussion of how ethylbenzene specifically interacts with or affects the biostabilization process itself."
