    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is one of the components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) that undergoes a biodegradation process by bacteria sourced from a petroleum refinery's raw effluent. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this biodegradation process on reducing the concentration of ethylbenzene and other BTEX compounds, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene and the biodegradation process being assessed."
