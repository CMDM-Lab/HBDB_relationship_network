    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the analytes measured in biological monitoring of BTEX compounds in urine. The calibration curves for quantifying BTEX concentrations, including ethylbenzene, are established using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Ethylbenzene is treated as a specific analyte within the broader analysis of BTEX compounds, indicating its relevance in the study of exposure levels in biological samples."
