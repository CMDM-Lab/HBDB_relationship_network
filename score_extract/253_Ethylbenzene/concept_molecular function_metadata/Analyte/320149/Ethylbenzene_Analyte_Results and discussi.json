    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) whose interaction with silica surfaces is compared to other compounds in the BTEX group. The term 'analyte' refers to the substances being measured or analyzed, which includes ethylbenzene among others. The context indicates that ethylbenzene's concentration in the air is being evaluated, showing a significant decrease in its absolute amount compared to other VOCs. However, the relationship is primarily about its role as an analyte in the study rather than a direct interaction."
