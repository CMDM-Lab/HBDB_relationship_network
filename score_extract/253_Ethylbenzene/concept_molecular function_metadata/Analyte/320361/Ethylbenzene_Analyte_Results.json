    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as an analyte in the measurement of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) ambient air concentrations. The results indicate that ethylbenzene was detected at levels above the calibration curve's linear response, suggesting its significance as a target compound in air quality assessments. However, the relationship is primarily focused on its role as a measured substance rather than any deeper interaction or functional significance."
