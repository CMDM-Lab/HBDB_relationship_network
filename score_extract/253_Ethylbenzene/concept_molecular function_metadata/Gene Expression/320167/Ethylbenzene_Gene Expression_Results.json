    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is linked to gene expression through a study examining the effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on transcriptional changes in rat whole blood. The analysis identified differentially expressed genes in response to EB exposure, alongside other toxicants, highlighting the impact of EB on specific signaling pathways and gene regulation. The study utilized quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR) to validate these gene expression changes, indicating a direct relationship between EB exposure and alterations in gene expression profiles."
