    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) administered to rats to study its effects on global gene expression profiles in blood. The research aims to identify changes in RNA expression as a potential biomarker for toxicity, indicating a direct relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and alterations in gene expression. This suggests that ethylbenzene can influence molecular responses in biological systems, highlighting its relevance in toxicological studies."
