    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed primarily in relation to its neurotoxic and ototoxic effects following inhalation exposure. However, there is no direct mention or analysis of its impact on inspiration function or respiratory health. The focus is on the toxicological effects of ethylbenzene and other BTEX compounds, rather than their influence on respiratory physiology or function."
