    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed as part of the BTEXS group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are inhaled and absorbed during exposure. While the inhalation of these toxicants, including ethylbenzene, is linked to respiratory function, the specific relationship to inspiration function is not directly addressed. The focus is primarily on absorption rates rather than the impact on respiratory mechanics or inspiration function itself."
