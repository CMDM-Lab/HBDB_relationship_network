    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to exposure levels during physical exercise, which can influence blood concentrations of various hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene. However, the discussion does not provide a direct link to the inspiration function or respiratory effects, only noting potential irritation to the respiratory tract. The relationship remains vague and lacks specific details on how ethylbenzene directly affects inspiration function."
