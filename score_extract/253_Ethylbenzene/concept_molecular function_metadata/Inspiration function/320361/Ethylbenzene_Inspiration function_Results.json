    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to BTEX exposure levels during exercise, where cumulative inhaled mass was significantly higher during physical activity compared to rest. While ethylbenzene is part of the BTEX group, the specific impact of ethylbenzene on inspiration function is not directly discussed, leaving its relationship to respiratory function somewhat implied rather than explicitly defined."
