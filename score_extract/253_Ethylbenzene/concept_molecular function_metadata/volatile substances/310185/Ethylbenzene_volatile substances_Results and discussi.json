    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed as a less volatile compound compared to other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene and toluene. The study highlights the differences in response times of various volatile substances during a concentration pulse experiment, indicating that ethylbenzene has a slower permeation rate and delayed response in chromatographic analysis. This suggests that ethylbenzene is part of the broader category of volatile substances, but its behavior in the experiment is distinct due to its lower volatility."
