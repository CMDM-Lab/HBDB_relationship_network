    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is evaluated for its effects on cell growth, with a reported NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration) of 50 Î¼M, indicating that concentrations above this threshold lead to significant inhibition of cell proliferation. At 1 mM, ethylbenzene caused almost complete arrest of cell growth, highlighting its cytotoxic potential compared to other BTEX compounds. This suggests a direct and detrimental relationship between ethylbenzene exposure and cell growth inhibition."
