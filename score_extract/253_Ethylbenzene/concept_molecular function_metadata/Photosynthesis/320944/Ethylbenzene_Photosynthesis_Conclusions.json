    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is linked to photosynthesis through its impact on plant health and function. The study indicates that exposure to ethylbenzene affects chlorophyll fluorescence, which is a measure of photosynthetic efficiency. This suggests that the ability of plants to tolerate air pollution, including ethylbenzene, is crucial for maintaining their photosynthetic processes, highlighting the importance of cuticle composition in VOC uptake and plant health."
