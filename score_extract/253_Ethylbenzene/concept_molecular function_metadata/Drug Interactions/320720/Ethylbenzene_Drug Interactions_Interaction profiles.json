    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its potential interactions with other chemicals, particularly benzene and toluene, regarding their hematotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The text suggests that ethylbenzene may reduce the harmful effects of benzene through competitive metabolic interactions, indicating a significant relationship between ethylbenzene and drug interactions, particularly in the context of toxicological assessments. However, the available data on these interactions remain limited and indeterminate."
