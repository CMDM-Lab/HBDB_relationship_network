    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and alkanes are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). Ethylbenzene is categorized under alkylated benzenes, while alkanes include compounds like heptane and nonane. Both groups are prevalent in the emissions analyzed, indicating a shared origin from the decomposition processes occurring in MSW biostabilization, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between ethylbenzene and alkanes is discussed."
