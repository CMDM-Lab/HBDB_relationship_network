    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and alkanes are mentioned as components of a chemical analysis involving a sorbent packed needle trap device. Ethylbenzene is categorized alongside n-alkanes (n-octane, n-nonane, n-decane, and n-undecane) as part of the BTEX group, indicating they are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used in the same analytical framework. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their inclusion in the same study."
