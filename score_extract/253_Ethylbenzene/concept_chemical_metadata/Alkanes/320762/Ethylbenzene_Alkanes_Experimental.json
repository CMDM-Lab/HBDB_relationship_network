    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as an internal standard for the analysis of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) compounds, while alkanes are analyzed for their distribution in total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). Both ethylbenzene and alkanes are part of the broader category of hydrocarbons analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) techniques. However, the relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same analytical process rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship."
