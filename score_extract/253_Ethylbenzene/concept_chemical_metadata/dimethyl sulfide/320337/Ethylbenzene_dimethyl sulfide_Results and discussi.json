    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dimethyl sulfide are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the municipal solid waste (MSW) biostabilization process. They are part of a broader analysis of various chemical compounds released, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or functional relationships. Their mention is primarily as components of the VOCs identified in the study."
