    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the alkylated benzenes among the various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during municipal solid waste (MSW) biostabilization. Alkenes, such as 2-methyl-hexene and butenes, are also mentioned as part of the VOCs identified. While both terms are part of the broader category of organic compounds emitted during the same process, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship detailed between ethylbenzene and alkenes."
