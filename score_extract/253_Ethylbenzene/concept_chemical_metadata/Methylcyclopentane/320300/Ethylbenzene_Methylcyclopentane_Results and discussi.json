    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and methylcyclopentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in ambient atmospheric measurements during a monitoring effort. They are part of a larger group of fuel components observed in a specific sample that generated high VOC concentrations. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their co-occurrence in the sampling data."
