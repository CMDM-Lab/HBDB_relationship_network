    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed in relation to its adsorption behavior on diesel soot particles. The presence of soot significantly reduces the amount of ethylbenzene in the air, indicating a strong interaction between the compound and the soot surface. This interaction is characterized by a decrease in partition coefficient values, suggesting that soot enhances the adsorption of ethylbenzene compared to other surfaces. Thus, the relationship highlights the role of soot in affecting the environmental behavior of ethylbenzene."
