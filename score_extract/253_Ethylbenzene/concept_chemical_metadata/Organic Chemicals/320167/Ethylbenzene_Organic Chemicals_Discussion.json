    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that elicits specific transcriptomic responses in peripheral blood when exposed to environmental toxicants. The study highlights the role of organic chemicals, including EB, in inducing molecular changes that can serve as early detection markers for chemical exposure, emphasizing the significance of VOCs in toxicological research."
