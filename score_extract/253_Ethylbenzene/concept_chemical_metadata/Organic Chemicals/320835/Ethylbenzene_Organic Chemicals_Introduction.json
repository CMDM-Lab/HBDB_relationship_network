    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being studied in relation to their formation in an electric arc furnace environment. The investigation aims to understand the mechanisms behind the generation of various organic chemicals, including ethylbenzene, as part of a broader analysis of VOCs like benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTEX). This indicates that ethylbenzene is categorized within the larger group of organic chemicals being examined for their production under specific conditions."
