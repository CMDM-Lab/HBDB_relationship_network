    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene (EB) is mentioned as one of the organic compounds studied for its sorption behavior onto tire powder and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane. The discussion focuses on the interactions and mass transfer of various organic chemicals, including EB, indicating its classification as an organic chemical. However, the relationship is primarily about its behavior in a mixture rather than a specific interaction with the broader category of organic chemicals."
