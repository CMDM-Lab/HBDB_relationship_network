    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylene. These compounds are commonly found in petroleum products and are significant organic chemicals contributing to urban air pollution. The study highlights the increase in blood levels of ethylbenzene during high-intensity exercise, indicating its relevance as an organic chemical in environmental health discussions, particularly concerning exposure risks for individuals exercising in polluted areas."
