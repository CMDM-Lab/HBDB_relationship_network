    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and indan are both mentioned as components of coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), including ethylbenzene and indan, which are relevant in environmental assessments of contaminated sites. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between these two compounds beyond their shared presence in coal tar."
