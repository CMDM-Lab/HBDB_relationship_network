    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a representative of monoaromatic hydrocarbons, which are a subset of hydrocarbons. The study focuses on the biofiltration of ethylbenzene vapors, highlighting its moderate biodegradability and the performance of different biofilter media in removing this hydrocarbon from polluted air. The relationship is significant as ethylbenzene is a specific example within the broader category of hydrocarbons."
