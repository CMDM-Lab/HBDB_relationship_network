    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a monoaromatic hydrocarbon compound, part of the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes). The discussion highlights the environmental and health risks associated with these hydrocarbons, particularly their toxicity and classification as carcinogens. Ethylbenzene's inclusion in the broader category of hydrocarbons emphasizes its significance in studies related to water contamination and industrial pollution."
