    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as a monoaromatic hydrocarbon that can be detected using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The text discusses the challenges in separating ethylbenzene from other similar hydrocarbons, such as xylene isomers, due to their similar retention times. This indicates that ethylbenzene is a specific type of hydrocarbon, highlighting its classification within the broader category of hydrocarbons."
