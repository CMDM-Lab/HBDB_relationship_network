    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as an internal standard for the analysis of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and other alkylbenzenes. Hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene, are analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) techniques to determine their distribution and concentration in environmental samples. This indicates that ethylbenzene is a specific type of hydrocarbon being studied, highlighting its relevance in the broader category of hydrocarbons."
