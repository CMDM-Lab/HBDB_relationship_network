    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the components of the BTEX mixture, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylene, all of which are classified as hydrocarbons. The study aims to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of these hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene, on plant cells. The relationship is established through the inclusion of ethylbenzene in the broader category of hydrocarbons being tested for environmental toxicity."
