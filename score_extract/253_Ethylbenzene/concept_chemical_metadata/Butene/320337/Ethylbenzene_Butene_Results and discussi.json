    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and butene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) biostabilization. Ethylbenzene is categorized under alkylated benzenes, while butene is classified as an alkene. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between these two compounds beyond their classification as VOCs emitted during the same process."
