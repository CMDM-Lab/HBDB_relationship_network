    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and cyclohexane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). Ethylbenzene is categorized as an alkylated benzene, while cyclohexane is classified as an alkane. They are part of a broader analysis of VOCs, but no specific interaction or relationship between the two compounds is discussed beyond their classification and presence in the same study."
