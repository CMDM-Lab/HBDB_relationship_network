    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are components of BTEX mixtures, which are analyzed for their combined toxic effects in mammalian cells. The study discusses the concentration additive effects of these compounds, indicating that while they are part of the same chemical family and contribute to toxicity, their specific interactions or individual effects are not deeply explored. The focus is on the overall mixture rather than a direct relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene."
