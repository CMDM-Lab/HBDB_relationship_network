    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both components of the BTEX group, which refers to a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The study examines their effects on chlorophyll content in E. gracilis, indicating that both compounds contribute to chlorophyll inhibition in a dose-dependent manner. The order of response shows that 4-xylene has a greater effect on chlorophyll inhibition than ethylbenzene, suggesting a comparative analysis of their toxicity within the same experimental framework."
