    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both components of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) mixture used in experiments to study toxic responses. They are mixed in specific ratios to reflect their common presence in petrol, indicating their relevance in assessing combined toxic effects. However, the context does not detail any specific interactions or comparative analysis between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their inclusion in the BTEX mixtures."
