    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in soil vapor samples and indoor air assessments. They are part of a broader analysis of chemical exposure in buildings, but there is no specific discussion of their interaction or relationship beyond their presence in the same environmental study. Thus, their connection is limited to being part of a list of frequently detected chemicals."
