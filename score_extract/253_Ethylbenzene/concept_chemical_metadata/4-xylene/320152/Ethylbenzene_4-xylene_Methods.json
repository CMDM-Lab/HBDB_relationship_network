    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a health risk assessment involving inhalation exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They are included in the calculation of Hazard Quotients (HQs) and Hazard Indices (HIs) to evaluate potential non-carcinogenic effects from simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the same risk assessment framework."
