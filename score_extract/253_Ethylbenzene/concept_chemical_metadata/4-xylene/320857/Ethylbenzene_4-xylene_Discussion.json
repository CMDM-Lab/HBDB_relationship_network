    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with exposure from activities such as pumping gasoline and using paint thinners. The study indicates that these compounds can be elevated in individuals exposed to specific environmental factors, but it does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their common association with VOC exposure."
