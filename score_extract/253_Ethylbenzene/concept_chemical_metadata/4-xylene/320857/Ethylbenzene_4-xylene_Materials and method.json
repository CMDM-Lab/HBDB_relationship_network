    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as part of a study analyzing the variability in detection rates of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in blood samples from U.S. adults. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not explicitly discussed, and they are primarily included in a list of VOCs being studied for trends and demographic factors affecting their levels. There is no direct interaction or functional relationship highlighted between the two compounds."
