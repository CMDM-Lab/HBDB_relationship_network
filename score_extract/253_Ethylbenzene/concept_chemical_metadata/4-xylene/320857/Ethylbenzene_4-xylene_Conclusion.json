    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose levels have decreased over the study period from 2005 to 2012. The study compares the levels of these VOCs in smokers and nonsmokers, indicating that both groups experienced similar declines in ethylbenzene and 4-xylene levels. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not explored in detail, as the focus is on their trends in relation to smoking status rather than their direct interaction or significance."
