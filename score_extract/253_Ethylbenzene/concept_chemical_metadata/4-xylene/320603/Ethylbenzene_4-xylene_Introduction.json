    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are discussed in relation to their ratios (X/E) as indicators of atmospheric photochemical reactivity and air mass age. The X/E ratio helps differentiate between pollution sources and assess the reactivity of air samples, with xylenes being more reactive than ethylbenzene. This relationship highlights the importance of these compounds in environmental monitoring and air quality assessment."
