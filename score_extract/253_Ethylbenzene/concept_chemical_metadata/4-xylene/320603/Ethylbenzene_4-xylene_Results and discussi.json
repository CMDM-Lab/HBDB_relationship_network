    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are analyzed as part of the xylene/ethylbenzene (X/E) ratio used to assess the relative age of air parcels in industrial park neighborhoods. The study indicates that the X/E ratio varies significantly across different locations, suggesting that both compounds are influenced by similar industrial emissions and environmental factors. However, the specific interaction or functional relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the X/E ratio analysis."
