    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their method detection limits (MDLs) in a study involving calibration curves. They are part of a group of VOCs assessed for accuracy in analytical methods, but no specific interaction or relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is discussed beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework."
