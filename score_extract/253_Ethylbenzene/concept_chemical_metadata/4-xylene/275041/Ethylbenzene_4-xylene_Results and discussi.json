    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and p-xylene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) included in a batch experiment assessing their removal from liquid phases in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process. The study reports high removal efficiencies for both compounds, indicating their similar behavior in the treatment process. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and p-xylene are not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the same experimental setup."
