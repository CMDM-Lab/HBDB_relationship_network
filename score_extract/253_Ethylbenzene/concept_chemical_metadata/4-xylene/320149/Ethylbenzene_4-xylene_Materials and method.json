    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both part of a group of aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) being studied for their partition processes between air, aqueous solutions, and solid materials. They are included in a standard solution prepared for laboratory experiments, indicating they are analyzed together, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions or unique relationships beyond their classification as components of the same group of compounds."
