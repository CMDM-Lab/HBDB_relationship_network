    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) group, which are volatile organic compounds. The study discusses their interactions with silica surfaces and the impact of urban aerosol particles on their presence in the air. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene is not explicitly detailed beyond their classification as BTEX compounds, indicating a shared category but lacking direct interaction or comparative analysis."
