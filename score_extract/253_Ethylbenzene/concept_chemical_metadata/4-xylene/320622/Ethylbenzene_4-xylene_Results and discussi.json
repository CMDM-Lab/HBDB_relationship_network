    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) group, which are volatile organic compounds monitored in water samples. The study discusses the detection limits and quantification of these compounds in contaminated water, indicating their relevance in environmental monitoring. However, there is no specific interaction or relationship detailed between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their classification as part of the BTEX group."
