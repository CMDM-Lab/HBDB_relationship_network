    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as aromatic compounds whose concentrations at saturation in water are influenced by their hydrophobic characteristics. The results indicate that the concentration at saturation for ethylbenzene and 4-xylene increases significantly when compared to other compounds, suggesting a shared behavior in terms of solubility and transfer characteristics in aqueous environments. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or a direct relationship between the two compounds beyond their classification as aromatic compounds."
