    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose concentrations were monitored during a study on air quality. The data indicates that while their peak concentrations occurred at different times, they are part of a broader analysis of VOC dispersion influenced by meteorological factors. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their co-occurrence in the study."
