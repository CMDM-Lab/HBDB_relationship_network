    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (m,p-xylene and o-xylene). These compounds are primarily emitted from traffic sources in urban areas of Hong Kong, contributing significantly to the total volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparative analysis between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their classification as VOCs from similar emission sources."
