    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with vehicle emissions, specifically in the study of exposure levels during public transportation commutes in Guangzhou. They are part of a group of aromatic VOCs measured to assess commuter exposure, indicating their relevance as markers of vehicular pollution. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their shared categorization as VOCs."
