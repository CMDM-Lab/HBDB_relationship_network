    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), which are volatile organic compounds commonly found in the environment and known to increase in blood levels during physical activity. The study highlights the presence of these compounds in the blood of individuals, particularly after exercise, but does not delve into a specific interaction or relationship between ethylbenzene and 4-xylene beyond their classification as BTEX components."
