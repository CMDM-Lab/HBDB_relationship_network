    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both identified as components of the BTEX group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the environment. The study reports significant increases in blood levels of ethylbenzene and m/p-xylene during high-intensity exercise, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the context of exposure to air pollution during physical activity. However, their specific interaction or comparative significance is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as VOCs."
