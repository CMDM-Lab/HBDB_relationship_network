    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in blood samples from an exercising subject. The study provides statistical significance for ethylbenzene (p=0.0003) and includes 4-xylene in the broader analysis of VOCs, but does not detail any specific interaction or functional relationship between the two compounds beyond their presence in the same analytical context."
