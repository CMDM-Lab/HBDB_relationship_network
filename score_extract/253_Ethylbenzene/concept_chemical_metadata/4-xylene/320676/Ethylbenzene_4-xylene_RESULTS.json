    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the homes of asthmatic children. They are part of a broader analysis of VOC exposure, but there is no specific discussion of their individual effects or interactions related to asthma or health outcomes. Their mention is primarily as components of a larger group of VOCs detected in the study."
