    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose emission rates were estimated from various products. However, the relationship between them is not explicitly discussed, and they are simply listed among other VOCs without any direct interaction or comparative analysis provided. Their mention is part of a broader study on VOC emissions rather than a focused examination of their relationship."
