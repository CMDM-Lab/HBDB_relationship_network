    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and hopane are both mentioned as components involved in the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons. Ethylbenzene is used as an internal standard for BTEX and alkylbenzene analysis, while hopane serves as a biomarker for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs). However, their specific interactions or functional relationships are not discussed, indicating they are part of a broader analytical framework rather than having a direct connection."
