    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 2-methyl-1-hexene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). They are part of a broader analysis of various chemical compounds released during this process, categorized under alkylated benzenes and alkenes, respectively. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and 2-methyl-1-hexene beyond their classification as VOCs in the same study."
