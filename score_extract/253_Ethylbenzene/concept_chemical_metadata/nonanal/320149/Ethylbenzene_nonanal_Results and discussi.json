    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and nonanal are discussed in relation to their adsorption behavior on different surfaces, particularly in the presence of diesel soot. Ethylbenzene is noted to have a significant decrease in its presence in the air due to adsorption, while nonanal is mentioned as part of the broader category of long-chain aldehydes. However, the specific interaction or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and nonanal is not elaborated upon, indicating a more general relationship based on their adsorption characteristics rather than a direct interaction."
