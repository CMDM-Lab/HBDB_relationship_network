    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and heptanes are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). Ethylbenzene is categorized under alkylated benzenes, while heptanes fall under alkanes. They are part of a broader analysis of VOCs, but no specific interaction or relationship between them is discussed beyond their classification as components of the emitted gases."
