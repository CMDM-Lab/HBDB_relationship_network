    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is used as a substrate in a biofilter system made of methacrylate. The biofilter is designed to facilitate the biodegradation of ethylbenzene, indicating that methacrylate serves as a structural material for the biofilter rather than having a direct chemical interaction with ethylbenzene. The relationship is primarily functional, as methacrylate provides the medium for the biodegradation process to occur."
