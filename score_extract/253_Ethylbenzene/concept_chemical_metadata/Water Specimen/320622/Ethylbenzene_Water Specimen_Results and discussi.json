    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is analyzed as part of a study on the detection of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, o-xylene) in water specimens. The method described demonstrates the capability to monitor trace levels of ethylbenzene in water samples, indicating its relevance in assessing water quality and contamination levels. The study highlights the importance of detecting ethylbenzene in water to ensure it meets safety standards for drinking water."
