    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and butadiene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in the indoor air of plastic production and recycling facilities. However, the text does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between ethylbenzene and butadiene, merely listing them among other VOCs generated from plastic waste. Their presence is noted in the context of environmental emissions, but no specific connection or comparative analysis is made."
