    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and n-dodecane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. They are part of a broader discussion on the environmental hazards associated with contaminated sites, particularly concerning soil vapor and groundwater contamination. However, there is no specific interaction or functional relationship detailed between ethylbenzene and n-dodecane beyond their classification as VOCs present in coal tar."
