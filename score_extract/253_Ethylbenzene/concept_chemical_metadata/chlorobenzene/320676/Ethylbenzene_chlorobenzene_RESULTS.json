    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the homes of asthmatic children. They are part of a broader list of VOCs detected, but there is no specific discussion of their interactions, health effects, or comparative significance in relation to asthma or allergic problems. Their mention is purely coincidental within the context of VOC exposure."
