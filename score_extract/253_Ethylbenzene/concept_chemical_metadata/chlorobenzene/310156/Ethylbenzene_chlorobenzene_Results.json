    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and chlorobenzene are both discussed in relation to their cytotoxic effects on cell proliferation. Ethylbenzene has a NOEC of 50 Î¼M, indicating significant toxicity, while chlorobenzenes, particularly those with multiple chlorine substitutions, exhibit even higher toxicity levels. The comparison highlights the varying degrees of cytotoxicity among these compounds, suggesting that chlorobenzenes are generally more toxic than ethylbenzene."
