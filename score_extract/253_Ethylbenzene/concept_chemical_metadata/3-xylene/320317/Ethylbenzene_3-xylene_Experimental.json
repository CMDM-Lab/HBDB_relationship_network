    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) included in the analysis of soil samples using advanced gas chromatography techniques. They are part of the BTEX group, which is commonly studied for environmental monitoring. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene beyond their inclusion in the same analytical methodology."
