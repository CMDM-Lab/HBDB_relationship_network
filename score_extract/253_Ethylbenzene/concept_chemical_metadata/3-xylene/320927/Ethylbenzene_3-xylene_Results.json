    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both components of the BTEX group, which were studied for their effects on chlorophyll content in E. gracilis. The research indicates that chlorophyll a is more sensitive to BTEX compounds, with ethylbenzene showing a specific order of response in terms of chlorophyll inhibition. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene is not explicitly detailed beyond their inclusion in the BTEX analysis."
