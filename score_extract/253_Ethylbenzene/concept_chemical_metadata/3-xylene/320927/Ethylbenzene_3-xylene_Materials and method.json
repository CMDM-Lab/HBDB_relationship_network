    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both components of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) mixture used in experiments to study toxic responses. They are mixed in specific ratios to reflect their common presence in petrol, indicating their relevance in assessing combined toxic effects. However, the context does not detail their individual interactions or specific roles beyond being part of the same mixture."
