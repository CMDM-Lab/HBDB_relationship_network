    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are components of BTEX mixtures, which are analyzed for their combined toxic effects in mammalian cells. The study discusses the concentration additive effects of these compounds, indicating that their interactions may influence toxicity levels. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene is not deeply explored beyond their inclusion in the BTEX mixtures, suggesting a shared category rather than a direct interaction."
