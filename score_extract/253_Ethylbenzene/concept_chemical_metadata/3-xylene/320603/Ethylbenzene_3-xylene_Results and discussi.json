    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are analyzed for their atmospheric lifetimes. The discussion focuses on the relative stability and reactivity of these compounds in the environment, with ethylbenzene having a shorter estimated lifetime compared to 3-xylene. However, the relationship between them is primarily based on their classification as VOCs rather than any direct interaction or specific functional relationship."
