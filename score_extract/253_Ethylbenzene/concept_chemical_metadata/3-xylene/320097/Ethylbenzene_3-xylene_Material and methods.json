    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both components of the BTEX mixture, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The study evaluates the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of these compounds and their biodegraded products. While both are part of the same chemical group and are tested together, the specific interactions or comparative effects between ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship."
