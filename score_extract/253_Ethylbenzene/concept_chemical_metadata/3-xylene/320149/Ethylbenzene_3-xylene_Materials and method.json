    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 3-xylene are both part of a group of aromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX) analyzed in laboratory experiments concerning their partition processes between air, aqueous solutions, and solid materials. They are included in a standard solution prepared for the study, indicating they are relevant to the same chemical analysis but without a specific interaction or relationship detailed between them."
