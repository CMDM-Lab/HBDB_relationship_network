    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and naphthalene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. They are mentioned alongside other VOCs and semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) that pose potential hazards in contaminated sites. However, there is no specific discussion of their interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as components of coal tar."
