    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and naphthalene are both mentioned as compounds involved in biodegradation studies by a bacterial consortium. The text discusses kinetic parameters and growth yields associated with the degradation of these compounds, indicating that both are relevant to the study of microbial degradation processes. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not elaborated upon, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed relationship."
