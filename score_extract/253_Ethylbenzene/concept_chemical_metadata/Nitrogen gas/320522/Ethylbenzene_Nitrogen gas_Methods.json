    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and nitrogen gas are related through the calibration of a gas chromatograph used to measure ethylbenzene concentrations in the air stream. Nitrogen gas serves as a component of the synthetic standard mixture for calibration, ensuring accurate measurement of ethylbenzene levels. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship between ethylbenzene and nitrogen gas beyond this calibration purpose."
