    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and trihalomethanes (THMs) are both identified as common soil pollutants, with ethylbenzene being part of the BTEX group alongside benzene and toluene. The text discusses their potential carcinogenicity and sources of contamination, particularly emphasizing that THMs can form as byproducts of chlorination processes. While both are pollutants, the relationship is primarily categorical rather than direct, as they are mentioned in the same context of environmental contamination without specific interactions detailed."
