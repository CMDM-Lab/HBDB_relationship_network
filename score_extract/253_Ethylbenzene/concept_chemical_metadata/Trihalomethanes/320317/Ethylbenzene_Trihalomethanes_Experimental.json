    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and trihalomethanes (THMs) are both mentioned as analytes in a proposed methodology for determining volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil samples. The methodology utilizes headspace autosampling and gas chromatography to achieve high sensitivity in detecting these compounds. However, there is no direct discussion of their chemical interactions or specific relevance to each other beyond their inclusion in the same analytical framework."
