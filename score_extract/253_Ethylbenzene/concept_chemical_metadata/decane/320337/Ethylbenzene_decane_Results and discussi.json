    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and decane are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). Ethylbenzene is categorized among alkylated benzenes, while decane is classified as an alkane. They are part of a broader analysis of VOCs, but no direct interaction or specific relationship between them is discussed beyond their classification as components of the emitted gases."
