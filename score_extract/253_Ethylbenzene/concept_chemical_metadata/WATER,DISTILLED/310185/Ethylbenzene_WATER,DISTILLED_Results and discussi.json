    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and distilled water are related through their roles in a chromatographic analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights how the presence of distilled water affects the peak areas of ethylbenzene and other VOCs during the experiment. Ethylbenzene's response time to changes in concentration is slower compared to more volatile compounds like benzene, indicating a significant interaction between the two in the context of sample analysis and the effects of water flow rates on compound detection."
