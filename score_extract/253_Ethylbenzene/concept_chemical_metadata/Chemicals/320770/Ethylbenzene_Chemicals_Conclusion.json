    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is categorized as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) alongside toluene and benzene, which are primarily derived from vehicle exhausts. The mention of ethylbenzene within the broader category of chemicals highlights its role as a chemical pollutant in urban environments, particularly in relation to industrial emissions and vehicular sources. However, the context does not delve into specific interactions or implications of ethylbenzene as a chemical beyond its classification as a VOC."
