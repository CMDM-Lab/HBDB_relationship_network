    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as part of a group of chemicals known as BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene) that were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The reference to ethylbenzene is incidental, as it is listed among other chemicals without any specific discussion of its properties, functions, or interactions within the context of the study. Thus, the relationship is primarily categorical, identifying ethylbenzene as one of the chemicals used in the research."
