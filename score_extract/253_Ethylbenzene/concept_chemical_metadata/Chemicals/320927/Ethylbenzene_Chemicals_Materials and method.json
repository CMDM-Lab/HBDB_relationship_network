    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is one of the specific chemicals included in a mixture of BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, p-xylene) used for experimental evaluation of their effects on E. gracilis. The mention of ethylbenzene as part of a group of chemicals indicates its relevance in the study, but does not elaborate on its individual properties or interactions beyond being a component of the BTEX mixture."
