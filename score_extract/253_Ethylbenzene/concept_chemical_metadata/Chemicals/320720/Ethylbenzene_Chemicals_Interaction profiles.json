    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is discussed as part of a group of chemicals (BTEX) that includes benzene, toluene, and xylene. The text evaluates the potential neurotoxic and carcinogenic interactions among these chemicals, indicating that ethylbenzene may influence the toxicity of benzene through competitive metabolic interactions. However, the specific effects of ethylbenzene on its own or in combination with other chemicals remain largely indeterminate, highlighting its role within a broader chemical context rather than as an isolated entity."
