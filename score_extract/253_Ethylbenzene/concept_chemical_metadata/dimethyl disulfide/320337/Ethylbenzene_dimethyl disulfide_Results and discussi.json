    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dimethyl disulfide are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during the biostabilization of municipal solid waste (MSW). They are part of a broader analysis of various chemical compounds released during this process, but no specific interaction or functional relationship between ethylbenzene and dimethyl disulfide is discussed. Their mention is primarily in the context of their presence in the gas emissions rather than any direct connection."
