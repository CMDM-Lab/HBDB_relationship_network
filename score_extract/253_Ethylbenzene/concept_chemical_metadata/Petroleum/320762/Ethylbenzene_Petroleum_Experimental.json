    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is analyzed as part of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and is specifically mentioned as an internal standard for BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) analysis. This indicates that ethylbenzene is a component of petroleum products and is relevant in the study of petroleum hydrocarbon distribution and contamination analysis. The relationship is significant as ethylbenzene is a common constituent of petroleum and is used to assess the presence and concentration of petroleum-derived compounds in environmental samples."
