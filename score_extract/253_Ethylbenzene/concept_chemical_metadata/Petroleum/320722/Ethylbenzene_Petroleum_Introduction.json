    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) that serve as indicators for human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and petroleum-related substances. The text highlights that BTEXs are primarily released into the environment from traffic sources, particularly gasoline and diesel, linking ethylbenzene directly to petroleum products and their impact on air quality. This establishes a clear relationship between ethylbenzene and petroleum as both are associated with VOC emissions from fuel sources."
