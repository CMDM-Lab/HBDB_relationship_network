    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are commonly found in crude petroleum and its products, such as petrol. The study highlights the increase in blood levels of ethylbenzene during high-intensity exercise in areas with BTEX pollution, indicating a direct link between ethylbenzene exposure and petroleum sources. This relationship underscores the health implications for individuals exercising near roadways where petroleum-derived VOCs are prevalent."
