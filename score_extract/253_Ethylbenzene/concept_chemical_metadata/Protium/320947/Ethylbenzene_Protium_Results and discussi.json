    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as part of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) compounds analyzed for their concentration in biogas emissions. Protium, a stable isotope of hydrogen, is not directly related to ethylbenzene or its emissions. The context does not provide any interaction or relevance between ethylbenzene and protium, indicating they are mentioned in separate contexts without a clear connection."
