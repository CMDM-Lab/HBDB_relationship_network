    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and 4-chlorotoluene are both identified as aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) commonly found in municipal wastewater treatment scenarios. The study highlights their presence among other VOCs, indicating that they are part of the same category of compounds being analyzed for their occurrence and treatment in activated-sludge plants and membrane bioreactors. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the biodegradation process."
