    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned in relation to its removal efficiency from plant cuticles, which were transferred onto aluminum plates for experimentation. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and aluminum is not directly discussed beyond the use of aluminum as a substrate for the cuticle analysis. There is no indication of a chemical or biological interaction between the two terms."
