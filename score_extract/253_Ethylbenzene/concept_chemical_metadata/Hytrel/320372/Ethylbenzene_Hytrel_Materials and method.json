    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) compounds being evaluated for their diffusivity and bioavailability in various polymers, including Hytrel. However, there is no direct discussion of how ethylbenzene interacts with or affects Hytrel specifically, as the focus is on polymer selection for BTEX uptake and release."
