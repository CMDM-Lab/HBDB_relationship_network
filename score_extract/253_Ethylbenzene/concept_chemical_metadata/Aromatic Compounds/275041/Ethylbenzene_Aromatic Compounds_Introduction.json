    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is categorized as a monoaromatic compound, which is a type of aromatic compound. The discussion focuses on the biodegradation of mono- and poly-aromatic compounds in activated sludge processes, highlighting the need for microbial acclimatization to effectively degrade these specific substrates. Ethylbenzene's role as a substrate for microbial degradation underscores its classification within the broader category of aromatic compounds, emphasizing the importance of understanding both biotic and non-biotic processes in wastewater treatment."
