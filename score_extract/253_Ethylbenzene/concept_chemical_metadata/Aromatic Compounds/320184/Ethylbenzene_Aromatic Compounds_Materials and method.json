    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as one of the target aromatic compounds analyzed within a broader group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) known as BTEXS, which includes benzene, toluene, and xylenes. The study employs gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to assess these aromatic compounds in wastewater treatment processes, highlighting ethylbenzene's classification as an aromatic compound and its relevance in environmental monitoring and pollution assessment."
