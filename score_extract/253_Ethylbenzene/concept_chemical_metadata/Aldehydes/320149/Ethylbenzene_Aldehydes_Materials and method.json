    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and aldehydes are both part of a study examining the partition processes of aromatic hydrocarbons and C6â€“C10 n-aldehydes in various environmental matrices. They are included in separate stock standard solutions for laboratory experiments, indicating they are both relevant to the analysis of organic compounds in environmental samples. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and aldehydes beyond their inclusion in the same experimental framework."
