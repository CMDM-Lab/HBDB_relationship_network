    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) being treated in a compost-based biofilter. The study highlights that toluene and benzene were removed more efficiently than ethylbenzene and o-xylene, indicating a difference in their biodegradation rates within the biofilter system. This suggests that while both compounds are related as VOCs, their removal dynamics in the biofilter differ significantly."
