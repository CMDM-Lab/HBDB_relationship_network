    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as pollutants being investigated for their removal efficiency by various plant species. The study aims to understand how different physiological factors of the plants, such as stomatal and cuticular properties, influence the uptake of these two volatile organic compounds. While both compounds are studied together, the specific interactions or comparative removal efficiencies between them are not detailed."
