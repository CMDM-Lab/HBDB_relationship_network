    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were absorbed by plant cuticles, specifically in relation to their wax composition. The study indicates that while toluene did not significantly affect the potential quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) in treated plants, ethylbenzene exposure resulted in significant differences in the same measure. This suggests that while both compounds are relevant in the context of plant interactions, their effects on plant physiology differ notably."
