    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both examined for their removal efficiency from plant cuticles. The study investigates how cuticular wax from different plants interacts with these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during fumigation. The relationship is centered on their comparative analysis in terms of removal efficiency, indicating a direct connection in the context of plant physiology and VOC absorption."
