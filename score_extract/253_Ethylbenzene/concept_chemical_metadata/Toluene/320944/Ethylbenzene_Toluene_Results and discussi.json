    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are compared regarding their toxicity to plants. The results indicate that ethylbenzene is more toxic than toluene, as evidenced by significant differences in the Fv/Fm ratio between control and treated plants exposed to ethylbenzene. This suggests that while both are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their effects on plant health differ, with ethylbenzene exhibiting greater detrimental impacts on photosynthetic function."
