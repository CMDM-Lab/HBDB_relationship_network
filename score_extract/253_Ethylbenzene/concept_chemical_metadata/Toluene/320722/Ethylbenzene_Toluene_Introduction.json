    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. These compounds are recognized as indicators of human exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and petroleum-related substances. The context highlights their relevance in environmental monitoring, particularly concerning air quality and pollution from traffic and other human activities. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their classification as BTEX compounds."
