    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylenes) exposure, particularly in relation to indoor air quality and sources of exposure. The study highlights that air conditioner use is associated with increased exposure to both compounds, suggesting a shared indoor source of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their inclusion in the BTEX group."
