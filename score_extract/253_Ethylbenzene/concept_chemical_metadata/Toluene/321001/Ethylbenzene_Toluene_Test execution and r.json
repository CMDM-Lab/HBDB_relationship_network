    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) compounds analyzed in groundwater testing. The results indicate that both compounds experienced reductions in concentration during the testing process, suggesting they are part of the same group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being monitored for contamination levels. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their inclusion in the BTEX group."
