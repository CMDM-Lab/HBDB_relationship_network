    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are measured in the airborne concentrations of workers involved in tanker loading activities. The study highlights that these workers are exposed to significantly higher levels of both ethylbenzene and toluene compared to other occupations, indicating a shared exposure risk. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly discussed beyond their co-occurrence in the occupational exposure scenario."
