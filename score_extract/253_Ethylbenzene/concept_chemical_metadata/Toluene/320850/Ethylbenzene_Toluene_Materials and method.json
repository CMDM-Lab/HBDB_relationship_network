    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and are evaluated for their associations with personal airborne exposure and urinary markers. The study employs statistical methods to assess the relationship between airborne levels of these compounds and their corresponding urinary concentrations, indicating a shared relevance in occupational exposure assessments. However, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed beyond their inclusion in the BTEX group."
