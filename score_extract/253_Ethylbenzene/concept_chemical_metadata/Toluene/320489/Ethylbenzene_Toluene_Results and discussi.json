    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both discussed as aromatic compounds whose concentrations at saturation in water are influenced by their hydrophobic characteristics. The results indicate that the concentration of toluene, along with ethylbenzene, significantly increases when compared to other compounds, suggesting a similar behavior in terms of solubility and transfer characteristics in aqueous environments. However, the relationship is primarily based on their physical properties rather than a direct chemical interaction."
