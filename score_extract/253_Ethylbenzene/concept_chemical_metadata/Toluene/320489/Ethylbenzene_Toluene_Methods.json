    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both included as components of a volatile organic compound (VOC) mixture used in a semi-industrial bioscrubber unit. They are categorized together as aromatic compounds, indicating they share similar chemical properties and potential applications in VOC treatment processes. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or functional relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same mixture."
