    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of a methodology for determining trihalomethanes (THMs) and BTEX in soil samples. They are listed among other solvents used in the analytical process, indicating they are relevant to the study but without any specific interaction or comparative analysis between them. Their relationship is primarily as components of the same analytical framework rather than a direct chemical or functional connection."
