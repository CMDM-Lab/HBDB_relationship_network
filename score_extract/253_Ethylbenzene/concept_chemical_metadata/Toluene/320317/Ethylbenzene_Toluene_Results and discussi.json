    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are analyzed as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during an experiment assessing the effects of injector temperature on their analytical signals. Both compounds exhibited increased peak areas at higher temperatures, indicating a similar behavior in terms of volatility and response to temperature changes. However, the specific interaction or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated upon beyond their shared analytical conditions."
