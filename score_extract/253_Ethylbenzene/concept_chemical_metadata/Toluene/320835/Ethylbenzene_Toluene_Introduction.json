    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are formed during the melting process in an electric arc furnace. The study aims to investigate the mechanisms of VOC formation, specifically focusing on BTEX compounds, which include both ethylbenzene and toluene. However, the relationship between the two compounds is not elaborated upon beyond their classification as VOCs produced in similar conditions."
