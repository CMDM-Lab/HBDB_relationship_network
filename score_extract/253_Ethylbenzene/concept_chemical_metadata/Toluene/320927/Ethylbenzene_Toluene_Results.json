    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of the BTEX group, which refers to a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. The study examines their effects on chlorophyll content in E. gracilis, indicating that both compounds inhibit chlorophyll a and b, with ethylbenzene showing a stronger effect than toluene. The dose-response relationship highlights their toxicological significance in a mixed exposure scenario, suggesting a competitive or additive effect on chlorophyll inhibition."
