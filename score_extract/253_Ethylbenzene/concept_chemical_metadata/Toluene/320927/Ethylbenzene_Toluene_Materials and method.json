    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of BTEX mixtures, which are commonly found in petrol. The study involves creating two mixtures, BTEX-1 and BTEX-2, to investigate the toxic responses of these compounds along with others. While both are included in the mixtures, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or comparative effects, focusing instead on their collective toxicological assessment."
