    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX group, which are known for their neurotoxic effects upon inhalation. The text highlights the neurotoxicity of ethylbenzene and the brain damage associated with toluene exposure, indicating that both compounds share similar toxicological profiles and are studied for their effects on both mammals and aquatic microorganisms. However, the relationship is primarily based on their classification as toxic substances rather than a direct interaction or comparison between the two."
