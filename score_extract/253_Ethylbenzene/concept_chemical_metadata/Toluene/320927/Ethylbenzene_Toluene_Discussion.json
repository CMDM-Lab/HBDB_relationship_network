    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are components of BTEX mixtures, which are analyzed for their combined toxic effects in mammalian cells. The study indicates that the effects of these compounds are influenced by their concentrations and metabolic interactions via cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1. While both compounds are part of the same mixture and contribute to toxicity, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not deeply explored beyond their inclusion in the BTEX mixtures."
