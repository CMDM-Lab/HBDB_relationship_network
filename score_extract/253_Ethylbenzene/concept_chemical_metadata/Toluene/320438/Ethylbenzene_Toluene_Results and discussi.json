The ranking indicates that toluene has a higher toxicity tolerance (0.880) compared to ethylbenzene (0.730), suggesting that toluene is considered more toxic in this specific assessment. However, the relationship is primarily based on their comparative toxicity rather than a direct interaction or shared biological function."
