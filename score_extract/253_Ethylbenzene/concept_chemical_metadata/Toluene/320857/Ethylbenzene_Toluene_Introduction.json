    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with reported levels in adults. The data indicates that smokers have significantly higher levels of these VOCs compared to nonsmokers, suggesting a potential relationship in exposure patterns. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or comparative analysis between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs and their association with smoking status."
