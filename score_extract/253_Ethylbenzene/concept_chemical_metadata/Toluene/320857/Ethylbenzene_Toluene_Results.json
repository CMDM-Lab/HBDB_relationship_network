    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in relation to exposure from various sources. However, the text indicates that breathing fumes from these sources was not associated with increased levels of ethylbenzene or toluene, suggesting a lack of direct interaction or significant relationship between the two compounds in the studied scenarios. They are part of a broader discussion on VOCs but are not directly linked to each other."
