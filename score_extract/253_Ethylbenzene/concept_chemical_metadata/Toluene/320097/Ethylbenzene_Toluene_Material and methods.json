    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) that were subjected to a biodegradation process by bacteria. The concentrations of both compounds were measured before and after biodegradation, indicating their presence in the same environmental study. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed, as they are treated as part of a mixture rather than being directly related to each other."
