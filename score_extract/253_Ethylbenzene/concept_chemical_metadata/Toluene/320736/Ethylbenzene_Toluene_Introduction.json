    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are commonly associated with vehicle emissions. The study aims to measure and compare the exposure levels of these compounds, along with others, in various public transportation modes. While they are mentioned together as part of the same group of vehicle emission markers, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their shared association with urban commuting and air quality concerns."
