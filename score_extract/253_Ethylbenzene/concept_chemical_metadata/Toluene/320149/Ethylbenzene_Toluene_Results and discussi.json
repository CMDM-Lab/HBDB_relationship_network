    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as components of the BTEX group, which refers to a class of volatile organic compounds. The study discusses their interactions with silica surfaces and their relative amounts in the air, indicating that both compounds are analyzed for their environmental behavior. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not deeply explored beyond their classification as BTEX compounds and their comparative decrease in air concentration."
