    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with specific health-protecting limits set by the Hong Kong Indoor Air Quality Ordinance (HKIAQO). The study indicates that the measured concentrations of both compounds in public transport are below these limits, suggesting a regulatory focus on their potential health impacts. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative health effects beyond their inclusion in the same regulatory framework."
