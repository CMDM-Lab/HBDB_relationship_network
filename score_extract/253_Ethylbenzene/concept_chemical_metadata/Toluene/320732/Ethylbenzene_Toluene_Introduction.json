    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are monitored for exposure levels in various public transportation microenvironments in Hong Kong. They are part of a group of compounds (BTEX) associated with vehicular emissions, indicating a shared relevance in studies of air quality and pollution exposure.
