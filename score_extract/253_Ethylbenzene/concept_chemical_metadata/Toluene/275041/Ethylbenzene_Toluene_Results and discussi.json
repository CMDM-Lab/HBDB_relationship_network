    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) included in a batch experiment assessing their removal from liquid phases in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process. The study reports high removal efficiencies for both compounds, indicating they are treated similarly in the experimental setup. However, the specific interactions or differences in their biodegradation kinetics are not discussed, suggesting a general relationship based on their shared classification as VOCs rather than a detailed functional connection."
