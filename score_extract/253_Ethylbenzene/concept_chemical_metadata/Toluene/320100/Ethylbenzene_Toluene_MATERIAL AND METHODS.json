    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), which are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the air quality assessment in Viseu. They are mentioned together as part of a broader analysis of air pollutants, but no specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed beyond their classification as VOCs."
