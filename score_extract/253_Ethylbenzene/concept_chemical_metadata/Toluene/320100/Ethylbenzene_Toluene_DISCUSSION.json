    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with lung function deterioration and airway inflammation. The study highlights toluene's role as a known cause of occupational asthma, while ethylbenzene is suggested as a significant risk factor for asthma. Both compounds are implicated in respiratory health issues, indicating a shared relevance in the context of airway inflammation and asthma risk."
