    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to air pollution and are associated with respiratory health impacts in children. The study indicates that increased exposure to these compounds correlates with decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV1), suggesting a detrimental effect on lung function. Their relationship is highlighted through their shared role as pollutants affecting respiratory outcomes."
