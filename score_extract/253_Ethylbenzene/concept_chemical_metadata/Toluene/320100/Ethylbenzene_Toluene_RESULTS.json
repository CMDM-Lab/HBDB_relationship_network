    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with adverse effects on lung function. The study highlights a significant correlation between increasing exposure to these compounds and deterioration in respiratory metrics, such as FEV1. Both compounds are implicated in similar airway changes, indicating a shared impact on respiratory health."
