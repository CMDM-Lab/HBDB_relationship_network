    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as aromatic compounds associated with vehicle emissions. The study notes significant differences in their concentrations in diesel-fueled cars, although these discrepancies may be attributed to experimental errors. Both compounds serve as markers for vehicle emissions, but their specific relationship or interaction is not elaborated upon beyond their shared classification as aromatic compounds."
