    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as significant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from photocopiers, contributing to the overall BTEXS (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylenes) levels in the breathing zones of photocopier workers. The study highlights their presence as part of the VOC emissions profile, indicating a shared relevance in occupational exposure scenarios, but does not delve into their specific interactions or comparative effects."
