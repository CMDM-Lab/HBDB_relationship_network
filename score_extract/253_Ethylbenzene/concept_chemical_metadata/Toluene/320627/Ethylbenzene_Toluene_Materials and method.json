    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the BTEXS group, which also includes benzene, xylenes, and styrene. The discussion focuses on their inhalation exposure and absorption rates in humans, indicating that both compounds are subject to similar absorption dynamics when inhaled. However, the context does not delve into specific interactions or comparative effects between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs and their shared exposure risks."
