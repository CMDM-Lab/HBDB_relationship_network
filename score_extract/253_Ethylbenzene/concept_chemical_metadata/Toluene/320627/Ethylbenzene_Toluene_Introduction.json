    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) known as BTEXS, which are studied for their health effects and regulatory guidelines. While they are listed together and share similar concerns regarding exposure limits and potential health risks, the context does not provide specific details about their direct interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as VOCs. Thus, their relationship is more about their shared categorization rather than a direct functional or chemical interaction."
