    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) assessed for their health risk quotients (HQ) in photocopy centers. While the HQ for toluene and ethylbenzene were reported to be below reference levels, indicating lower risk, the study primarily focuses on benzene as the main contributor to total risk. There is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their classification as VOCs."
