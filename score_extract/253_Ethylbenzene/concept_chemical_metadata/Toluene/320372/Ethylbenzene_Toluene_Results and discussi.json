    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of the BTEX group, which are analyzed for their partitioning behavior in a polymer phase versus an aqueous phase. The study highlights that ethylbenzene has a higher partition coefficient compared to toluene, indicating that it is more effectively retained in the polymer phase. This suggests a comparative relationship in their behavior during the study, although the focus is primarily on their individual properties rather than a direct interaction between the two compounds."
