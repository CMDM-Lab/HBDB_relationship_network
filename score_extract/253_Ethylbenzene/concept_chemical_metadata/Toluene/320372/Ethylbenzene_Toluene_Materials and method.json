    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of the BTEX group, which refers to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. The study focuses on measuring their concentrations in different phases (aqueous and polymer) within a bioreactor system. While they are analyzed together, the context does not provide specific interactions or functional relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the same analytical framework."
