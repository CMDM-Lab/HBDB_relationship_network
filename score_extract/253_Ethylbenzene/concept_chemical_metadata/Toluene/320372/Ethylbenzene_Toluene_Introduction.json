    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as components of the BTEX group, which consists of volatile organic compounds commonly emitted in the petroleum industry. The discussion highlights their collective presence in gaseous waste streams and the health implications for individuals exposed to these compounds, particularly runners near roadways.
