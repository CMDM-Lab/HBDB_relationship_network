    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored for environmental exposure levels. The study involves biomonitoring toluene exposure through urine samples, where hippuric acid serves as a biomarker. While both compounds are analyzed in the same environmental context, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not discussed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship."
