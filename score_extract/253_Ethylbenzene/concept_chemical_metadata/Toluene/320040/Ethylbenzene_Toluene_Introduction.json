    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are being investigated for their impact on CYP2E1 enzymatic activity in tannery workers. The study aims to explore how occupational exposure to these solvents affects CYP2E1, highlighting their potential role in workplace exposure scenarios. While both compounds are mentioned in relation to CYP2E1 activity, the specific interactions or comparative effects between ethylbenzene and toluene are not deeply analyzed, focusing instead on their collective impact on enzyme activity."
