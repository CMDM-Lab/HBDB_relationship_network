    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. They are part of a broader group of chemicals (BTEX) that pose potential hazards in contaminated sites targeted for environmental assessment and remediation. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs."
