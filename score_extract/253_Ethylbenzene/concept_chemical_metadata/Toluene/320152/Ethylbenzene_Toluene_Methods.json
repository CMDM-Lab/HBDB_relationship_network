    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) assessed for their health risks through inhalation exposure. The study calculates Hazard Quotients (HQs) and Hazard Indices (HIs) for these compounds, indicating their potential non-carcinogenic effects when exposed simultaneously. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and toluene is not elaborated beyond their inclusion in the same risk assessment framework."
