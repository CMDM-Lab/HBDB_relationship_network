    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) primarily originating from vehicle exhausts. The study highlights the concentration levels of these compounds in various locations in Hong Kong, noting that toluene has the highest concentration among VOCs. The T/B ratio indicates a higher prevalence of toluene relative to ethylbenzene in Hong Kong compared to other cities, suggesting a significant relationship in their sources and environmental impact."
