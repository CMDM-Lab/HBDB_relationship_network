    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed in relation to their roles in ambient air quality and pollution source differentiation. The Toluene/Benzene (T/B) and Xylene/Ethylbenzene (X/E) ratios are highlighted as analytical tools for assessing the photochemical reactivity and age of air masses. Ethylbenzene is characterized as a low reactivity species, while toluene is part of the more reactive BTEX group, indicating their differing roles in atmospheric chemistry and pollution dynamics."
