    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their method detection limits (MDLs) in various industrial settings. They are part of a group of compounds (BTEX) that are commonly monitored due to their environmental and health impacts. However, the context does not provide specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs and their inclusion in calibration curves for analytical methods."
