    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit high loadings in a principal component analysis (PCA) of measured data. They are grouped together in the analysis, indicating a shared variance in their behavior or properties within the dataset. However, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their statistical association in the PCA results."
