    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) system, which is significant for environmental studies related to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the text primarily focuses on the methodology of sampling and storage of these VOCs rather than detailing any specific interactions or relationships between ethylbenzene and toluene themselves. Their mention is more about their inclusion in a broader category of VOCs rather than a direct connection."
