    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both components of the BTEX group, which refers to a class of volatile organic compounds. The study discusses the repeatability of capillary extractions for these compounds, indicating that both ethylbenzene and toluene exhibit similar extraction efficiencies and stability during storage. However, the relationship is primarily based on their classification as BTEX compounds rather than any specific interaction or functional relationship between them."
