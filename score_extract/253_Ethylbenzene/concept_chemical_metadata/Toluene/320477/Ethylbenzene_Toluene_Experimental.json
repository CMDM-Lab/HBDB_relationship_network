    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their presence in air samples using different sampling methods. The study highlights a comparative analysis showing excellent agreement (95%) in the results for these VOCs when sampled side-by-side. However, it does not delve into their specific interactions or functional relationships beyond their co-analysis as part of VOC measurements."
