    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that exhibit strong correlations in their ambient distributions, particularly in a landfill environment. The correlation analysis indicates that these compounds, along with xylene, share similar physicochemical properties and display significant statistical relationships, suggesting they may behave similarly in terms of spatial distribution and environmental impact."
