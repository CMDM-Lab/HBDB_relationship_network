    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) effectively eliminated using biofiltration technology. The studies referenced highlight their presence in contaminated gas streams and their removal through biological treatment processes. While both compounds are mentioned in relation to biofiltration, the context does not detail their specific interactions or comparative significance beyond their shared application in VOC removal."
