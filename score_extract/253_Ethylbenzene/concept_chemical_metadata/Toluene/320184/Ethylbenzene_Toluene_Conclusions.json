    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as common aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in municipal wastewater treatment systems. The study highlights that toluene exhibited the highest concentrations among the VOCs analyzed, while ethylbenzene and other compounds had lower concentrations. Both compounds are part of the broader investigation into the treatment and fate of aromatic organic compounds in activated-sludge plants and membrane bioreactors, indicating their relevance in the same environmental context."
