    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as target aromatic compounds within the broader group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in wastewater treatment plants (WTPs). They are part of the BTEXS group, which is commonly monitored due to its environmental and health implications. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative significance between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their classification as VOCs in the study."
