    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in blood samples using a solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) method. They are included in a list of BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene) analytes, indicating they are part of the same analytical process. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance within the study."
