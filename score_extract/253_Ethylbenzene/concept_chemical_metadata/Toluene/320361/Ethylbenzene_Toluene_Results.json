    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured during a field experiment assessing BTEX exposure levels. The cumulative inhaled mass of both compounds was estimated during exercise and at rest, indicating their presence in the environment and potential health implications due to inhalation exposure. However, the context does not elaborate on any specific interactions or comparative effects between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their co-occurrence in the exposure assessment."
