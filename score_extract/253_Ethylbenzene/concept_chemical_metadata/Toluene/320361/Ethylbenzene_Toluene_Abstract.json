    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured in the blood of runners exposed to environmental BTEX levels during high-intensity exercise. The study reports significant increases in blood levels of both compounds post-exercise, indicating a direct relationship in terms of exposure and physiological response during activities in polluted areas. However, the specific interactions or comparative effects of ethylbenzene and toluene on health are not detailed."
