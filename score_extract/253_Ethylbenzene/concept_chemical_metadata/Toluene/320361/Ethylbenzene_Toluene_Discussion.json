    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with established threshold limit values (TLVs) for occupational exposure. While both are associated with potential health effects, including neurological impairment and irritation, ethylbenzene is specifically noted as a possible human carcinogen, contrasting with toluene's lower risk classification. Their relationship is highlighted through their shared context of health implications in environmental exposure, particularly for individuals exercising near roadways."
