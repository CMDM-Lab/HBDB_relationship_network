    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as part of the BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) group of volatile organic compounds. The observed concentrations of these compounds were analyzed in relation to environmental factors, such as the operation of heavy machinery and diesel vehicles. While they are grouped together and trends in their concentrations are noted, there is no specific discussion of their direct interaction or individual significance beyond their presence in the same sampling areas."
