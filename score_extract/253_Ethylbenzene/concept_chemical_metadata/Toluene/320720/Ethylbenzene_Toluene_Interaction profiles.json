    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are discussed as components of the BTEX group, which includes benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes. The text indicates that toluene can inhibit the hematological effects of benzene, while ethylbenzene and xylenes may also reduce the carcinogenic potential of benzene through competitive metabolic interactions. However, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed, and the available toxicity data for their interactions remain indeterminate."
