    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in a study examining the ozonation process for the degradation of BTEX compounds. The analysis highlights the decomposition of these compounds during ozonation, noting that specific intermediates and final products are formed from their breakdown. While both compounds are part of the BTEX group and are analyzed together, the context does not provide a detailed interaction between ethylbenzene and toluene beyond their shared involvement in the ozonation process."
