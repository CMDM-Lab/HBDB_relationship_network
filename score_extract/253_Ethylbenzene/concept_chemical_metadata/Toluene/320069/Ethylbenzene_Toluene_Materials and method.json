    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both analyzed as part of a BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, Xylene) study using HPLC. They are mentioned in relation to their detection wavelengths during chromatographic analysis, indicating they are part of the same analytical procedure. However, there is no discussion of their chemical interactions or specific relevance beyond their inclusion in the same analytical method."
