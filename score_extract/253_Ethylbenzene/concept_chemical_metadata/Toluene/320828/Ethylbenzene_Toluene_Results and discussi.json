    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as alkylbenzenes being studied for their biodegradation kinetics in the presence of heavy metals. The research focuses on quantifying the removal rates of these compounds by microbial strains, indicating a direct relationship in terms of their degradation processes. However, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their shared role as substrates in the study."
