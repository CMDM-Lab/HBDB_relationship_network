    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being evaluated for their biodegradation by specific bacterial strains, particularly Bacillus and Pseudomonas. The study aims to model the effects of heavy metals on the biodegradation process of these compounds, indicating a direct relationship in terms of their environmental impact and microbial degradation potential. However, the specific interactions between ethylbenzene and toluene are not detailed beyond their inclusion in the same biodegradation study."
