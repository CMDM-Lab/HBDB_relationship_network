    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both analyzed as alkylbenzenes using gas chromatography to assess their concentrations in liquid samples. The study focuses on the analytical methods for measuring these compounds, indicating they are part of the same category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being evaluated for their behavior in the presence of heavy metals. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or relationships beyond their co-analysis."
