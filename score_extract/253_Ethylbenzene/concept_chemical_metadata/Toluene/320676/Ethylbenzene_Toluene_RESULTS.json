    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as significant risk factors for asthma in children exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The study highlights that increased concentrations of these compounds correlate with a higher risk of developing asthma, with toluene showing a notable increase in risk for every 10 Âµg/m3 increase in concentration. Both compounds are part of the broader category of VOCs that contribute to respiratory health risks."
