    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are significant risk factors for asthma in children. The study indicates that higher concentrations of these compounds correlate with increased asthma risk, with toluene showing a notable odds ratio for asthma development. This suggests a direct relationship between exposure to these VOCs and respiratory health outcomes."
