    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both identified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for their quantification and identification. The study focuses on the detection limits and calibration of these compounds as part of a broader analysis of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) concentrations in biogas. While they are mentioned together in the context of VOC analysis, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and toluene."
