    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are part of the BTEX group, which is analyzed for its concentration in biogas emissions. The study reports on the reduction efficiency (RE) of VOC emissions, indicating that both compounds are relevant in the context of environmental monitoring and reduction strategies for VOCs. However, their specific interactions or comparative significance are not detailed beyond their inclusion in the same analysis."
