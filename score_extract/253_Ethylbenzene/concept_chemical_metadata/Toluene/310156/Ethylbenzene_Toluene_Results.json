    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that were tested for their cytotoxic effects on human cell lines, including A549 and HepG2 cells. The study compares the toxicity of these pollutants, indicating that both compounds contribute to growth inhibition in the tested cell lines. However, the specific interactions or differences in toxicity between ethylbenzene and toluene are not elaborated upon, suggesting a general relationship as part of a broader analysis of VOC effects on cell viability."
