    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and phenanthrene are both mentioned as components of coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs), including ethylbenzene (a VOC) and phenanthrene (an SVOC). While they are both present in coal tar, the context does not elaborate on their specific interactions or shared significance beyond their common occurrence in contaminated sites."
