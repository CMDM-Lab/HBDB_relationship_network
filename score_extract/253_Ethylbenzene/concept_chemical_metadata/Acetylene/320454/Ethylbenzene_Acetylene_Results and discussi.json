    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and acetylene are both mentioned as compounds emitted from various sources, but there is no direct relationship or interaction discussed between them. Ethylbenzene is highlighted as a toxic air contaminant, while acetylene is not specifically addressed in terms of its toxicity or relevance to the other compounds listed. Their mention appears coincidental within the broader discussion of hazardous air pollutants."
