    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and phenols are both mentioned as components of coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. Coal tar contains various volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) including ethylbenzene, as well as semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) like phenols. However, the relationship between ethylbenzene and phenols is not explicitly discussed, indicating they are part of a broader category of contaminants found in contaminated sites rather than having a direct interaction or specific relevance to each other."
