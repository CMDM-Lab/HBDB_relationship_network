    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and ozone are related through the process of ozonation, where ozone is used to decompose ethylbenzene. The study indicates that while ethylbenzene is not completely decomposed at lower ozone concentrations, increasing the ozone concentration leads to its complete decomposition within a specified time frame. This highlights the effectiveness of ozone in breaking down ethylbenzene under optimized conditions."
