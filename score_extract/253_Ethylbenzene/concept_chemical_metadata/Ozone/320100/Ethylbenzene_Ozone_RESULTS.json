    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and ozone are mentioned as part of a study examining air pollutants and their correlations in children's exposure. The text indicates that various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including ethylbenzene, show positive correlations with each other, while ozone is noted to have a trend of positive correlation with NO2. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and ozone is not elaborated upon, indicating a general association rather than a direct interaction."
