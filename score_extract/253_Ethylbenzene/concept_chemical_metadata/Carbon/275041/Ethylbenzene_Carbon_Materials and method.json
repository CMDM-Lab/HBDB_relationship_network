    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is part of a synthetic organic substrate used in a bioreactor for treating petrochemical wastewater. The substrate includes a readily biodegradable carbon source, which is essential for microbial metabolism. Ethylbenzene, along with other aromatic compounds, contributes to the overall carbon content in the influent, indicating its role as a carbon source for microbial degradation processes in the bioreactor."
