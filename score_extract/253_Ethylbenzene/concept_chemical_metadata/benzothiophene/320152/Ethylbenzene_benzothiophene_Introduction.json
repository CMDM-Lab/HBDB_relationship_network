    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and benzothiophene are both mentioned as volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) found in coal tar, a by-product of the coal gasification process. They are part of a broader discussion on the environmental hazards associated with contaminated sites, particularly focusing on soil vapor and the presence of various VOCs in contaminated soils and groundwater. However, there is no specific interaction or functional relationship detailed between ethylbenzene and benzothiophene beyond their classification as VOCs present in coal tar."
