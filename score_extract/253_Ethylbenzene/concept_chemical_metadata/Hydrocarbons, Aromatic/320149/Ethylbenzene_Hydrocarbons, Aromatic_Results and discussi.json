    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is identified as an aromatic hydrocarbon, part of the BTEX group (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). The text discusses the behavior of aromatic hydrocarbons, including ethylbenzene, in aqueous solutions, highlighting their low polarity and tendency to escape from water due to their inability to form strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This establishes a clear classification of ethylbenzene within the broader category of aromatic hydrocarbons."
