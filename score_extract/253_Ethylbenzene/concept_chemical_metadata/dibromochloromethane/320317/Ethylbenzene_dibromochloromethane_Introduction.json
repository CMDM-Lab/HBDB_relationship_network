    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dibromochloromethane are both classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are mentioned in relation to their potential carcinogenicity. They are part of broader categories of soil pollutants, specifically BTEX and trihalomethanes, respectively.
