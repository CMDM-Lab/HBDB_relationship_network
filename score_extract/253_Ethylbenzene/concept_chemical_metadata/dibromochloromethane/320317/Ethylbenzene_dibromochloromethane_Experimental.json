    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and dibromochloromethane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed using a headspace autosampler and gas chromatography. They are part of a broader study aimed at determining the presence of trihalomethanes (THMs) and BTEX compounds in soil samples. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship discussed between ethylbenzene and dibromochloromethane beyond their inclusion in the same analytical methodology."
