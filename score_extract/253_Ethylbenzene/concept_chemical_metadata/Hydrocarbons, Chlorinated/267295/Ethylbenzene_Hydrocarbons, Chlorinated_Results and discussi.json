    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is categorized as an aromatic hydrocarbon, which is part of the broader group of hydrocarbons mentioned. The discussion highlights the presence of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the indoor air of plastic recycling plants, indicating a potential overlap in the types of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted during plastic production and recycling. However, the specific relationship between ethylbenzene and chlorinated hydrocarbons is not directly addressed, suggesting a more general connection rather than a detailed interaction."
