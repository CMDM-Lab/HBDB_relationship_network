    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as one of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose biodegradation is being studied in relation to the presence of heavy metals like cadmium, nickel, and zinc. The research aims to evaluate how these heavy metals affect the microbial degradation of ethylbenzene by specific bacterial strains. While the study focuses on the interaction between heavy metals and VOC biodegradation, it does not provide detailed insights into the specific mechanisms or effects of heavy metals on ethylbenzene degradation."
