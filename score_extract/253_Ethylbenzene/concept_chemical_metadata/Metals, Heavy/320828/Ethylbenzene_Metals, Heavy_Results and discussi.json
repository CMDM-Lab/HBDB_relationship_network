    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is studied alongside heavy metals to evaluate their combined effects on the biodegradation kinetics of alkylbenzenes by microbial strains Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. The presence of heavy metals is shown to inhibit the removal rates of ethylbenzene and other alkylbenzenes, indicating a significant interaction where heavy metal concentrations negatively impact microbial degradation processes. The study employs mathematical modeling to quantify these effects, highlighting the relevance of heavy metals in the biodegradation of ethylbenzene."
