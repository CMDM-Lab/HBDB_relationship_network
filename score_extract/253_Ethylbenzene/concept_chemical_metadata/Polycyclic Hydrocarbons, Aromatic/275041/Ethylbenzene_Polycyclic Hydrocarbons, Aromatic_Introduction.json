    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that, along with other compounds like benzene and toluene, is commonly emitted into the environment from fuel and petroleum products. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which include compounds like naphthalene, are also highlighted as hazardous pollutants. Both ethylbenzene and PAHs are recognized for their environmental hazards and are included in the priority substances list due to their potential carcinogenic, mutagenic, and reproductive toxicity properties. This indicates a shared concern regarding their impact on environmental health."
