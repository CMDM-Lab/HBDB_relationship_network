    "summary": "In this context, ethylbenzene and pentane are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected during ambient atmospheric measurements at a specific site. While they are part of a broader analysis of VOC concentrations, there is no direct discussion of their relationship or interaction. Their presence is noted in the context of air quality monitoring, particularly in relation to potential sources like fuel components, but no specific functional or chemical relationship is established between them."
