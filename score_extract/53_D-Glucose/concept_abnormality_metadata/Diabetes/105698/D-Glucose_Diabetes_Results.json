    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is directly related to diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), as glucose levels are critical in diagnosing and managing the condition. The study discusses how T2D patients are classified based on their glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and fasting measurements. The relationship is underscored by the mention of improved glucose levels post-surgery, indicating the importance of glucose regulation in diabetes management."
