    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to diabetes through its role in gestational diabetes and the impact of maternal glucose levels on fetal growth. The study highlights the increased incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants born to mothers with type 1 diabetes, suggesting that elevated glucose levels during pregnancy contribute to fetal macrosomia and associated health risks, including future diabetes in offspring. This indicates a significant connection between glucose metabolism and diabetes outcomes."
