    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and hyperinsulinism are related through the metabolic processes influenced by visceral fat (VF). The release of free fatty acids from the intraperitoneal fat depot disrupts hepatic glucose metabolism, leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This indicates that alterations in glucose metabolism can directly contribute to hyperinsulinism, highlighting a significant metabolic interaction between the two."
