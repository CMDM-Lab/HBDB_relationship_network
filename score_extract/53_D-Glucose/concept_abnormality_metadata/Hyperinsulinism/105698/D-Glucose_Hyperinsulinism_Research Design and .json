    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and hyperinsulinism are closely related through the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, which is used to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. During hyperinsulinemia, plasma glucose levels are maintained at a specific concentration, indicating a direct interaction where insulin regulates glucose levels in the bloodstream. This relationship is critical for understanding metabolic responses in conditions like hyperinsulinism."
