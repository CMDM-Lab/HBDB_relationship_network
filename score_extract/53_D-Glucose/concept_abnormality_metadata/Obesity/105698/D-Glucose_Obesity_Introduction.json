    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and obesity are interconnected through the study of metabolic changes following bariatric surgery in severely obese patients. The research aims to assess how bariatric surgery affects glucose uptake in different adipose tissue compartments, highlighting the role of glucose metabolism in obesity management and the potential for improved metabolic profiles post-surgery. This suggests a significant relationship between glucose metabolism and obesity, particularly in the context of surgical interventions aimed at weight loss."
