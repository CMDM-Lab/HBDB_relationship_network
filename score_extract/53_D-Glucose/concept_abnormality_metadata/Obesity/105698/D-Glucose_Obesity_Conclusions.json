    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and obesity are related through the metabolic variations observed in obese patients. The study highlights that bariatric surgery enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and fat compartments, indicating a significant interaction between glucose metabolism and obesity. This suggests that managing glucose levels may be crucial in addressing obesity-related metabolic issues."
