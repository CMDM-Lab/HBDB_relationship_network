    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and obesity are interconnected through the discussion of glucose metabolism and its relationship with body fat distribution. The text highlights that severe obesity affects insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization, particularly in muscle tissue. Bariatric surgery improves glucose metabolism in morbidly obese patients, indicating that obesity significantly impacts glucose handling in the body. The accumulation of visceral and subcutaneous fat is noted as a contributing factor to obesity and its metabolic consequences, including altered glucose metabolism."
