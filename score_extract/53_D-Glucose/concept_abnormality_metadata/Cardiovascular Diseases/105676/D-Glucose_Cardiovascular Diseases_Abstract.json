    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to cardiovascular diseases through its association with type 1 diabetes and fetal macrosomia. High birth weight (LGA) in infants born to diabetic mothers is linked to future risks of overweight, impaired glucose tolerance, and cardiovascular disease. This suggests that elevated glucose levels during pregnancy may contribute to long-term cardiovascular risks in offspring."
