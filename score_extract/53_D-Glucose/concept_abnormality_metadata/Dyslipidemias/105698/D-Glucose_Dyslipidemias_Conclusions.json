    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to dyslipidemias through the discussion of insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal in obese patients. The text highlights that impaired glucose tolerance and the inability of adipose tissue to expand contribute to dyslipidemia. Thus, while D-Glucose levels are affected by insulin resistance, the relationship with dyslipidemias is more about the metabolic consequences of glucose handling in obesity rather than a direct interaction."
