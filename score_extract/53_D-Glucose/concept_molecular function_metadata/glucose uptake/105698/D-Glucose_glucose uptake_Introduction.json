    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to glucose uptake (GU) as the study investigates the effects of bariatric surgery on metabolism, specifically focusing on how it influences GU in different adipose tissue compartments in severely obese patients. The assessment of glucose uptake is crucial for understanding metabolic changes post-surgery, particularly in relation to D-Glucose levels, although the specific mechanisms or direct interactions are not detailed in the provided context."
