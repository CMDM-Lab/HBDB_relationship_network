    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin resistance are interconnected through the discussion of glucose disposal mechanisms in obese patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite insulin resistance, the expansion of visceral fat (VF) in obese individuals allows for increased glucose disposal, preventing further accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream. This suggests that while insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism, the body's compensatory mechanisms, such as fat expansion, play a crucial role in managing glucose levels."
