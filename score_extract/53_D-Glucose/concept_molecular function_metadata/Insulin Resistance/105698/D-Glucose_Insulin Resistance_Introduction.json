    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin resistance are related through the metabolic effects of visceral fat (VF) accumulation. The release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from intraperitoneal fat interferes with hepatic glucose metabolism, leading to hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. This suggests that disturbances in glucose metabolism are closely linked to the presence of insulin resistance, particularly in the context of obesity-related metabolic abnormalities."
