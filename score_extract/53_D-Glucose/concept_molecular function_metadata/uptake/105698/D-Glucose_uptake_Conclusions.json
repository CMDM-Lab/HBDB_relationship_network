    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to uptake through the discussion of glucose utilization in adipose tissue and other cells, as assessed by [18F]-FDG PET imaging. The mention of higher fasting FDG uptake suggests that glucose uptake is being evaluated in relation to metabolic complications, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and insulin resistance. However, the specific relationship between D-Glucose and uptake is not explicitly detailed."
