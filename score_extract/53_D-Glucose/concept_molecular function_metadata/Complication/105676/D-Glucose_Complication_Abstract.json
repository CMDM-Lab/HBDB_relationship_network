    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to complications arising from pregnancies in type 1 diabetic mothers. The high levels of D-Glucose associated with poor metabolic control can lead to fetal macrosomia, which is linked to increased risks of obstetric and perinatal complications. The study highlights the worrying trend of rising fetal macrosomia rates despite good metabolic control, indicating a complex relationship between glucose levels and pregnancy complications."
