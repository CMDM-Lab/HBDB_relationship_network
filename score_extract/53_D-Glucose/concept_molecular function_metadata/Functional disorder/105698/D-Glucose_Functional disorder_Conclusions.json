    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to functional disorders through its association with insulin sensitivity and metabolic dysfunction in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study highlights how impaired glucose utilization (GU) in visceral fat (VF) tissues correlates with elevated glucose levels and functional impairments in insulin action, indicating a link between glucose metabolism and functional disorders in obesity and T2D."
