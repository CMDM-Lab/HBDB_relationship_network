    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is directly related to glucose metabolism, particularly in the setting of bariatric surgery and its effects on tissue-specific glucose utilization (GU) in morbidly obese patients. The study highlights how visceral and subcutaneous fat influence glucose metabolism, indicating that D-Glucose levels and metabolism are critical in understanding insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health in conditions like Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)."
