    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to glucose metabolism as the text discusses how free fatty acids (FFAs) from intraperitoneal fat affect hepatic glucose metabolism, leading to conditions like hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. While D-Glucose is not explicitly mentioned as a substrate in this metabolic process, its role as a primary energy source in glucose metabolism is implied through the discussion of metabolic disturbances caused by fat distribution."
