    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to glucose metabolism as the study discusses glucose uptake (GU) in various tissues, particularly in the context of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The findings indicate that decreased GU in skeletal muscle and fat compartments is linked to impaired glucose metabolism, highlighting the role of D-Glucose as a substrate in these metabolic processes. However, the specific role of D-Glucose itself is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the overall glucose metabolism in different fat depots and muscle tissues."
