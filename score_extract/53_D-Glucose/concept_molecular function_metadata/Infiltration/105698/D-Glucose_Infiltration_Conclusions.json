    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to infiltration through its role in metabolic processes and inflammation. The study discusses how higher fasting FDG uptake, which indicates glucose utilization, is associated with infiltrating macrophages in adipose tissue. This suggests that glucose metabolism is linked to inflammatory infiltration in tissues, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its metabolic complications."
