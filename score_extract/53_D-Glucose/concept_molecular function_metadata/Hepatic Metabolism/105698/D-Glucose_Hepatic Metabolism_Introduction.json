    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to hepatic metabolism through the discussion of how free fatty acids (FFAs) from visceral fat (VF) affect glucose metabolism in the liver. The release of FFAs interferes with hepatic glucose metabolism, leading to conditions such as hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, which are critical in understanding metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity. While D-Glucose is not explicitly mentioned as being metabolized, its metabolism is implied to be affected by the hepatic processes discussed."
