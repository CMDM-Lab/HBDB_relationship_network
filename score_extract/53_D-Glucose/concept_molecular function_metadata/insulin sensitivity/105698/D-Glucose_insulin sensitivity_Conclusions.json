    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin sensitivity are interconnected through the discussion of glucose disposal in obese patients. Despite insulin resistance, the expansion of subcutaneous (SC) fat allows for glucose uptake, which helps prevent further glucose accumulation in the bloodstream. The study highlights that weight loss improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, indicating a direct relationship between D-Glucose levels and the body's ability to respond to insulin effectively."
