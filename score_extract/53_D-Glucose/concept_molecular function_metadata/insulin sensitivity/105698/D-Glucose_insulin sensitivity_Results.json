    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose and insulin sensitivity are related through their roles in the metabolic parameters of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients. Although glucose levels improved post-surgery, whole-body insulin sensitivity remained subnormal in both T2D and non-diabetic (ND) groups. This suggests that while glucose control is essential, it does not fully restore insulin sensitivity, indicating a complex relationship between glucose metabolism and insulin action in T2D."
