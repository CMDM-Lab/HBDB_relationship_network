    "summary": "In this context, D-Glucose is indirectly related to glucose tolerance, as the discussion revolves around glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity in obese patients. The text highlights how fat expansion in obesity affects glucose levels and tolerance, indicating that D-Glucose levels can influence glucose tolerance through mechanisms involving insulin resistance and adipose tissue function. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the broader implications of glucose metabolism in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)."
