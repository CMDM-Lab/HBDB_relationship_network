    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and the HOXA10 gene are mentioned in a discussion about a multi-phase compositional model, but there is no direct relationship or interaction between them. TCE is referenced as a component in a model concerning environmental factors, while HOXA10 gene is not discussed in relation to TCE or its effects. Thus, their connection is purely coincidental without any biological or chemical relevance."
