    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its bioremediation through microbial processes, specifically reductive dechlorination. However, there is no mention or connection to the EEF1A2 gene, which is typically associated with protein synthesis and cellular functions. The two terms appear in the same context but lack any direct or indirect relationship."
