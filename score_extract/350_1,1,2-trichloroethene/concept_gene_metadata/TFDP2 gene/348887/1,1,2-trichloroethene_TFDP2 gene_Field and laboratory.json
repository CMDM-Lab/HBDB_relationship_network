    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to hydrogeochemical sampling and analysis, while the TFDP2 gene is not directly referenced or linked to TCE. The context focuses on environmental monitoring and chemical quantification without discussing any biological implications or interactions involving the TFDP2 gene. Therefore, there is no evident relationship between the two terms."
