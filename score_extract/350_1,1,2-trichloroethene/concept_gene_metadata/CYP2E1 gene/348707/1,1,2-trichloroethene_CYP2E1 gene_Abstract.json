    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is primarily metabolized by the CYP2E1 gene, which encodes a key enzyme in the CYP450 family responsible for the oxidative biotransformation of TCE. This metabolic pathway is crucial for modulating the toxicity and carcinogenicity of TCE, particularly at low doses, highlighting the significant role of CYP2E1 in TCE's toxicokinetics and effects on various organs."
