    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is metabolized primarily by the CYP2E1 gene, which is responsible for its oxidation at low doses in both rats and humans. The text discusses the role of CYP2E1 in the metabolic activation of TCE, highlighting its significance in the pulmonary first-pass effect and the limited metabolic activation in human lungs compared to rats. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and the CYP2E1 gene in the context of its metabolism."
