    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is metabolized by the CYP2E1 gene, which is overexpressed in genetically modified hybrid poplar plants. The study highlights that these transgenic plants exhibit significantly enhanced metabolism of TCE, with a 100-fold increase compared to non-transgenic controls. This indicates a direct and critical relationship between TCE and the CYP2E1 gene, as the gene's expression is essential for the enhanced degradation of this volatile toxic compound."
