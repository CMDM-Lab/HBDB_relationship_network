    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile toxic compound that is metabolized by transgenic plants overexpressing the mammalian cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). However, the FASTK gene is not directly discussed or linked to the metabolism of TCE or the transgenic modifications described. The focus is primarily on the CYP2E1 enzyme's role in enhancing TCE metabolism, with no clear connection to the FASTK gene."
