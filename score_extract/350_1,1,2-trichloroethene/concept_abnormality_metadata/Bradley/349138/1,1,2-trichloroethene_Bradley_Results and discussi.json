    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to redox conditions that influence its natural attenuation and potential dechlorination processes. Bradley is referenced in the context of a study on these redox conditions, indicating a connection to the understanding of TCE behavior in anaerobic environments. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, and Bradley's role appears more as a citation rather than a direct interaction with TCE."
