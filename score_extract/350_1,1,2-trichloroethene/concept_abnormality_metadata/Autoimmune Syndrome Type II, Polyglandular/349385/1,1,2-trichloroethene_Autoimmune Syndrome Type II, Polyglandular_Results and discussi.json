    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its environmental presence and biodegradation processes, with no mention of Autoimmune Syndrome Type II, Polyglandular. The focus is on the isotopic analysis of TCE in groundwater, indicating its degradation patterns, which do not connect to autoimmune conditions or their mechanisms. Thus, there is no relevant relationship between TCE and the autoimmune syndrome in this context."
