    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to solvent mass loss during a purging process. The discussion focuses on optimizing gas-solvent phase mass transfer efficiency and the effects of sampling volume on solvent loss. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relevance between TCE and the purging process beyond the general mention of solvent behavior during purging."
