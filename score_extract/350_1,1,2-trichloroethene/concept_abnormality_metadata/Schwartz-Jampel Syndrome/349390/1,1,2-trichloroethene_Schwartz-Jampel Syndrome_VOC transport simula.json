    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its chemical reaction kinetics and pH-dependent behavior, but there is no mention or connection to Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome. The focus is solely on the chemical properties and modeling of TCE, with no biological or medical implications related to Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder affecting muscle and skeletal development."
