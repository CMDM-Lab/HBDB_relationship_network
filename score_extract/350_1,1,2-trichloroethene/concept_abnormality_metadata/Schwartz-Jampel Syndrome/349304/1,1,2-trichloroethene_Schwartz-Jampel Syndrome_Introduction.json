    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its remediation through in-situ chemical oxidation and bioremediation techniques. However, there is no mention or connection to Schwartz-Jampel Syndrome, which is a genetic disorder affecting muscle function. The two terms appear in the same context but are unrelated in terms of chemical or biological interactions."
