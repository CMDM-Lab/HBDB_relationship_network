    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its concentrations in environmental samples, particularly in streams affected by plume discharge. However, there is no mention or discussion of spastic syndrome, which is a neurological condition. The two terms appear in the same context but lack any direct or indirect relationship, as the focus is solely on TCE's environmental impact without any reference to health effects or conditions like spastic syndrome."
