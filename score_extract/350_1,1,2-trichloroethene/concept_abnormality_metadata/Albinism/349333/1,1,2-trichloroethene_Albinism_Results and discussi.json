    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its dissolution kinetics in water, particularly influenced by pH and biosurfactants. However, there is no mention or connection to albinism, which is a genetic condition characterized by a lack of melanin. The two terms appear in the same context but are unrelated in terms of chemical or biological significance."
