    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned alongside various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their hydrolysis rates, including halogenated aldehydes. However, there is no direct discussion of the relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and aldehydes, as the focus is primarily on hydrolysis half-lives of different VOCs without specific interactions or comparisons made between them."
