    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being treated through oxidation with permanganate, which is associated with manganese oxide. The study indicates that the incomplete oxidation of TCE is partly due to pore clogging by solid manganese oxides, suggesting a direct interaction where manganese oxide affects the efficiency of TCE treatment. This highlights the role of manganese oxide in the oxidation process of TCE, indicating a significant relationship between the two substances in the context of environmental remediation."
