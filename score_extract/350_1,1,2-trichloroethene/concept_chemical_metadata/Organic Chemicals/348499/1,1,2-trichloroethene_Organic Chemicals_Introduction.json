    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that contributes to environmental contamination, particularly in soils and groundwater. The discussion focuses on the challenges of containing TCE and other organic chemicals using high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes, which are designed to mitigate the permeation of such hazardous organic chemicals. The relationship is primarily centered on TCE being a specific example of organic chemicals that pose environmental risks."
