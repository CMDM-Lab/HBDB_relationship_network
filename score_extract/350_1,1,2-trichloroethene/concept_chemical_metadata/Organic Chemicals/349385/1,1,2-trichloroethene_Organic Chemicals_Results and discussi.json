    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as an organic chemical that is subject to biodegradation by specific bacteria, such as Geobacter and Nitrosomonas. These bacteria are involved in the reductive dechlorination process, converting TCE into less harmful compounds like cis-DCE and VC. The study highlights the role of these organic chemicals in environmental bioremediation, emphasizing their significance in microbial degradation pathways."
