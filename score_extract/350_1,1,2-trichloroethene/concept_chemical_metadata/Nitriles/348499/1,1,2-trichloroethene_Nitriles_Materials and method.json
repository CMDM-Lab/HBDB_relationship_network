    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its mass transfer through a geomembrane, while nitriles are referenced in the context of the gasket material used to minimize absorption and loss of TCE. However, there is no direct discussion of a chemical or functional relationship between TCE and nitriles, indicating that they are only connected through the experimental setup rather than through any inherent chemical interaction or biological significance."
