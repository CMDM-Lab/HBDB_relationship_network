    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and ozone are discussed in relation to their roles in photodegradation processes. The study indicates that while ozone and other reactive oxygen species may be present, their contribution to the oxidation of TCE is not significant compared to the direct photolysis and Cl-initiated reactions. Thus, the relationship between TCE and ozone is minimal, as ozone does not play a critical role in TCE degradation under the experimental conditions described."
