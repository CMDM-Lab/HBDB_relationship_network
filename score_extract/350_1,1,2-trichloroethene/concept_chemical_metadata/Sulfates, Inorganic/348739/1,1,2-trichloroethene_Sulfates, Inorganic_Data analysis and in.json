    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation processes in a plume, where the presence of inorganic sulfates is noted among other chemical constituents. The analysis indicates oxidizing conditions in the TCE plume, with detectable sulfate concentrations suggesting potential interactions in the geochemical environment. However, there is no direct discussion of how sulfates specifically affect TCE degradation or vice versa, limiting the depth of their relationship."
