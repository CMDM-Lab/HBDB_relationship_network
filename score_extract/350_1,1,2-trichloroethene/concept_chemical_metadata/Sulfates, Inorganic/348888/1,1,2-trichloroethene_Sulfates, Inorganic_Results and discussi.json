    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a parent compound in the degradation of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a riverbed, while sulfates are implied to play a role in the anaerobic dechlorination process. Specifically, the degradation of TCE under sulfate-reducing conditions leads to the formation of degradation products like cDCE. However, the relationship between TCE and inorganic sulfates is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the degradation process rather than a direct interaction."
