    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport behavior in glassy humic acids. The study highlights that the rigid state of humic acid may limit TCE's access to internal pore spaces, affecting its sorption and desorption processes. While humic acids are acknowledged as a sorption medium, their capacity is considered small compared to mineral matter, indicating a complex interaction where humic acids influence TCE transport dynamics."
