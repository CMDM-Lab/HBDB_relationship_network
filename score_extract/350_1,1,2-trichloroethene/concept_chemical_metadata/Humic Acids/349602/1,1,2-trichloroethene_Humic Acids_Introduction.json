    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its sorption behavior on humic acid-coated materials. The studies referenced indicate that humic acids can enhance the sorption of TCE onto various substrates, particularly under specific humidity conditions. The interaction between TCE and humic acids is significant for understanding the environmental fate of TCE in soil and water systems, as humic acids can influence the mobility and bioavailability of this compound."
