    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) used in experiments involving quartz sands. The study focuses on the physical properties of TCE and its interaction with different sand distributions, specifically quartz, to assess hydraulic conductivity and particle density. However, there is no direct chemical or biological interaction discussed between TCE and quartz beyond their roles in the experimental setup."
