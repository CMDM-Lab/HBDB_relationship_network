    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and quartz are mentioned in relation to an experiment investigating the evaporation of TCE enhanced by the presence of F-NZVI (functionalized nanoscale zero-valent iron) in quartz sand. The study examines how different water saturations in quartz sand affect TCE evaporation, but does not detail any direct chemical interaction between TCE and quartz itself, focusing instead on the role of F-NZVI."
