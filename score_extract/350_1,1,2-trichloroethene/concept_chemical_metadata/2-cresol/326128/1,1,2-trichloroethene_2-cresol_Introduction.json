    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and 2-cresol are indirectly related through their involvement in the degradation processes facilitated by the G4 microbial strain. While TCE mineralization is primarily induced by phenol and toluene, the mention of o-cresol and m-cresol suggests that cresols, including 2-cresol, may play a role in the broader context of TCE degradation. However, there is no direct evidence or detailed discussion linking 2-cresol specifically to TCE degradation in this study."
