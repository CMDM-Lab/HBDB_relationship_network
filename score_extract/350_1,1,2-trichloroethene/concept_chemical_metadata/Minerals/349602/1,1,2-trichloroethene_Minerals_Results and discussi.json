    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its sorption onto mineral materials, specifically using a microporous material (6X75) for sorption isotherm studies. The relationship is primarily focused on the interaction of TCE with mineral surfaces, indicating that the mineral properties may influence the sorption capacity for volatile organic compounds like TCE. However, the context does not elaborate on specific interactions or implications of this relationship beyond the experimental setup."
