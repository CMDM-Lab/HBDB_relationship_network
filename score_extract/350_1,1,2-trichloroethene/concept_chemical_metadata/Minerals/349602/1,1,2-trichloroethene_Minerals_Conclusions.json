    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its sorption behavior on mineral surfaces, particularly in the presence of water and natural organic matter (NOM). The study highlights how water influences the sorption capacity of VOCs like TCE on minerals, suggesting that the interaction between TCE and minerals is affected by the hydration state of the NOM, which alters the sorption mechanisms. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the physical interactions rather than a direct biochemical or physiological connection."
