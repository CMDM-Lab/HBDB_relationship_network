    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and Freon 22 are both mentioned as non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) sources in a study comparing their density-induced migration in different aquifer types. The research indicates that while both compounds can influence groundwater contamination, the specific interactions or comparative effects between TCE and Freon 22 are not elaborated upon, focusing instead on their individual behaviors in the context of vapor advection and diffusion."
