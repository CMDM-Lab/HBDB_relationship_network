    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is used as a model volatile organic compound (VOC) to study vapor-phase transport, while heptane serves as a partitioning tracer to characterize retention processes at the air-water interface. Both compounds are involved in evaluating VOC retention and transport mechanisms, but their specific interactions or comparative significance are not detailed beyond their roles in the experimental setup."
