    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is introduced as a compound being studied for its behavior in an aqueous phase, specifically in relation to its bioavailability when hexadecane is degraded by a hydrocarbon-degrading microorganism (HDM). Distilled water is used as the solvent for preparing chloride standards, indicating its role in the experimental setup. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship between TCE and distilled water beyond its use as a medium for the experiment."
