    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and cyclopentane are mentioned in relation to their roles as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a method for analyzing organic compounds. Cyclopentane is noted as a suitable solvent for large volume injection (LVI) techniques, which are not appropriate for 1,1,2-trichloroethene due to their similar boiling points. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship discussed between the two compounds beyond their mention in the context of solvent selection for VOC analysis."
