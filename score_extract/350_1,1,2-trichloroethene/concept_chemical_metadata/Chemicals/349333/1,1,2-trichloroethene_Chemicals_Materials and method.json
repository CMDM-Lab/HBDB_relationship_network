    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as one of the specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being studied for its vapor dissolution and diffusion into water. The term 'chemicals' broadly encompasses TCE and other substances used in the experiments, indicating that TCE is a specific example within the larger category of chemicals being investigated for their environmental behavior and interactions in aqueous systems. However, there is no detailed discussion of TCE's unique properties or interactions with other chemicals beyond its inclusion in the study."
