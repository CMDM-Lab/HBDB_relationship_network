    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that undergoes biotransformation primarily in the liver, with implications for its toxicity in various tissues. The text highlights the protective mechanisms against the harmful effects of TCE and other chemicals, indicating that TCE is part of a broader category of chemicals that can have significant biological impacts. However, the relationship is more about TCE's classification as a chemical rather than a direct interaction with other chemicals."
