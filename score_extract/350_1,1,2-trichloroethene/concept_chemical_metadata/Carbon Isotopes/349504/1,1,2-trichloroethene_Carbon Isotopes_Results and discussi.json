    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to carbon isotopes, specifically regarding the phenomenon of isotope fractionation during sampling processes. The text highlights that TCE exhibits strong carbon isotope fractionation when using certain sorbents, which is significant for understanding its behavior in environmental monitoring. This relationship is crucial for accurate analysis in studies involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their isotopic signatures."
