    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a solvent used in carbon isotope analysis. The analysis involves adding a specific amount of TCE into water for measurement using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). However, there is no detailed discussion on how TCE's properties or behavior relate specifically to carbon isotopes beyond its use in the calibration and analysis process."
