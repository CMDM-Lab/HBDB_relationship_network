    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by the genus Geobacter, which is involved in the reductive dechlorination process. The study notes a correlation between the presence of Geobacter and shifts in the carbon isotope composition of TCE and its degradation products, indicating that carbon isotopes can serve as indicators of microbial activity and the transformation of TCE in the environment."
