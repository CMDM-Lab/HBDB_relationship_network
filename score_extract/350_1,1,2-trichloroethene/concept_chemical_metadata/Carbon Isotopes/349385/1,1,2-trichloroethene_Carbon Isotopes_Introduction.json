    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using compound-specific carbon isotope analysis (CSIA) to investigate biodegradation processes. The study employs carbon isotope ratios to differentiate between TCE and its degradation products, indicating the role of microbial communities in the degradation of contaminants. However, the relationship between TCE and carbon isotopes is primarily methodological, focusing on isotope analysis rather than a direct interaction between the two terms."
