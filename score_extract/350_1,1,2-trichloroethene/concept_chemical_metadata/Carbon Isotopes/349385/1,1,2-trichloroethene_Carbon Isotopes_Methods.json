    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed for its carbon isotope composition, specifically δ13C values, which are crucial for understanding its source and behavior in the environment. The δ13C values of TCE are measured relative to a standard, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and carbon isotopes in the context of environmental monitoring and analysis. However, the relationship is primarily analytical rather than biological or chemical in nature."
