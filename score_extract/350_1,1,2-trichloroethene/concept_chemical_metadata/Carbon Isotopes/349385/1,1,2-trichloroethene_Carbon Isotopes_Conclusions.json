    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is linked to carbon isotopes through the study of microbial groundwater communities that facilitate the biodegradation of chlorinated ethenes. The research indicates a correlation between the presence of dechlorinating bacteria and shifts in the carbon isotope composition of TCE and its degradation products, suggesting that microbial activity influences the isotopic signature of these compounds during reductive dechlorination processes."
