    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation and transformation in groundwater, with carbon isotope data being used to provide evidence of these processes. The isotopic analysis helps to track the degradation pathways of TCE and its byproducts, indicating that carbon isotopes can serve as markers for understanding the extent of TCE transformation and plume attenuation in the environment. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the use of carbon isotopes as a tool for studying TCE rather than a direct interaction between the two terms."
