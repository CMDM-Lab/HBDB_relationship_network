    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation in the environment, with carbon isotope data being used to support the investigation of its degradation pathways. The carbon isotopes provide insights into the processes affecting TCE and its degradation products, indicating that isotopic analysis can help trace the fate of these volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and surface water interactions. However, the specific relationship between TCE and carbon isotopes is not elaborated in detail beyond their association in the study of degradation processes."
