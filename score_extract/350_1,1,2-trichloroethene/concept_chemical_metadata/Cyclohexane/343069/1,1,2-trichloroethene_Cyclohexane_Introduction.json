    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and cyclohexane are mentioned as part of a discussion on the use of organic solvents in the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Cyclohexane is highlighted as a suitable solvent for unpolar compounds, while 1,1,2-trichloroethene is referenced in relation to its boiling point and compatibility with large volume injection techniques. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship established between the two compounds beyond their roles as solvents in analytical chemistry."
