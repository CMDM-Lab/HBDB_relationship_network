    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed in relation to water specimens collected from monitoring wells. The study focuses on the carbon isotope analysis of TCE concentrations in water, indicating a potential environmental contamination issue. However, the relationship is primarily analytical, with no direct biological or chemical interaction discussed between TCE and the water specimens beyond their co-analysis."
