    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its interactions with chlorine atoms during catalytic processes. The text highlights how the presence of chlorine atoms affects catalyst deactivation and the formation of metal chlorides. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the chemical behavior of TCE rather than a direct interaction with the concept of 'atom' itself, which is a fundamental unit of matter."
