    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes involving hydroxyl radicals, which are reactive species that can interact with various atoms and molecules. However, the term 'Atom' is mentioned in a general sense without specific reference to its role or relationship with TCE. The context primarily focuses on the chemical reactions involving TCE and hydroxyl radicals rather than a direct connection to the concept of an atom."
