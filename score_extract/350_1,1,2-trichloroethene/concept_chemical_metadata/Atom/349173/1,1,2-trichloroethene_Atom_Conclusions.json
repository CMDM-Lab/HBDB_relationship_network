    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes, which involve the interaction of its molecular structure with light and reactive species. However, the term 'Atom' is mentioned in a general sense, referring to the fundamental units of matter that make up TCE and other compounds. There is no specific discussion of how TCE interacts with atoms beyond its molecular structure, making the relationship very indirect."
