    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned in relation to the byproducts formed during a chemical reaction involving VOCs in a plasma reactor. However, the term 'Atom' appears to refer to atomic carbon, which is discussed in the context of carbon loss during the reaction. There is no direct relationship established between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and atomic carbon, as the focus is on the byproducts and their formation rather than a specific interaction between the two terms."
