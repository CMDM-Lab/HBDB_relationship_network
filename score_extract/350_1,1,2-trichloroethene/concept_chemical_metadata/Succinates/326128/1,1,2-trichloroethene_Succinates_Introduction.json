    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and succinates are mentioned in relation to the growth conditions of Burkholderia cepacia strain G4, which degrades TCE. The presence of succinate, along with other carbon sources like acetate and glucose, inhibited TCE degradation by G4. This indicates that while succinates are part of the growth media, they negatively impact the organism's ability to degrade TCE, suggesting a competitive relationship rather than a direct interaction."
