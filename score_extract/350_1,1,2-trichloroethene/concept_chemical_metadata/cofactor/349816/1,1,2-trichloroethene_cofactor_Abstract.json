    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being studied for its metabolism in rat hepatic microsomal preparations, where cofactors are utilized to facilitate this metabolic process. The experiments aim to assess how different fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acid, influence TCE metabolism, indicating that cofactors play a crucial role in the enzymatic activity related to TCE processing. However, the specific interactions between TCE and the cofactors are not elaborated in detail."
