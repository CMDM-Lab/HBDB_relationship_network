    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned alongside chlorinated alkanes like chloroform and carbon tetrachloride as model compounds for studying degradation pathways of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While TCE is a chlorinated alkene, the mention of alkanes indicates a broader category of compounds being investigated for their degradation mechanisms. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, focusing more on the experimental setup rather than a direct interaction between TCE and alkanes."
