    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is categorized as a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon (CAH), which is a subset of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Alkanes, on the other hand, are a broader class of hydrocarbons that do not include chlorinated compounds. While both terms relate to organic compounds, their specific classifications and chemical properties differ significantly, indicating only a loose connection through their shared categorization as hydrocarbons."
