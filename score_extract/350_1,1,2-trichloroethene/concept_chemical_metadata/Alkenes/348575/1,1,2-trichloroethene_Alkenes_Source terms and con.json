    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is classified as a chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon (CAH), which falls under the broader category of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Alkenes, as a class of hydrocarbons characterized by at least one carbon-carbon double bond, are mentioned in relation to chlorinated compounds. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and alkenes is not elaborated upon, indicating a general categorization rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship."
