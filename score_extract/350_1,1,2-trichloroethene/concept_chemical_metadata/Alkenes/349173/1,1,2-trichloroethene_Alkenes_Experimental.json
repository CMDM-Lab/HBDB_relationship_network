    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a chlorinated alkene selected for degradation studies alongside other chlorinated compounds. The focus is on understanding the degradation pathways of TCE and similar volatile organic compounds (VOCs) within the same chemical category. While TCE is classified as an alkene due to its carbon-carbon double bond, the relationship is primarily based on its inclusion in a study of degradation mechanisms rather than a direct interaction or functional relationship with alkenes in general."
