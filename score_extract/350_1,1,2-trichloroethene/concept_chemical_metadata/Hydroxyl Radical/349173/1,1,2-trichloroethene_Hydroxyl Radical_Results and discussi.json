    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation process, which is significantly influenced by the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH). The study highlights that hydroxyl radicals are generated from the reaction of O(1D) with water, and they play a crucial role in the degradation of TCE and chloroform. The increased rate of TCE degradation in moist air indicates a direct interaction where hydroxyl radicals react with TCE, enhancing its breakdown in the environment."
