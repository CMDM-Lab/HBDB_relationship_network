    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and steam are related through their interaction in a simulated environment where steam is used to influence the evaporation and movement of TCE within a sand layer. The presence of steam affects the energy absorption and flow dynamics, which in turn impacts the rate of TCE removal and its accumulation at the interface of different sand layers. The study highlights how steam can modulate the behavior of TCE in a subsurface environment, particularly in terms of its evaporation and downward movement."
