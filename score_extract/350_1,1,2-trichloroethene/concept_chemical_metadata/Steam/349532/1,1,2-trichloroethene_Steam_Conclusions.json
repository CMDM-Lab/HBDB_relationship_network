    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and steam are related through the investigation of TCE removal processes influenced by water saturation levels. The study indicates that higher water saturation affects TCE evaporation and accumulation at the steam front, ultimately impacting the efficiency of TCE removal. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the physical processes rather than a direct chemical interaction between TCE and steam."
