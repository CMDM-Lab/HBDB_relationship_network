    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is classified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) alongside aromatic hydrocarbons, which include compounds like benzene and toluene. Both categories are discussed in relation to their boiling points and environmental impact, indicating that while 1,1,2-trichloroethene is not an aromatic hydrocarbon itself, it is grouped with them under the broader classification of VOCs that affect air quality. The relationship is primarily categorical rather than functional or interactive."
