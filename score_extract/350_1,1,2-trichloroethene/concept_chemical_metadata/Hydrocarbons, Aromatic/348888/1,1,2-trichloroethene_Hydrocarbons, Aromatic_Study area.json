    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a chlorinated solvent of concern in groundwater quality, while aromatic hydrocarbons are mentioned as having limited occurrence in comparison. The focus is primarily on TCE and other chlorinated VOCs, indicating that while both terms relate to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their significance and prevalence in the studied environment differ, with TCE being more prominent than aromatic hydrocarbons."
