    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to the deactivation of a catalyst, where changes in the absorption profile suggest interactions with hydroxyl and silanol groups over time. The text indicates that TCE may lead to a non-selective elimination of both bridging hydroxyl and silanol, implying a chemical relationship where TCE affects the stability and presence of these functional groups in the catalyst system. However, the specifics of the interaction are not deeply explored."
