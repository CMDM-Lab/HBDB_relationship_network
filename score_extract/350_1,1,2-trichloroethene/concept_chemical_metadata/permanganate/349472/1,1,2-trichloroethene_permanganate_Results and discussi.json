    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being oxidized using potassium permanganate, with the study investigating how acidic conditions affect the reactivity of permanganate during this process. The findings suggest that the acidic environment decreases the oxidation rate of TCE by permanganate, indicating a significant interaction between the two substances in the context of chemical reactivity and environmental remediation."
