    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is treated using permanganate as an oxidant during in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation strategies. Permanganate effectively oxidizes TCE to carbon dioxide and other byproducts, demonstrating its utility in remediating TCE contamination in subsurface environments. The relationship is significant, as permanganate is highlighted as the most commonly used oxidant for TCE treatment, showcasing a direct and critical interaction in environmental remediation efforts."
