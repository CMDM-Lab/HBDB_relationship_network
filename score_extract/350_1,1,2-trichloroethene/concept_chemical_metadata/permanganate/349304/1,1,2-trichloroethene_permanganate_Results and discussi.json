    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being treated with permanganate in an experiment aimed at remediation. The high concentrations of TCE indicate incomplete oxidation, suggesting that permanganate's role as an oxidizing agent is critical in the treatment process. However, the results show that TCE vapors persisted even after permanganate injection, indicating that the oxidation process was not fully effective, and TCE remained in the treatment zone throughout the experiment."
