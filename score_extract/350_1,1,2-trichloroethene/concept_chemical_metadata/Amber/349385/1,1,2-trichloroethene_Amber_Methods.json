    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed for carbon isotope composition using samples collected in 40-mL amber vials. The amber vials are used to preserve the samples for accurate analysis of TCE and its isotopic values. However, there is no discussion of a direct chemical or functional relationship between TCE and amber beyond the use of amber vials for sample collection."
