    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is identified as a chlorinated volatile organic compound (VOC) that is part of a broader category of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The discussion focuses on the degradation of chlorinated VOCs, including 1,1,2-trichloroethene, through UV photooxidation processes. While the relationship is acknowledged, the context does not delve into specific interactions or implications between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and other chlorinated hydrocarbons beyond their classification."
