    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a sorbate used in equilibrium sorption isotherm studies, which can be conducted at various temperatures, including those achievable with liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is utilized to create conditions for measuring vapor phase equilibrium isotherms of TCE, indicating its role in facilitating the experimental setup rather than a direct chemical interaction or biological relevance."
