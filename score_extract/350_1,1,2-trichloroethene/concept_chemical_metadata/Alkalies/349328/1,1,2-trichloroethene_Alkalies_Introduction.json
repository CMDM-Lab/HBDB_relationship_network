    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a common chlorinated solvent associated with chlor-alkali production facilities, while alkalies refer to the chemical compounds used in the chlor-alkali process. However, there is no direct discussion of their interaction or specific relationship beyond their association with the chlor-alkali industry. The focus is more on the environmental impact of TCE rather than its chemical relationship with alkalies."
