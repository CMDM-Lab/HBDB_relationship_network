    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its reactivity and effects on catalyst deactivation, while hydroxyl groups are mentioned as surface features of zeolites that influence catalytic activity. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship established between TCE and hydroxyl groups, as the discussion focuses more on the properties of TCE and the characteristics of hydroxyl groups separately."
