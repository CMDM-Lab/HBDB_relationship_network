    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using compound-specific carbon stable isotope analysis to assess its degradation in a downgradient area. The Î´13C values of TCE are measured to determine the extent of reductive dechlorination, indicating that the isotopic composition can reflect the degradation processes of TCE in the environment. The relationship is significant as the stable isotope analysis provides insights into the biogeochemical behavior of TCE."
