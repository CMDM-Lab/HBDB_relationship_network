    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is evaluated for its removal from contaminated water using clay as an absorbent. The study investigates two methods: one where TCE is degraded in the aqueous phase by G4 while in contact with clay, and another where TCE is extracted from clay using a solvent. The relationship highlights the role of clay in the remediation process of TCE contamination, although the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored."
