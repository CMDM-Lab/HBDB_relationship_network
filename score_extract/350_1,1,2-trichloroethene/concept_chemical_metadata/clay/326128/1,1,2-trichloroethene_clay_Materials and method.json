    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and clay are related through an experimental setup investigating the effect of PM-100 clay on the degradation of TCE. The study examines how the adsorption of TCE to the clay influences the TCE-degrading ability of a microbial culture. The relationship is focused on the interaction between TCE and the clay in the context of environmental degradation processes."
