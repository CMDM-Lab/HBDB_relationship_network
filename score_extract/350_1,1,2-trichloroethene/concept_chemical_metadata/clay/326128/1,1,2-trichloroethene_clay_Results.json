    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is evaluated for its degradation by a microbial strain (G4) in the presence of PM-100 clay. The study indicates that the clay significantly influences TCE utilization by G4, enhancing its degradation efficiency. However, the specific mechanisms by which clay affects TCE degradation are not detailed, suggesting a supportive role rather than a direct chemical interaction."
