    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to PM-100 clay, which is used as an absorbent for TCE. The study indicates that the presence of PM-100 clay affects the degradation and desorption rates of TCE, suggesting a significant interaction where the clay serves as a medium for TCE removal from contaminated environments. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the physical interaction rather than a chemical or biological one."
