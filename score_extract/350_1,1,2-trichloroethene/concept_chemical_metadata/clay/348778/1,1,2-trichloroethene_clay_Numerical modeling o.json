    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed as a contaminant that can persist in groundwater due to the presence of clay layers. The simulation indicates that clay layers can hinder the movement of TCE, allowing it to remain at measurable concentrations in the aquifer for extended periods after source removal. The relationship highlights the role of clay in influencing the transport and degradation of TCE in groundwater systems."
