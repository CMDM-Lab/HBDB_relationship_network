    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant present in a sand aquifer, where its distribution is influenced by the presence of clay layers. The clay acts as a barrier, separating the aquifer into upper and lower zones, which affects the migration and natural attenuation of the TCE plume. However, there is no direct interaction or chemical relationship discussed between TCE and clay beyond their spatial association in the aquifer system."
