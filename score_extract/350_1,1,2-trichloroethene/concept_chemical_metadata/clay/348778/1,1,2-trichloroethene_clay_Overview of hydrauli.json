    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its mass storage in clay layers within an aquifer. The clay acts as a medium for the sorption of TCE, which can be released back into the groundwater during remediation efforts. The relationship highlights the role of clay in influencing the behavior and concentration of TCE in the environment, particularly during back-diffusion processes as groundwater conditions change."
