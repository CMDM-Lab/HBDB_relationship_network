    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant in aquifers, while clay is discussed in relation to its role as a low permeability aquitard that can affect the diffusion and release of contaminants. The studies referenced highlight the importance of understanding how clayey layers can influence the behavior of TCE in groundwater systems, particularly in terms of back diffusion and remediation efforts. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the physical properties of clay affecting contaminant behavior rather than a direct chemical interaction."
