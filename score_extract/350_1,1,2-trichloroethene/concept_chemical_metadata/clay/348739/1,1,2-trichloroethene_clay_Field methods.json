    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its contamination of groundwater, which is confined by a low permeability clay layer. The clay acts as a barrier that limits the movement of TCE within the aquifer system, indicating a physical relationship where the clay influences the distribution and potential remediation of TCE in the groundwater. However, there is no detailed discussion of chemical interactions between TCE and clay."
