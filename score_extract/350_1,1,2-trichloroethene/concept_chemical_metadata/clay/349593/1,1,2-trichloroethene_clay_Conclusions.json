    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and clay are related through the discussion of environmental engineering strategies to mitigate TCE contamination in indoor air. The insertion of a clay layer with recharge is highlighted as an effective method to create an impervious barrier that prevents TCE from migrating through soil gas into indoor spaces. This demonstrates a significant interaction where clay serves as a protective measure against TCE contamination."
