    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport through a clay layer. The clay acts as a barrier, preventing TCE from impacting indoor air quality by limiting its movement primarily to diffusive flux in the aqueous phase. The effectiveness of the clay layer in reducing TCE concentrations is highlighted, particularly when fully water saturated, indicating a significant protective role against TCE contamination in residential areas."
