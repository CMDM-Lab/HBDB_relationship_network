    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as target volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a study evaluating the reactivity of potassium permanganate in permeable reactive barriers. However, the relationship between TCE and toluene is not explicitly discussed, and they are treated as separate contaminants undergoing similar experimental conditions without direct interaction or comparison between them."
