    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be oxidized using potassium permanganate in a remediation process. The study highlights their chemical reactions with the oxidant, indicating that both compounds are targeted for degradation in groundwater remediation efforts. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their simultaneous treatment rather than a direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds."
