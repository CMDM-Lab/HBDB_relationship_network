    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are discussed in relation to their oxidation reactions with potassium permanganate. The study indicates that the pH levels during the experiments influenced the oxidation rates of TCE and toluene differently. While both compounds are involved in the same experimental setup, their specific interactions or comparative effects are not elaborated upon, indicating a more general relationship based on their chemical behavior in the presence of an oxidizing agent."
