    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be oxidized by a permeable reactive barrier. The study provides estimates of the longevity of this barrier in oxidizing TCE and toluene vapors, indicating a shared relevance in the context of environmental remediation. However, the relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same treatment scenario without detailed interaction or comparison between the two compounds."
