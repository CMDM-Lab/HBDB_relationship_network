    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are discussed in relation to their oxidation rates and the influence of environmental factors such as pH on their degradation. The simulation results indicate that while TCE has a larger oxidation rate constant compared to ethanol and toluene, the oxidation of both TCE and toluene is significantly affected by changes in pH during their oxidation processes. This suggests a comparative relationship in their behavior under similar conditions, particularly in the context of environmental remediation."
