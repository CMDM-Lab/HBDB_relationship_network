    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene are discussed in relation to their roles as substrates in aerobic cometabolism for the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs). Toluene, as an aromatic substrate, is noted for its greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes compared to other substrates, indicating a significant interaction in the context of bioremediation processes. However, the specific relationship between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene is not deeply explored beyond their roles in the degradation process."
