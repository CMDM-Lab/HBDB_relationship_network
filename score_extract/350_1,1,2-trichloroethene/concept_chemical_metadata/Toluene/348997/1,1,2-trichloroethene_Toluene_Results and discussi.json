    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) undergoing photodegradation processes. The study compares their degradation rates under photolysis and photocatalysis, indicating that toluene has a slower degradation rate than 1,1,2-trichloroethene. However, the relationship is primarily focused on their degradation kinetics rather than any direct interaction or functional relationship between the two compounds."
