    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) investigated for their vapor dissolution and diffusion into water. The study aims to understand the kinetics of VOC vapor dissolution, specifically focusing on TCE and toluene, as they are used in the same experimental setup to evaluate their mass transfer across air-water interfaces. However, the relationship is primarily based on their co-investigation rather than a direct interaction or comparison between the two compounds."
