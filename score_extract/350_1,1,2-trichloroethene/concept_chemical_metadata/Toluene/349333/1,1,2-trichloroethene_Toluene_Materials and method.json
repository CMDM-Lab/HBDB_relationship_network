    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being studied for their evaporation and dissolution rate constants in a controlled experimental setup. The experiments aim to understand the mass transfer dynamics of these VOCs in water, indicating a comparative analysis of their behavior in the same environmental conditions. However, there is no direct interaction or specific relationship between TCE and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same experimental framework."
