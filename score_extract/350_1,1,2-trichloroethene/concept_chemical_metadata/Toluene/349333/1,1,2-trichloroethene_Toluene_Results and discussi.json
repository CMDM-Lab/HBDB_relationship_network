    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed for their concentration values in a water reservoir simulation. The study focuses on the molecular diffusion coefficients of these VOCs in water, indicating a shared interest in their behavior in environmental contexts. However, there is no direct interaction or functional relationship discussed between TCE and toluene beyond their inclusion in the same analysis framework."
