    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose dissolution in water is influenced by salinity. The study indicates that the solubility of both compounds decreases in seawater compared to deionized water, suggesting a shared behavior in terms of mass transfer and solubility in aquatic environments. However, the specific interactions or comparative effects between TCE and toluene are not elaborated upon beyond their solubility characteristics."
