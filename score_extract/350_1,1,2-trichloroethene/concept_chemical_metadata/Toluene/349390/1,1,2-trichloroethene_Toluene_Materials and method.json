    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in transport experiments. The study focuses on measuring the concentrations of these compounds in stock solutions and their behavior in reactive and control columns. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the experiments, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship."
