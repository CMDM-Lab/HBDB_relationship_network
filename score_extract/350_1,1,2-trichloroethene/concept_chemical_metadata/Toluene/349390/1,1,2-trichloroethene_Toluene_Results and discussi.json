    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) whose oxidation rates were modeled in relation to potassium permanganate. The study highlights the controlling effect of pH on the oxidation rates of both compounds, indicating a shared chemical behavior in the experimental setup. However, the specific interactions or comparative significance between TCE and toluene are not deeply explored beyond their inclusion in the modeling of oxidation rates."
