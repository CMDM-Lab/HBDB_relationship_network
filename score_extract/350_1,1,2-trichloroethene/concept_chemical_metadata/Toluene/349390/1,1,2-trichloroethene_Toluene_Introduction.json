    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be oxidized by potassium permanganate in permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) to mitigate contamination. However, the relationship is primarily based on their inclusion in the same chemical reactions for oxidation, without any detailed discussion of their specific interactions or comparative significance in the context of the study."
