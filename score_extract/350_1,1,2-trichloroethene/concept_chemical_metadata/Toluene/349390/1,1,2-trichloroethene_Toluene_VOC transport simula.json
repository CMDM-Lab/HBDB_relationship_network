    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in oxidation experiments with potassium permanganate. The study indicates that the oxidation rates of these compounds are influenced by pH levels, with specific equations provided for TCE. However, the relationship between TCE and toluene is not directly explored beyond their shared involvement in the oxidation process, suggesting a general connection rather than a detailed interaction."
