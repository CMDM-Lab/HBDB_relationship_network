    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) involved in experiments assessing their transport and oxidation in a reactive transport model. The study focuses on the efficiency of a thicker HPRB in oxidizing these VOCs, indicating a shared relevance in the context of environmental chemistry and remediation processes. However, the specific interactions or comparative analysis between TCE and toluene are not detailed, limiting the depth of their relationship."
