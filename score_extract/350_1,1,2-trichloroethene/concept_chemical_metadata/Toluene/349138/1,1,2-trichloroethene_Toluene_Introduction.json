    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are related through the process of biodegradation. TCE can be cometabolically biodegraded by certain aerobic bacteria that utilize toluene as a carbon source. This indicates that toluene can play a role in the microbial degradation pathways of TCE, highlighting a functional relationship between the two compounds in environmental bioremediation processes."
