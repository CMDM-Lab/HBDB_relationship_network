    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are related through their roles in microbial degradation processes. Toluene is identified as an inducer of TCE degradation, specifically through the action of toluene o-monooxygenase (TOM), which initiates the mineralization of TCE. This indicates a significant biochemical interaction where toluene enhances the microbial ability to degrade TCE, highlighting its importance in bioremediation efforts."
