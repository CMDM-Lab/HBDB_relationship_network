    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both organic compounds evaluated in relation to the effects of a Pd/Fe coating on partition and diffusion coefficients through geomembranes. While TCE is rapidly degraded by the coating, toluene serves as a comparative control since it is not degraded under the same conditions. The study aims to indirectly assess the impact of the coating on TCE by using toluene to establish baseline diffusion and partition coefficients, highlighting their roles in the experimental design without a direct interaction between the two compounds."
