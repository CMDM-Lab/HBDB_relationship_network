    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene are both mentioned in relation to a study on diffusion through a geomembrane. The focus is on the mass transfer of TCE, with toluene's diffusion coefficient being determined as part of the experimental setup. However, there is no direct interaction or comparative analysis between TCE and toluene, as they are treated separately in the context of diffusion studies."
