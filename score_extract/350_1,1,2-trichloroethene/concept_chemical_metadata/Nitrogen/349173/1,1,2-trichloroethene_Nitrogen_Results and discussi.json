    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation rates in different environments, specifically in air and nitrogen. The study indicates that moisture enhances the degradation of TCE, with a more pronounced effect observed in air compared to nitrogen. However, the relationship between TCE and nitrogen is primarily about the environmental conditions affecting TCE degradation rather than a direct interaction or chemical relationship between the two substances."
