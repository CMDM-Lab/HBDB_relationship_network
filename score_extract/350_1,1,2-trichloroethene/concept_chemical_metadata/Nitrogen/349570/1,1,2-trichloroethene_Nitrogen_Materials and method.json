    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as part of a gas mixture that includes nitrogen as a balance gas. The nitrogen serves to dilute the concentration of TCE and other gases in the high-pressure gas cylinder. However, there is no discussion of any chemical interaction or biological relevance between TCE and nitrogen beyond their coexistence in the gas mixture."
