    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound that transgenic plants can metabolize effectively, while petroleum is referenced as a source of benzene, a carcinogenic compound associated with petroleum pollution. Both substances are part of a broader discussion on environmental pollutants, but their direct relationship is not explicitly detailed. The focus is on the plants' ability to remediate TCE and other pollutants, with petroleum being a contextually relevant source of one of the compounds studied."
