    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and methane are related through the process of aerobic cometabolism, where methane-utilizing microbial communities can degrade chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) like TCE. The studies referenced indicate that methane can serve as a primary substrate for the aerobic degradation of TCE, suggesting a significant interaction in the biodegradation process of these contaminants in groundwater environments."
