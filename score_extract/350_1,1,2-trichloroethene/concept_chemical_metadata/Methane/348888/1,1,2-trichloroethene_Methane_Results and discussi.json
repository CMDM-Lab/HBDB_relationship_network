    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a parent compound that undergoes anaerobic dechlorination to form degradation products like cDCE, particularly under methanogenic conditions. While methane is not directly discussed as a product of TCE degradation, its presence is implied as a condition that facilitates the dechlorination process. However, the relationship between TCE and methane is not explicitly detailed, indicating a more indirect connection."
