    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and methane are related through the metabolic activities of specific bacteria. Methanotrophs, which utilize methane as their carbon and energy source, are involved in the cometabolic degradation of TCE. The presence of methanotrophic bacteria, such as Methylotenera and Methylobacter, suggests a synergistic relationship where methane production by methanogens supports the degradation of TCE by these bacteria, particularly under anaerobic conditions."
