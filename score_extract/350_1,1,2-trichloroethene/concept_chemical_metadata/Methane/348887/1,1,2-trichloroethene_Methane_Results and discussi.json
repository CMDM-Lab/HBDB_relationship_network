    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and methane are both mentioned in relation to anaerobic conditions affecting the transformation of TCE. The presence of methane indicates methanogenic conditions that may facilitate the reductive dechlorination of TCE to less harmful compounds like cis-DCE and VC. However, the specific interaction between TCE and methane is not elaborated upon, suggesting a general association rather than a direct relationship."
