    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and methane are mentioned in relation to the environmental conditions at a waste site. Methane concentrations are significantly higher than those of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including TCE. The text suggests that some methane may arise from the dechlorination of chlorinated solvents like TCE, although this is complicated by the presence of methane from biological waste. The anaerobic conditions at the site are conducive to the reductive dechlorination of TCE, potentially leading to the formation of less chlorinated compounds, including methane."
