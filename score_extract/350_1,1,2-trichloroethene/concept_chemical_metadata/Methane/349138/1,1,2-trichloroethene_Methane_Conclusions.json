    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and methane are related through the processes of biodegradation occurring at the WAG5 site. The presence of methanotrophs indicates that methane may facilitate the aerobic biodegradation of TCE via cometabolism. This suggests a significant interaction where methane enhances the breakdown of TCE, particularly in oxygenated zones, contributing to the natural attenuation of this chlorinated solvent."
