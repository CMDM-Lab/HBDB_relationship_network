    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its anaerobic biodegradation pathways, which involve various microorganisms, including those that utilize methane as a carbon source. Methane is mentioned as a potential substrate for certain aerobic bacteria that can cometabolically degrade TCE. This indicates a connection where methane serves as a carbon source for bacteria that can also facilitate the breakdown of TCE, although the specifics of their interaction are not deeply explored."
