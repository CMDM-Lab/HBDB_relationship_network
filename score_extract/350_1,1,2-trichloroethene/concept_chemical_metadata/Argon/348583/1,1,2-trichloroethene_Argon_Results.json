    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be destroyed using a plasma torch system, which utilizes argon as a working gas. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the operational aspects of the plasma system rather than a direct chemical interaction between the two substances. Argon serves as a medium for the plasma process, but no specific biochemical or physiological relevance is discussed."
