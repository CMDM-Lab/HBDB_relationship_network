    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (C2HCl3) is evaluated for its destruction rate in a plasma system, where argon is used as one of the gases to create the plasma. The study highlights the effectiveness of argon plasma in destroying volatile organic compounds like trichloroethene, achieving destruction rates greater than 99%. The relationship is significant as argon is a key component in the plasma process that facilitates the breakdown of the chemical, indicating its role in the treatment of hazardous substances."
