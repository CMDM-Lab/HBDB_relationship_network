    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and butadiene are both mentioned in relation to their diffusion and mass transfer properties through geomembranes. However, the text primarily focuses on TCE's behavior in a confined double compartment apparatus and does not provide a direct comparison or interaction between TCE and butadiene. Their mention is more about their roles in the study rather than a specific relationship."
