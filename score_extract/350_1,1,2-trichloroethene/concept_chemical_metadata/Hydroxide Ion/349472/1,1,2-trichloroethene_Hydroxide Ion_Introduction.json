    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a chemical oxidation process using potassium permanganate, which generates hydroxide ions (OHâˆ’) as a byproduct. The oxidation reactions indicate that TCE is being transformed into other products, with hydroxide ions being produced in the process. This suggests a direct chemical relationship where the oxidation of TCE contributes to the formation of hydroxide ions, highlighting their interconnected roles in the remediation of VOCs in groundwater."
