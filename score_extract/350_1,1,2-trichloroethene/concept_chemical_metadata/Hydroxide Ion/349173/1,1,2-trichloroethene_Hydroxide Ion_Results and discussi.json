    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in photodegradation reactions where hydroxide ions (OH) play a crucial role as reactive species. The presence of moisture enhances the generation of hydroxyl radicals, which significantly increases the degradation rate of TCE in air. The reactions indicate that hydroxyl radicals can effectively react with TCE, suggesting a direct and significant relationship between TCE and hydroxide ions in the context of environmental degradation processes."
