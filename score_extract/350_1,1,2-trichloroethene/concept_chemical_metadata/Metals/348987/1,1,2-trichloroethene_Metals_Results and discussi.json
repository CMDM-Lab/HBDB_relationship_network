    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to the reduction behavior of metal species in a catalyst system. The aging of the catalyst with TCE appears to affect the reducibility of metals like chromium and copper, suggesting that TCE influences the chemical state of these metals. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the catalytic process rather than a direct interaction between TCE and metals themselves."
