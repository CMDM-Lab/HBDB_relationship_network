    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a volatile organic compound (VOC) of concern in groundwater contamination, particularly linked to industrial applications involving metal cleaning. While metals such as barium are mentioned in relation to groundwater quality, there is no direct discussion of how TCE interacts with or affects metal concentrations. The relationship is more about their co-occurrence in contaminated environments rather than a specific interaction."
