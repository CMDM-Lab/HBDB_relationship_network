    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant associated with a metal fabricating facility, where its release has led to a subsurface plume. However, the relationship between TCE and metals is not explicitly discussed, and while metals may be present due to the facility's operations, no direct interaction or impact between TCE and metals is detailed in the study. The focus is primarily on the behavior of TCE in the aquifer rather than its relationship with metals."
