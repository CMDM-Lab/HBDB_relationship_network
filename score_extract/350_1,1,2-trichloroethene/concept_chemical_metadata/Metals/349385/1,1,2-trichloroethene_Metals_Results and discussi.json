    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to the microbial processes involved in its dechlorination, particularly by the genus Geobacter, which also functions as a metal-reducing bacterium. While metals are not directly mentioned as a focus, the role of Geobacter in metal reduction suggests a potential indirect relationship where the presence of metals may influence the dechlorination process of TCE. However, the context does not provide explicit details on how metals interact with TCE or the dehalogenation process."
