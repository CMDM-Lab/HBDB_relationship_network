    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its biodegradation pathways, which involve various microorganisms that utilize carbon sources for metabolism. While TCE itself is a chlorinated compound, the mention of carbon refers to the carbon sources that some aerobic bacteria use to cometabolically degrade TCE. The relationship is indirect, as carbon is a fundamental element in the metabolic processes of the bacteria involved in TCE degradation, but no specific interaction between TCE and carbon is detailed."
