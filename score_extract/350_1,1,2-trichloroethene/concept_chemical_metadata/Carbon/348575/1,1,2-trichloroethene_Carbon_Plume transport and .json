    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is discussed in relation to aerobic cometabolism, which involves the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) to carbon dioxide (CO2) and other products. Carbon is indirectly referenced as a product of this degradation process, highlighting its role in the overall metabolic pathway. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed, focusing more on the degradation process rather than a direct interaction between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon itself."
