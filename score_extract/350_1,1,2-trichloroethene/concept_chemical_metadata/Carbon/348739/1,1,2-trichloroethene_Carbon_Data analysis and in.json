    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its environmental behavior in groundwater, particularly its mass and concentration over time. Carbon is indirectly referenced through the mention of soil organic carbon content and its role in estimating TCE sorption. However, there is no direct relationship or interaction between TCE and carbon beyond its role in the sorption process, which is not elaborated upon in detail."
