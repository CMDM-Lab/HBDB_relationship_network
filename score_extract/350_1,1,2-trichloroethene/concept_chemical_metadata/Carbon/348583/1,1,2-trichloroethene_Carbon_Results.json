    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is indirectly related to carbon through the byproducts formed during its degradation in a plasma reactor. The analysis indicates that the breakdown of chlorinated compounds leads to the production of CO2, which represents a loss of atomic carbon. The output concentration of CO2 correlates with the concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) introduced, suggesting a relationship between the degradation of 1,1,2-trichloroethene and carbon release in the form of CO2."
