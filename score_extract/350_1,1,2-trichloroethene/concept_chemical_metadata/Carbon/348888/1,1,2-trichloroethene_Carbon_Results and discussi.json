    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its sorption behavior in groundwater systems, particularly influenced by the fraction of organic carbon (f oc) in sediments. The organic carbon content affects the retardation of TCE in the environment, indicating a relationship where carbon plays a crucial role in the sorption and transport of TCE in aquifers. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the physical and chemical interactions rather than a direct biological or metabolic connection."
