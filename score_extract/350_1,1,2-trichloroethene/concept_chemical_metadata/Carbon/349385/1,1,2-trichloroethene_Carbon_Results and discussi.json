    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by specific bacteria, including methanotrophs that utilize methane as a carbon source. The presence of carbon, specifically in the form of methane, is crucial for the metabolic processes of these bacteria, which are involved in the cometabolic degradation of TCE. Thus, carbon serves as an essential energy source for the microbial communities that facilitate the breakdown of TCE in the environment."
