    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed in relation to its interaction with organic carbon in soil samples. The study measures the fraction of organic carbon (f oc) in clay layers, which is crucial for understanding TCE's sorption behavior and its retardation factor in the environment. While TCE is a specific chemical compound, carbon is a general element that plays a significant role in the sorption processes affecting TCE's mobility in contaminated sites."
