    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a compound that can be biodegraded by various microorganisms, including those that utilize phenols as a carbon source. The relationship indicates that phenols can play a role in the cometabolic biodegradation of TCE by aerobic bacteria, suggesting a potential interaction in the degradation pathways of chlorinated solvents. However, the specifics of how phenols enhance or affect TCE degradation are not elaborated upon in detail."
