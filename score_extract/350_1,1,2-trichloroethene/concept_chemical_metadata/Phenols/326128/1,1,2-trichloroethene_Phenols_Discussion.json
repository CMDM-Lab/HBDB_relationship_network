    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and phenols are related through their degradation processes in a bioreactor. The study indicates that the presence of phenol influences the degradation rate of TCE, with a specific TCE-to-phenol ratio observed. The inoculum pre-induced with phenol showed enhanced capability to degrade TCE, suggesting a synergistic relationship where phenol aids in the effective breakdown of TCE in the reactor setup."
