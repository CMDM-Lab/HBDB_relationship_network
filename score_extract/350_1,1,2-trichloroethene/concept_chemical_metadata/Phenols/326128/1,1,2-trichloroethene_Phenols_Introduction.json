    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a compound whose degradation is influenced by the presence of phenols in the growth medium of the G4 microbial strain. The study indicates that phenol, along with other compounds like toluene and cresols, can induce the TCE-degradative ability of G4, suggesting a direct relationship where phenols enhance the microbial degradation of TCE. This highlights the role of phenols as a significant factor in the mineralization process of TCE."
