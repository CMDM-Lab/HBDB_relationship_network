    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and phenols are related through their interaction in a degradation process involving the G4 treatment. The study indicates that phenol concentrations significantly affect the degradation of TCE, with lower phenol concentrations facilitating TCE reduction, while higher concentrations (1200ppm) inhibit this process. This suggests a competitive or inhibitory relationship between TCE and phenols during the degradation process."
