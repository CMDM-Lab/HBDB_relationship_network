    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and phenols are related through the study of TCE degradation by the G4 culture, which requires phenol to induce the necessary degrading enzymes. The experiment investigates how varying initial concentrations of phenol affect the ability of G4 to degrade TCE, indicating a direct functional relationship where phenols play a crucial role in enhancing TCE degradation."
