    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and phenols are mentioned in relation to aerobic cometabolism, where aromatic substrates like phenols are noted for their greater removal efficiency of chlorinated ethenes, including 1,1,2-trichloroethene. This suggests a potential interaction where phenols may enhance the degradation of chlorinated compounds through cometabolic processes, although specific details on their direct relationship are limited."
