    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a dechlorination process facilitated by a palladium/iron reactive geomembrane (Pd/Fe RGM). The palladium acts as a catalyst in the reduction of TCE, which is adsorbed onto the Pd/Fe surface. The reactions described indicate a direct functional relationship where palladium enhances the dechlorination of TCE, highlighting its role in environmental remediation applications."
