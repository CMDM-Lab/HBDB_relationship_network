    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to palladium (Pd) as part of a reactive granular material (Pd/Fe RGM) used for the mitigation of chlorinated volatile organic contaminants in groundwater. The effectiveness of palladium as a catalyst for TCE degradation is discussed, particularly in the context of aging effects on the reactivity of the Pd/Fe RGM. The study highlights that palladium's catalytic properties are crucial for the reactivity towards TCE, and aging can diminish this reactivity, impacting the overall performance of the remediation system."
