    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a compound undergoing dechlorination facilitated by a palladium/iron (Pd/Fe) reactive geomembrane. However, the term 'Elements' is too broad and does not specifically relate to TCE or its chemical interactions. The context primarily focuses on the reactions involving Pd and Fe rather than a direct relationship with elemental properties or classifications."
