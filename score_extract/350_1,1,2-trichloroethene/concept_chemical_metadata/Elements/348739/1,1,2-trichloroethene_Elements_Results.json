    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to groundwater and hydrogeologic characterization, but there is no direct mention of 'Elements' as a specific term. The focus is on TCE concentrations and groundwater fluxes, with elements likely referring to various constituents analyzed in the study. However, the relationship between TCE and 'Elements' is not explicitly defined or explored."
