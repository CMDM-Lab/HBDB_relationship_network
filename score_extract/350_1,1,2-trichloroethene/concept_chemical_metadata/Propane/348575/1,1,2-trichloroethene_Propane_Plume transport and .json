    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and propane are related through the process of aerobic cometabolism, where propane serves as a gaseous co-metabolic substrate that enhances the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) like 1,1,2-trichloroethene. The literature suggests that propane is effective in treating chlorinated methanes and ethanes, indicating a functional relationship in bioremediation processes involving these compounds. However, the specific interaction between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and propane is not deeply explored, focusing instead on broader degradation mechanisms."
