    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed for its degradation, with chloride ion concentration being a measured outcome of this process. The study indicates that while TCE degradation was assessed, the increase in chloride ion concentration did not show a significant difference between treatments with the HDM and controls. This suggests a potential relationship where TCE degradation could lead to chloride ion production, but the lack of significant results indicates that the relationship is not strongly established in this specific study."
