    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to ensure the stability of isotope measurements during sample analysis. The relationship between TCE and isotopes is primarily methodological, focusing on the use of isotopes to accurately measure and analyze the compound's presence in samples. However, there is no direct discussion of the chemical properties or biological implications of TCE in relation to isotopes."
