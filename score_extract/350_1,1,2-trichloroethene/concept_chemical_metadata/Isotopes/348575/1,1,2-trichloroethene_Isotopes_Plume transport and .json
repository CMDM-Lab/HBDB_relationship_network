    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed through isotopic evaluation, specifically Î´13C and 14C isotopes, to study its degradation pathways in the environment. The isotopic data helps differentiate between various degradation processes of TCE and its byproducts, indicating a significant relationship between TCE and isotopes in understanding its biodegradation mechanisms. However, the context does not provide a direct interaction between TCE and isotopes beyond their analytical use in the study."
