    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation processes, particularly through reductive dechlorination to vinyl chloride (VC). The mention of isotopes pertains to compound-specific isotope analysis, which is used to evaluate the degradation of TCE and its environmental impact. However, the relationship between TCE and isotopes is indirect, as isotopes are a method of analysis rather than a direct interaction with TCE itself."
