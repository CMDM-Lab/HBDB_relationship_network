    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed through the lens of isotopic enrichment, specifically δ13CTCE values, to track its biodegradation in groundwater. The study observes a correlation between declining TCE concentrations and increasing δ13CTCE values, indicating that isotopic analysis can provide insights into the transformation of TCE into its byproducts, such as cis-DCE and VC, during biodegradation processes."
