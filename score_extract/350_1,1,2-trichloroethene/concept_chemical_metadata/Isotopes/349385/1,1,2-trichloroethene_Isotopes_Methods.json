    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using carbon isotope analysis, specifically focusing on the Î´13C values. The relationship between TCE and isotopes is established through the measurement of the carbon isotope ratios, which are essential for understanding the environmental behavior and source identification of TCE. However, the context does not delve into any biological or chemical interactions beyond the analytical methodology."
