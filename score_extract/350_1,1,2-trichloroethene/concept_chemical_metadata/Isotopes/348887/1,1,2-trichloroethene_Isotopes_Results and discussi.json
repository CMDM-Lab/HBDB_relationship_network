    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed for its carbon isotope ratios (Î´13C values) to assess its degradation processes in groundwater. The isotopic analysis provides insights into the environmental behavior of TCE, indicating small differences in isotope enrichment factors during degradation. This relationship highlights the use of isotopes as a tool for understanding the fate of TCE in the environment."
