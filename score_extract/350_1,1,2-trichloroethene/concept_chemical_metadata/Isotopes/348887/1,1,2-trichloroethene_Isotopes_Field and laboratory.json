    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed alongside isotopes to study its distribution and degradation in groundwater samples. The isotope analyses, particularly carbon isotopes, are used to understand the composition and behavior of TCE in the environment. However, the relationship is primarily methodological, focusing on the use of isotopes to track TCE rather than a direct interaction between the two terms."
