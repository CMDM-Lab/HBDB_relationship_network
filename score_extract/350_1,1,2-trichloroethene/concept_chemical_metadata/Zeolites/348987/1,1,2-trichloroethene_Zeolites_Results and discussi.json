    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its reactivity and deactivation effects on combustion catalysts, specifically in the presence of zeolites. The text highlights how TCE's lower reactivity compared to other chlorinated compounds affects catalyst performance over time. However, the relationship between TCE and zeolites is not deeply explored, focusing more on the catalyst's behavior rather than a direct interaction between the two substances."
