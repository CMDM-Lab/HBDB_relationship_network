    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its biodegradation processes occurring in fractured shale bedrock. The study highlights the natural attenuation of TCE through both anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation mechanisms, suggesting that shale formations may play a significant role in the environmental degradation of TCE. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the geological context rather than a direct interaction between TCE and shale itself."
