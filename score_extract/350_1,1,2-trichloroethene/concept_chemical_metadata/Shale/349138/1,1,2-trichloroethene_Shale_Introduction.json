    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being investigated for its potential biodegradation in a fractured shale aquifer at the Oak Ridge Reservation. The study aims to assess the conditions under which TCE can degrade, linking its presence to the geological characteristics of the shale environment. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the environmental context rather than a direct interaction between TCE and shale itself."
