    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a chlorinated volatile organic compound (VOC) used in industrial applications, while chlorides are implied as a related chemical category due to the presence of chlorine in both. However, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between 1,1,2-trichloroethene and chlorides, focusing instead on the broader implications of chlorinated VOCs on health and environmental concerns."
