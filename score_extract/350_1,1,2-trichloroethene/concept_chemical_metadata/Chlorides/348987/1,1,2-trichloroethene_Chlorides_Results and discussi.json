    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its interactions with chlorine, particularly in the context of catalyst deactivation. The presence of chlorine, as indicated by the formation of metal chlorides, is crucial in understanding the catalyst's performance and stability during reactions involving TCE. The text highlights how chlorine atoms interact with metallic species, affecting the catalyst's activity, but does not provide a direct functional relationship between TCE and chlorides beyond this interaction."
