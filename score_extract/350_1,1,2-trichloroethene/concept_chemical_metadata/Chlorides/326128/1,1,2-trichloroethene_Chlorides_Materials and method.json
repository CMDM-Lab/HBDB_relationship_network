    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is linked to the production of chlorides during its degradation process. The experiment demonstrates that the addition of TCE in a methanol solution leads to an increase in chloride content, indicating that chlorides are a byproduct of TCE degradation. This relationship highlights the chemical transformation of TCE and its impact on chloride levels in the system."
