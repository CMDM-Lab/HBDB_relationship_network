    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and chlorides are related through the analysis of chloride ion concentrations to confirm TCE degradation by the microbial strain G4. The study indicates that chloride analyses were performed to assess the utilization of TCE, but no significant differences in chloride levels were observed between treatments with and without hexadecane, suggesting that hexadecane did not affect TCE degradation significantly."
