    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and chlorides are mentioned in relation to the conditions affecting reductive dechlorination processes. The presence of chlorides is noted as a potential byproduct of TCE transformation, but the background chloride levels are too low to serve as a reliable indicator of dechlorination. Thus, while both terms are related through the chemical transformation process, their direct relationship is not emphasized or quantitatively supported in the context provided."
