    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed as part of soil gas measurements, while Tenax is used as a porous polymer adsorbent for capturing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like TCE. The Tenax tubes are employed to collect and concentrate TCE from the soil gas for subsequent analysis using gas chromatography. This indicates a direct functional relationship where Tenax serves as a tool for measuring TCE concentrations in environmental samples."
