    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its degradation in a reactor setup, where aluminum foil was used to block light output during experiments. However, there is no direct interaction or chemical relationship established between TCE and aluminum beyond the use of aluminum as a physical barrier in the experimental design. The focus remains on TCE's degradation rather than any specific role of aluminum in its chemical behavior or effects."
