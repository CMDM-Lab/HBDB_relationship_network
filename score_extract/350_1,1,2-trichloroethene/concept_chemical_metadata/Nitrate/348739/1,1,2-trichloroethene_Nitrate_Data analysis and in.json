    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and nitrate are mentioned in relation to the geochemical conditions of a TCE plume. The presence of detectable nitrate concentrations (2â€“8 mg/L) suggests oxidizing conditions, which are not conducive to the reductive dechlorination of TCE. This indicates that while both substances are present in the same environment, their relationship is primarily based on the geochemical context rather than a direct interaction or metabolic relationship."
