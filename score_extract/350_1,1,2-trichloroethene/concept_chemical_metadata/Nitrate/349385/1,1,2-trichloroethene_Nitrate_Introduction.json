    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a common chlorinated solvent found in groundwater contamination, which is often associated with nitrate contamination. The presence of TCE in groundwater can lead to the formation of long contaminant plumes that may affect water quality, including nitrate levels. However, the specific interaction between TCE and nitrate is not detailed, indicating a general association rather than a direct relationship."
