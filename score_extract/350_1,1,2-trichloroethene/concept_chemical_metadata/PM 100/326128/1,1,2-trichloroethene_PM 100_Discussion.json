    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to PM-100 clay, which is used as an absorbent for TCE. The study indicates that the degradation rate of TCE is significantly lower when PM-100 clay is present, suggesting a direct interaction where PM-100 affects the desorption and degradation processes of TCE. The investigation highlights the role of PM-100 in TCE remediation, emphasizing its importance in environmental cleanup efforts."
