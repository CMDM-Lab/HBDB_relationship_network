    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is evaluated for its degradation by a microbial strain (G4) in the presence of PM-100 clay. The study indicates that PM-100 clay significantly affects TCE utilization by G4, enhancing the degradation process. Statistical analyses reveal a notable difference in TCE concentration reduction when treated with PM-100 compared to controls, suggesting a synergistic effect in TCE degradation."
