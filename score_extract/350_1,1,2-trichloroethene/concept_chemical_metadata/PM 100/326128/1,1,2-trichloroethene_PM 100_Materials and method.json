    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being studied for its degradation in the presence of PM-100 clay. The experiment assesses how different concentrations of TCE interact with PM-100 to determine its effect on TCE degradation by a microbial culture (G4). The relationship is focused on the adsorption of TCE to PM-100 and its subsequent degradation, indicating a direct interaction between the two substances in the context of environmental remediation."
