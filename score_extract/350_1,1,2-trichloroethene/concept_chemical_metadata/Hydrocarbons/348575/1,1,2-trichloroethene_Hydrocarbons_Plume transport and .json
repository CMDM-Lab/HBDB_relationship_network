    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned alongside hydrocarbons as part of a study examining the biodegradation and transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the environment. While TCE is a chlorinated solvent, hydrocarbons refer to a broader category of organic compounds. The relationship is indirect, as both are involved in environmental contamination and degradation processes, but no specific interaction or comparison between TCE and hydrocarbons is detailed."
