    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed as a specific chemical that meets the criteria for vapor phase equilibrium sorption isotherms, which are typically evaluated for hydrocarbons. While TCE is a chlorinated solvent and not a hydrocarbon itself, it is included in the study of sorption behaviors relevant to hydrocarbon interactions, indicating a broader context of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their environmental behavior. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond its inclusion in the methodology for evaluating sorption isotherms."
