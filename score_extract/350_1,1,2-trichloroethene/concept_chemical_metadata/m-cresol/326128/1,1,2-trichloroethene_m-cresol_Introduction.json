    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and m-cresol are related through their roles in the degradation process by the G4 microbial strain. The presence of m-cresol, along with other compounds like toluene and o-cresol, was found to induce the TCE-degradative ability of G4. This suggests that m-cresol may enhance the microbial metabolism of TCE, although the specific mechanisms of interaction are not detailed."
