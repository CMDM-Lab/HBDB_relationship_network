    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and sodium permanganate are related through a bioremediation experiment where sodium permanganate is used as an oxidizing agent to treat TCE contamination. The sodium permanganate solution is injected into a treatment column containing TCE, indicating its role in enhancing the degradation of TCE, although the specific mechanisms of interaction are not detailed."
