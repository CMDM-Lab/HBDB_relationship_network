    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and butane are related through the concept of aerobic cometabolism, where butane serves as a gaseous co-metabolic substrate that enhances the degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) like 1,1,2-trichloroethene. The text indicates that butane is preferred for its higher carbon content and solubility, suggesting a significant role in the bioremediation processes involving chlorinated compounds. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the role of butane in the degradation process rather than a direct interaction between the two compounds."
