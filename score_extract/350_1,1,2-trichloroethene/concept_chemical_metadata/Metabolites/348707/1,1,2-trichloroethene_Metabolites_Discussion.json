    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its biotransformation in the liver, where it is metabolized into various potentially toxic metabolites such as chloral, trichloroacetic acid, and trichloroethanol. These metabolites can enter systemic circulation and may have implications for toxicity and carcinogenesis, highlighting the significant relationship between TCE and its metabolites in terms of biological effects and health risks."
