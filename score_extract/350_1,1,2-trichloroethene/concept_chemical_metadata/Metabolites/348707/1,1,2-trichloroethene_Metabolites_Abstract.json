    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its metabolites, which are formed through biotransformation primarily via a CYP450-catalyzed oxidative pathway. The text highlights the significance of these metabolites in modulating the toxicokinetics and potential carcinogenicity of TCE, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and its metabolic products in terms of toxicity and health risks."
