    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is linked to its metabolites, specifically cis-DCE and VC, which are products of its transformation during groundwater contamination. The study highlights the role of microbial communities in the reductive dechlorination process, indicating that TCE undergoes metabolic changes leading to the formation of these metabolites, thus demonstrating a clear biochemical relationship between TCE and its metabolites in the context of environmental degradation."
