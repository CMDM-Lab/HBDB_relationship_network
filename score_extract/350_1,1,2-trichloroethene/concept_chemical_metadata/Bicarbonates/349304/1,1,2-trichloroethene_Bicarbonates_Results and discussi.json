    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is treated through a process that generates CO2, which subsequently converts to bicarbonate in the water column. The study discusses the dissolution of CO2 and its conversion to bicarbonate, indicating a chemical relationship where the oxidation of TCE contributes to bicarbonate formation. However, the details of this conversion and its implications are not extensively explored."
