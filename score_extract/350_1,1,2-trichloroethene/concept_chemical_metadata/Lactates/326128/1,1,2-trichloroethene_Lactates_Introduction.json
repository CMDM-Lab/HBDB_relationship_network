    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to the degradation capabilities of Burkholderia cepacia strain G4, which can mineralize TCE when grown in specific conditions. Lactates are listed among the carbon sources that inhibit TCE degradation by G4. However, there is no direct interaction or significant relationship established between TCE and lactates beyond their mention in the same study."
