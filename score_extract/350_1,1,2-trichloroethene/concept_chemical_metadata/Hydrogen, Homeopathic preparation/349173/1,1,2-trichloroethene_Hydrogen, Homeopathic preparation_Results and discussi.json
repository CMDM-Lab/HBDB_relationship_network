    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes involving hydroxyl radicals, which can be generated from reactions with water (H2O) and light. However, there is no mention of a direct relationship between TCE and hydrogen as a homeopathic preparation. The focus is primarily on the chemical reactions and degradation rates of TCE rather than any medicinal or homeopathic implications of hydrogen."
