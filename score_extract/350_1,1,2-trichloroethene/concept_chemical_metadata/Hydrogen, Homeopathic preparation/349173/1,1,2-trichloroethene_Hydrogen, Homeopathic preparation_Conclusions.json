    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its photodegradation processes, particularly focusing on its reactivity and degradation kinetics under UV light. However, there is no mention of hydrogen or homeopathic preparations in relation to TCE or its degradation. The terms appear unrelated within the provided context."
