    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in experiments assessing the effects of buffering agents on proton production during its treatment. The addition of sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate aims to buffer protons generated in the reactive layer, indicating a relationship where the buffering capacity influences the reactivity of TCE in the experimental setup. However, the specific interactions between TCE and protons are not elaborated upon beyond this buffering context."
