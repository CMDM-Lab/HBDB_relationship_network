    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is linked to protons through its oxidation process, which results in a decrease in pH and the production of protons (H+) as indicated by the stoichiometric reaction equations. The concentration of protons is modeled as a function of the reaction rate and pH, highlighting the chemical interactions between TCE and proton dynamics during the oxidation process. This relationship is quantitatively described in the equations provided, emphasizing the role of protons in the reaction kinetics of TCE."
