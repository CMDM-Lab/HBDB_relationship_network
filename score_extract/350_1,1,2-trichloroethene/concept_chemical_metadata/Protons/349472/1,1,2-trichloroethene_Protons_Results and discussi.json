    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in oxidation reactions where protons are produced as by-products. The acidity from proton production affects the reactivity of potassium permanganate during TCE oxidation. The addition of basic salts like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate helps buffer the pH, thereby influencing the oxidation rates of TCE. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE oxidation and proton generation, highlighting the importance of pH control in the reaction process."
