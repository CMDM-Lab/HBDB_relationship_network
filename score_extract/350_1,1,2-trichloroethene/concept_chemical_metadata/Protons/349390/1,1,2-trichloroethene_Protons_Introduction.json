    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in oxidation reactions facilitated by potassium permanganate (KMnO4), which generates protons (H+) as a byproduct. The oxidation of TCE leads to changes in pH due to the release of protons, which can influence the overall oxidation rates of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, the relationship is primarily focused on the chemical reactions rather than a direct interaction between TCE and protons themselves."
