    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to the chlorination process involving chromium and copper catalysts. The text discusses the interactions between chlorine atoms and these metals, indicating that chlorination affects the formation of metal chlorides and potentially oxychlorides. However, the relationship is not explicitly detailed regarding TCE's role in the chlorination process itself, as the focus is more on the catalyst's behavior during the reaction."
