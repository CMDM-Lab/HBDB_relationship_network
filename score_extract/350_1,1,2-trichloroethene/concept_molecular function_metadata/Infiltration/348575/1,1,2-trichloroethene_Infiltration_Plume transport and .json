    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its migration and dissolution processes affecting groundwater. The infiltration of TCE vapors into pore waters is highlighted as a significant pathway for VOC incorporation into groundwater, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and the infiltration process. The modeling studies referenced confirm that TCE's behavior in the unsaturated zone and its subsequent impact on groundwater are influenced by its volatilization and dissolution characteristics."
