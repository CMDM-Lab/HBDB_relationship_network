    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to infiltration rates within a stratigraphic unit that includes a low permeability clay layer. The study investigates how varying infiltration rates affect water saturation and the transport of TCE through the vadose zone. Increased infiltration rates are hypothesized to influence the movement of TCE, highlighting a connection between infiltration dynamics and the fate of this contaminant in the environment."
