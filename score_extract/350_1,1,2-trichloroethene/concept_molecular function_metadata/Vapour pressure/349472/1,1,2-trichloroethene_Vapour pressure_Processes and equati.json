    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its vapor pressure, which is used to determine the initial concentration of the compound in a simulation involving vapor diffusion through unsaturated soil. The vapor pressure of TCE is critical for understanding its behavior in environmental conditions, particularly in the context of its migration as a volatile organic compound (VOC). The relationship is significant as it directly influences the modeling of TCE's transport in the environment."
