    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is evaluated for its equilibrium sorption behavior on model soils using a sequential dosing method. The study highlights that TCE possesses a vapor pressure of at least 1 mm Hg at room temperature, which is a critical property for its use as a sorbate in obtaining vapor phase equilibrium isotherms. The relationship between TCE and vapor pressure is significant as it determines the conditions under which TCE can be effectively studied in sorption experiments."
