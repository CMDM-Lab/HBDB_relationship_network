    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its vapor pressure, which is a critical factor influencing its concentration in air. The study indicates that TCE's air phase concentration increases rapidly to its maximum, correlating with its vapor pressure. The similarity in vapor pressures and diffusion coefficients between TCE and toluene suggests a direct relationship, as both compounds exhibit comparable evaporation rates and concentration distributions over time. This highlights the importance of vapor pressure in understanding the behavior of TCE in environmental contexts."
