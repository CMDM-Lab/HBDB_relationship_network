    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as part of a gas mixture contained in a high-pressure gas cylinder, indicating that pressure is a physical agent used to maintain the desired concentrations of TCE and other gases. However, there is no detailed discussion of how pressure specifically affects TCE or its behavior in the system, making the relationship largely incidental."
