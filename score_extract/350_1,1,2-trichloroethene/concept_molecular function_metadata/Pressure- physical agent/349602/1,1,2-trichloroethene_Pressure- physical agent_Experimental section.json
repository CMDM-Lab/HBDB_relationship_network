    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed under specific pressure conditions during a gas analysis procedure. The relationship between TCE and pressure is critical, as the analysis involves measuring gas volume uptake based on pressure differentials. However, the context does not elaborate on the broader implications of pressure as a physical agent affecting TCE's properties or behavior beyond the analytical procedure."
