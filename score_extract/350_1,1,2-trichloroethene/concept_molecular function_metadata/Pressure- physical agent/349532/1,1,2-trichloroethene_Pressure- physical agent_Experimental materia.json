    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in an experimental setup where its evaporation and movement in contaminated sand layers are being quantified. The term 'pressure' refers to the physical conditions under which the TCE and water were allowed to establish equilibrium. However, there is no detailed discussion on how pressure specifically affects TCE behavior or its interactions with the sand, making the relationship indirect."
