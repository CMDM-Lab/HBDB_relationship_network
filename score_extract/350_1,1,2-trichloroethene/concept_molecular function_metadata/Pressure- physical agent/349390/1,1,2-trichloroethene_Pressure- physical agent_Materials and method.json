    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to VOC transport experiments, where the conditions, including pressure, are assumed to be constant at atmospheric levels. However, the relationship between TCE and pressure is not explicitly discussed, and pressure is treated as a physical condition rather than a factor influencing TCE behavior or properties. Thus, while both terms are present, their connection lacks depth and specificity."
