    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its behavior in solid-phase sorption and air-water interface interactions during experiments. However, there is no mention or connection to 'Adjudication,' which typically refers to a legal process or decision-making. Thus, the two terms appear unrelated within the provided context."
