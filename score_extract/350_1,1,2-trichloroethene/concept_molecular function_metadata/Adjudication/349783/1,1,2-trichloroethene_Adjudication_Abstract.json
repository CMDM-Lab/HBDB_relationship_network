    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to a study evaluating its kinetic constants and the efficiency of a vial equilibration method for pharmacokinetic modeling. However, there is no direct connection or discussion regarding 'adjudication' in relation to TCE, making their relationship unclear and coincidental at best."
