    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its dissolution rate into water, alongside toluene. However, the term 'Adjudication' appears without any direct connection to TCE or its dissolution process. There is no indication of how adjudication relates to the chemical properties or behaviors of TCE, making their relationship unclear and coincidental."
