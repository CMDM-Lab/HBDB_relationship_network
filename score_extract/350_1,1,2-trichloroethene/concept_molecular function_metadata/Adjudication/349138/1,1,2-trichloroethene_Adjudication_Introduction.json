    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its biodegradation in contaminated fractured shale aquifers. However, the term 'Adjudication' is not directly related to TCE or its biodegradation process. Instead, it appears to be a separate concept without any contextual linkage to the chemical processes or environmental assessments being described. Thus, there is no meaningful relationship between TCE and Adjudication in this context."
