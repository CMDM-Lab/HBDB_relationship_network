    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its presystemic elimination upon ingestion. The text highlights that while ingestion of TCE at low levels leads to minimal metabolism changes, the efficiency of presystemic elimination remains high. The study emphasizes the limited impact of ingestion on TCE metabolism compared to inhalation, suggesting that ingestion does not significantly alter the metabolic processing of TCE in the liver."
