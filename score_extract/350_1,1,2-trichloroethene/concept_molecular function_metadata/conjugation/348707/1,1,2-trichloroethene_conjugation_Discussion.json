    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is primarily metabolized in the liver through a CYP450-catalyzed pathway, leading to the formation of various metabolites. One of the minor pathways involves glutathione conjugation, which indicates a detoxification mechanism. This suggests that conjugation plays a role in the metabolic processing of TCE, although it is not the primary pathway. The relationship highlights the importance of conjugation in mitigating the potential toxicity of TCE metabolites."
