    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is primarily metabolized through a CYP450-catalyzed oxidative pathway, but it also undergoes conjugation with glutathione as a secondary metabolic route. This conjugation pathway becomes significant at higher doses of TCE, indicating its role in detoxification and metabolic activation. The relationship highlights the importance of conjugation in modulating TCE's toxicity and potential carcinogenic effects."
