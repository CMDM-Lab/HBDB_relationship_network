    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by a microbial strain (G4) and the influence of PM-100 clay on this process. However, the term 'Force' appears to refer to the driving force of equilibrium in the degradation process rather than a direct relationship with TCE. The context does not provide a clear or significant connection between TCE and the concept of force, as it primarily focuses on the degradation mechanisms and statistical analyses of TCE concentrations."
