    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its natural attenuation in groundwater, particularly in granular aquifer materials. The text highlights that while TCE and other chlorinated solvents can undergo natural attenuation, there is limited research on this process in fractured rock environments. The relationship suggests that TCE's degradation may be influenced by the physical and geochemical properties of the surrounding materials, indicating a potential but not fully explored connection between TCE and its attenuation mechanisms."
