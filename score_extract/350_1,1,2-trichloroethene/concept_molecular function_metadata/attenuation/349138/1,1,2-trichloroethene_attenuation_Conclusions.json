    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to natural attenuation processes, which include both anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation mechanisms. The presence of methanotrophs indicates that aerobic biodegradation may contribute to the attenuation of TCE in oxygenated zones. The study highlights the importance of understanding these natural attenuation processes in the context of TCE contamination in fractured shale bedrock, suggesting a significant relationship between TCE and its attenuation mechanisms."
