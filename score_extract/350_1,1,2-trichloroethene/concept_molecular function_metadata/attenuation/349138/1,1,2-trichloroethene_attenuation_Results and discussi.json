    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to natural attenuation processes, particularly under varying redox conditions. The anaerobic environment at the WAG5 site is conducive to the reductive dechlorination of TCE, leading to the formation of less chlorinated compounds. This suggests that attenuation mechanisms are at play, allowing for the transformation of TCE into less harmful substances, although the high methane concentrations complicate the assessment of these processes."
