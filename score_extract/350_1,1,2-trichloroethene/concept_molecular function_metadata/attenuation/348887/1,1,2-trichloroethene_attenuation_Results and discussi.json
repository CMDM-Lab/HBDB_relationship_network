    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation and attenuation in groundwater. The study indicates that TCE concentrations decline significantly over a distance due to various mechanisms, including degradation and dilution, contributing to the observed strong plume attenuation. This suggests a direct relationship between TCE and the processes that lead to its attenuation in the environment."
