    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its behavior in an aquifer system, particularly focusing on the mechanisms causing plume attenuation. The study aims to understand how TCE and its degradation products are distributed and how various hydrologic components contribute to the reduction of TCE mass as it moves through the subsurface environment. The emphasis is on identifying the processes that lead to the observed attenuation of TCE concentrations in the plume."
