    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation and the resulting attenuation of its concentrations in a groundwater plume. The study indicates that TCE undergoes transformation, leading to a significant reduction in its mass discharge over a distance, which is characterized as strong plume attenuation. This attenuation is quantitatively supported by monitoring data showing a decline in TCE concentrations, suggesting that degradation processes contribute to the observed mass loss in the plume."
