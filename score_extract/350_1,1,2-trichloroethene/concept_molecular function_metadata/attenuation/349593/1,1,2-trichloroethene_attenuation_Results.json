    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport and fate from a source zone to indoor air, with attenuation coefficients being a key factor in predicting indoor air concentrations. The J&E model's predictions are compared to the CompFlow Bio model, indicating that attenuation plays a significant role in understanding how TCE concentrations are affected by various environmental conditions. However, the specific interaction between TCE and attenuation is not deeply explored beyond its role in modeling air concentration predictions."
