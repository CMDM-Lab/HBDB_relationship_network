    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed in relation to its natural attenuation in groundwater. The study involves monitoring TCE concentrations and its degradation products to assess the effectiveness of remediation technologies. While TCE is a focus of the analysis, the term 'attenuation' refers to the process of reducing its concentration over time, indicating a relationship between TCE and its natural degradation mechanisms. However, the specifics of how attenuation occurs in relation to TCE are not deeply explored in the provided context."
