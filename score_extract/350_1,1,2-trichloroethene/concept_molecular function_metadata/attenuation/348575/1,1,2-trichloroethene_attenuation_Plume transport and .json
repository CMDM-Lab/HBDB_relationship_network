    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is indirectly related to the concept of attenuation through the study of volatile compounds like vinyl chloride (VC) in multi-contaminant plumes. The research highlights how VC can serve as a growth substrate for microbial communities that facilitate the aerobic degradation of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), including TCE. While TCE itself is not directly mentioned in relation to attenuation, the findings suggest that its degradation may be influenced by the presence of other substrates and microbial activity, indicating a potential pathway for attenuation in contaminated environments."
