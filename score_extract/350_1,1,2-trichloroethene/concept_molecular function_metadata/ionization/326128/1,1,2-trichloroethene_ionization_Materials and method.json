    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a photon ionization detector (PID). The ionization process is crucial for quantifying TCE as it volatilizes from the trap and is introduced into the GC. However, the relationship is primarily technical, focusing on the method of detection rather than a deeper chemical or biological interaction."
