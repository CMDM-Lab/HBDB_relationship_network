    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its first-pass elimination through the liver and lungs, with a focus on how a significant portion of orally ingested TCE is metabolized before it can be detected in exhaled breath. The study highlights the liver's role in removing TCE from the bloodstream, suggesting that exhalation may not be a significant route for TCE elimination in low concentrations, which has implications for understanding its potential cancer risks in other tissues."
