    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its metabolic activation and elimination processes in the lungs. The text indicates that exhalation plays a modest role in the presystemic elimination of TCE, while the primary mechanism for its removal is through first-pass hepatic uptake. This suggests that while exhalation is a factor in TCE elimination, it is not the dominant pathway."
