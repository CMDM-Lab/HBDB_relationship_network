    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to anaerobic biodegradation processes, including methanogenesis. The text discusses how different redox conditions, such as those found in anaerobic environments, can facilitate the transformation of chlorinated solvents like TCE. Methanogenesis is highlighted as one of the processes involved in the anaerobic degradation of TCE, indicating a direct relationship where methanogenic bacteria may play a role in the breakdown of this solvent under specific conditions."
