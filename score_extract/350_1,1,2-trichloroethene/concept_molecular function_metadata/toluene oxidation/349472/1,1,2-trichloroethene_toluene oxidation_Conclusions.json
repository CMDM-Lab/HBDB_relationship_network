    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene oxidation are discussed in relation to their oxidation rates and the influence of environmental factors such as pH. The simulation results indicate that TCE has a larger oxidation rate constant compared to toluene, but both are similarly affected by changes in pH during their oxidation processes. This suggests a comparative relationship in their oxidation behavior under varying conditions, although specific interactions between TCE and toluene are not detailed."
