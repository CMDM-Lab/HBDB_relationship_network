    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its presence in drinking water and its potential adverse effects on health. The study indicates that while TCE is commonly found in groundwater and can be detected in the blood of nonoccupationally exposed individuals, the low levels absorbed from drinking water are largely mitigated by first-pass hepatic and pulmonary elimination, which protects extrahepatic organs from significant adverse effects. Thus, the relationship between TCE and adverse effects is acknowledged, but the context suggests a protective mechanism against these effects at low exposure levels."
