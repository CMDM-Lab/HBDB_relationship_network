    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its bioavailability and potential adverse effects on extrahepatic tissues in rats following oral ingestion. The study indicates that even low doses of TCE can lead to adverse effects, contradicting earlier assumptions about the liver's ability to eliminate VOCs effectively. This suggests a significant concern regarding the toxicological impact of TCE, particularly at trace amounts, highlighting its potential health risks."
