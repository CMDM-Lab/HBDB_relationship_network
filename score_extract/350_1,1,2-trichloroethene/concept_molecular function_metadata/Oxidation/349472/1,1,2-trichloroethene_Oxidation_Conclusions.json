    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its oxidation process compared to ethanol and toluene. The oxidation rate constant for TCE is noted to be larger than that for ethanol and toluene, indicating that TCE undergoes oxidation more readily under certain conditions. However, the overall oxidized mass of ethanol vapor is higher than that of TCE and toluene, suggesting that while TCE may oxidize faster, the total amount oxidized is influenced by other factors such as pH and environmental conditions."
