    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a chemical reaction where its oxidation is modeled mathematically. The study discusses how changes in pH affect the reaction rate of TCE oxidation, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and the oxidation process. The equations provided suggest that the oxidation of TCE produces protons, which further influences the pH, demonstrating a clear interaction between TCE and oxidation dynamics."
