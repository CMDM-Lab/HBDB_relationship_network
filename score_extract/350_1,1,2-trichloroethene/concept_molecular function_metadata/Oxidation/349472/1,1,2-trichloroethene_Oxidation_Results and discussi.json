    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to oxidation processes occurring in a permeable reactive layer. The text indicates that the oxidation rate of TCE is influenced by the pH and basicity of the water phase, suggesting that the reactivity of TCE during oxidation experiments is affected by changes in proton concentrations. However, the focus is primarily on the oxidation of aromatic compounds like toluene, with TCE serving as a comparative example rather than the main subject of oxidation discussion."
