    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is directly related to oxidation through in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) remediation strategies. The oxidation process involves the use of permanganate as an oxidant to convert TCE into carbon dioxide and other byproducts. This demonstrates a clear and significant relationship between TCE and oxidation, as the effectiveness of the remediation relies on the oxidation of TCE to mitigate environmental contamination."
