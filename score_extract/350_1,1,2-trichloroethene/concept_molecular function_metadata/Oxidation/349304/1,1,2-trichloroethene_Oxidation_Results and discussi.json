    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its incomplete oxidation during a treatment process. The high concentrations of TCE observed suggest that the oxidation process was not fully effective, leading to significant amounts of TCE remaining in the treatment zone. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and oxidation, as the latter is crucial for reducing TCE levels in the environment."
