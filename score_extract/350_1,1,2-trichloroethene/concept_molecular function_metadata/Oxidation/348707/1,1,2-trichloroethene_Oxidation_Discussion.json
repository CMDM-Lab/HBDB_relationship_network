    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its oxidation by the enzyme CYP2E1, which is responsible for metabolizing TCE in both rats and humans. The text highlights the role of CYP2E1 in the efficient oxidation of TCE to chloral, indicating a significant biochemical interaction where TCE undergoes oxidation as part of its metabolic pathway. This relationship is crucial for understanding TCE's pharmacokinetics and its elimination from the body."
