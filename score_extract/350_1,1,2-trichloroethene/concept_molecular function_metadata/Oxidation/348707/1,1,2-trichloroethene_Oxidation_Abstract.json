    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is primarily metabolized through an oxidative pathway involving the CYP450 enzyme system, particularly CYP2E1. This oxidative metabolism is crucial for modulating TCE's toxicokinetics and toxicity. The initial oxidation step is significant for understanding TCE's biotransformation and its potential noncancer effects on various organs, highlighting the critical role of oxidation in TCE metabolism."
