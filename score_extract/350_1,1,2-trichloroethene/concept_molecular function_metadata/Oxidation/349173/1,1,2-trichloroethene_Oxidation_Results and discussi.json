    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (CTC) is discussed in relation to its oxidation processes during photodegradation experiments. The study analyzes the gas phase mechanisms of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like CTC, focusing on the identification of intermediate products formed during oxidation reactions. However, the specific oxidation pathways or mechanisms for CTC are not detailed, limiting the depth of the relationship."
