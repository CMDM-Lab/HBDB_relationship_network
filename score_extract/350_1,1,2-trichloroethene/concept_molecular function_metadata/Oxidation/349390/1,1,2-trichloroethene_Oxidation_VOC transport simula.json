    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its oxidation process, which produces protons as a byproduct. The discussion focuses on the diffusion and transport of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like TCE in different phases, indicating that oxidation is a relevant chemical transformation affecting TCE's behavior in the environment. However, the relationship is not deeply explored beyond this mention of oxidation as a process associated with TCE."
