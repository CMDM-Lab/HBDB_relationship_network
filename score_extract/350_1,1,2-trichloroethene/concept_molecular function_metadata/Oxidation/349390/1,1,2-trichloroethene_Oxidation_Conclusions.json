    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a reactive transport model where its oxidation is facilitated by potassium permanganate in the presence of varying pH levels. The study highlights the importance of oxidation in the degradation of TCE and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during their transport through soil and water phases, indicating a direct relationship between TCE and the oxidation process."
