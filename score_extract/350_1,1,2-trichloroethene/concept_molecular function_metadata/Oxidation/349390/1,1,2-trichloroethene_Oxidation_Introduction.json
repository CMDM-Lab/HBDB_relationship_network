    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can undergo oxidation using potassium permanganate in a permeable reactive barrier (HPRB) system. The oxidation process is part of a broader discussion on the effectiveness of HPRBs in treating VOCs in the unsaturated zone. However, the specific oxidation reaction for TCE is not detailed, and the focus is more on the general oxidation capabilities of the reactive barrier rather than a direct relationship with TCE itself."
