    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its oxidation by potassium permanganate, with the study modeling the oxidation rate of TCE and toluene. The results indicate that pH significantly influences the oxidation rate of TCE, suggesting a direct relationship between TCE and the oxidation process. However, the details of the oxidation mechanism or the specific outcomes of TCE oxidation are not elaborated upon."
