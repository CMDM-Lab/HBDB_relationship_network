    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to anaerobic biodegradation processes, including sulfate reduction. The text discusses various redox indicators involved in the transformation of chlorinated solvents, indicating that sulfate reduction is one of the mechanisms that may facilitate the degradation of TCE under anaerobic conditions. However, the specific interaction between TCE and sulfate reduction is not elaborated upon in detail."
