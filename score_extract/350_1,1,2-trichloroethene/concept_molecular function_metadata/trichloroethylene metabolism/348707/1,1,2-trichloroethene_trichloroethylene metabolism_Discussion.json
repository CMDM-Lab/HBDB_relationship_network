    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its metabolism in the liver, highlighting the role of CYP2E1 in the metabolic activation and inactivation of TCE. The text emphasizes the efficiency of presystemic elimination of TCE and the limited impact of variations in CYP2E1 activity on TCE metabolism, suggesting a direct relationship between TCE exposure and its metabolic processing in the liver. This indicates that understanding TCE metabolism is crucial for assessing its effects on human health."
