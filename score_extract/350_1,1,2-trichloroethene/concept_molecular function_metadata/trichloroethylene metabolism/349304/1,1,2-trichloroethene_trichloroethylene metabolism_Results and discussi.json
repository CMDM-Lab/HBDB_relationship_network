    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a contaminant in a bioremediation study, where its metabolism is indirectly referenced through the discussion of its daughter products and co-metabolism processes. While TCE is a precursor to other compounds, the specific metabolic pathways or interactions involving TCE and its transformation into other substances are not detailed, limiting the direct connection to trichloroethylene metabolism."
