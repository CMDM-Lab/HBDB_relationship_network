    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is indirectly related to trichloroethylene (TCE) metabolism through the discussion of metabolic rates and factors affecting TCE metabolism in various tissue fractions. The study highlights how different substrates and conditions can influence the metabolism of TCE, suggesting that 1,1,2-trichloroethene may share metabolic pathways or effects with TCE, although the specific relationship is not explicitly detailed."
