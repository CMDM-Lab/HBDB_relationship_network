    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is indirectly related to trichloroethylene (TCE) metabolism as TCE is used as a model chemical for studying enzyme kinetics in the gas-liquid system. The study focuses on the metabolic processes involving TCE, particularly its depletion in the presence of rat liver microsomes, which may also involve similar metabolic pathways for 1,1,2-trichloroethene. However, the specific relationship between the two compounds is not explicitly detailed."
