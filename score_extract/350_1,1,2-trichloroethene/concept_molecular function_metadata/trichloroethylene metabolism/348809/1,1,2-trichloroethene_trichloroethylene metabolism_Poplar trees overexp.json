    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is highlighted as a volatile toxic compound that is metabolized by transgenic plants engineered to overexpress cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). The study demonstrates that these genetically modified plants exhibit significantly enhanced metabolism of TCE, achieving over 100-fold higher metabolism rates compared to non-transgenic controls. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and its metabolism through the action of CYP2E1 in the engineered plants, showcasing the potential for bioremediation of TCE and similar compounds."
