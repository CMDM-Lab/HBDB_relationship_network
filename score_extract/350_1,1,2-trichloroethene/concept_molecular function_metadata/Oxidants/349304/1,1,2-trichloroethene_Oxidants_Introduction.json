    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is treated using in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) methods, where oxidants like permanganate are employed to remediate TCE contamination in groundwater. The oxidants facilitate the conversion of TCE into carbon dioxide and other byproducts, demonstrating a direct and critical relationship between TCE and oxidants in the remediation process."
