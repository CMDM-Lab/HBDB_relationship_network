    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its persistence in groundwater and the challenges of remediation. While oxidants are mentioned as part of the remediation strategy, there is no direct discussion of how oxidants specifically interact with TCE. The focus is more on the behavior of TCE in low-flow zones rather than its chemical relationship with oxidants."
