    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to oxidants, specifically oxygen (O2) and nitrate (NO3âˆ’), which are electron acceptors in the environment. The study indicates that as these oxidants are consumed, TCE begins to act as an electron acceptor, suggesting a shift in redox conditions that facilitates reductive dechlorination processes. This highlights a significant interaction where TCE's role is influenced by the presence and consumption of oxidants in the environment."
