    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its toxicokinetics, which refers to how the body processes and responds to the chemical. The text highlights the role of biotransformation in modulating TCE's toxicity and carcinogenicity, emphasizing the importance of metabolic pathways, particularly those involving the CYP450 enzyme system, in determining the effects of TCE exposure. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and toxicokinetics, as the metabolic processes influence the chemical's potential harmful effects on human health."
