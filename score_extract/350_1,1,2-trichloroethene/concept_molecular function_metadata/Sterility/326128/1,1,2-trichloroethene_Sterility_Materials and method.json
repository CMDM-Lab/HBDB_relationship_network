    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is being analyzed for its degradation in sterile conditions using PM-100 clay and a microbial culture (G4). The sterility of the medium is crucial for assessing the TCE-degrading ability of the G4 culture without interference from other microbial activity. However, the relationship between TCE and sterility is primarily procedural, focusing on maintaining sterile conditions for accurate experimental results rather than a direct interaction between the two."
