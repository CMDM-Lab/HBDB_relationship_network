    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a volatile organic compound (VOC) undergoing photodegradation, with comparisons made to other chlorohydrocarbons. The term 'catalyst' is referenced in relation to photocatalytic degradation processes, indicating that catalysts are used to enhance the degradation of compounds like benzene. However, there is no direct discussion of how TCE specifically interacts with or is affected by any catalysts in the degradation process."
