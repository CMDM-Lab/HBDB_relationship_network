    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a chlorinated volatile organic compound (Cl-VOC) used in a catalytic reaction process. The catalyst's performance is evaluated based on its ability to convert TCE and other Cl-VOCs into products, with parameters such as conversion rates and carbon dioxide yield being assessed. The relationship is primarily focused on the catalyst's effectiveness in facilitating the reaction involving TCE, indicating a direct functional connection between the two."
