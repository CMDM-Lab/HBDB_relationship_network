    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as a chlorinated volatile organic contaminant that is mitigated by a palladium/iron reactive granular material (Pd/Fe RGM), which acts as a catalyst in the transformation process. The effectiveness of this catalyst is influenced by factors such as aging and the formation of an iron oxide film, which can hinder its reactivity towards TCE. Thus, the relationship between TCE and the catalyst is significant, as the catalyst's performance directly impacts the degradation of TCE in the environment."
