    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to the reactivity of potassium permanganate during its oxidation. The study highlights that acidic conditions inhibit the oxidation rate of TCE, leading to the use of basic salts like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate as inhibitors to counteract this acidity. Thus, the relationship between TCE and inhibitors is centered on the need to mitigate the inhibitory effects of acidity on TCE oxidation."
