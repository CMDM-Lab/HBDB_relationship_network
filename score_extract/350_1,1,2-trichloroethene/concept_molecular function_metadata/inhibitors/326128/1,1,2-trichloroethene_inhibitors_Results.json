    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its degradation by a microbial strain (G4) and the impact of phenol as an inhibitor. The study indicates that at higher concentrations of phenol (1200ppm), TCE degradation is significantly inhibited, suggesting that phenol acts as an inhibitor to the microbial degradation process of TCE. However, the relationship between TCE and inhibitors is primarily focused on phenol's inhibitory effects rather than a broader discussion of inhibitors in general."
