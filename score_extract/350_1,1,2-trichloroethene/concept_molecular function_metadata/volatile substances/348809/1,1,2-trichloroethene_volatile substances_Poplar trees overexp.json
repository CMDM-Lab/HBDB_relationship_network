    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a volatile organic compound that is effectively metabolized by transgenic plants expressing CYP2E1. The study highlights the ability of these plants to extract and metabolize TCE and other volatile substances from contaminated environments, demonstrating a significant relationship between TCE and the broader category of volatile substances in terms of environmental remediation and pollutant management."
