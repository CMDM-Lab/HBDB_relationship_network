    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is mentioned as a volatile compound among others like chloroform and trichloroethylene, which are discussed in relation to their boiling points and the challenges of analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using large volume injection techniques. The focus is on the suitability of different solvents for extracting and analyzing these volatile substances, indicating that 1,1,2-trichloroethene is part of a broader category of volatile substances but lacks a specific interaction or detailed relationship with them."
