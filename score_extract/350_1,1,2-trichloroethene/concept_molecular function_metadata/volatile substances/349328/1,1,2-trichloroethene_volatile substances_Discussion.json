    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is identified as a highly volatile compound that migrates through soil and groundwater, affecting contaminant distributions. The study highlights the ability of trees to uptake and store TCE, indicating its classification as a volatile substance. The relationship is primarily based on TCE's volatility and its behavior in environmental matrices, particularly in relation to soil and tree cores."
