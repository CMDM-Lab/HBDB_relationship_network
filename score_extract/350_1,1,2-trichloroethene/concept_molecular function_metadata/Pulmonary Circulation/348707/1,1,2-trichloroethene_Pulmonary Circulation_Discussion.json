    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to its exhalation during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. The text discusses the hepatic clearance models for TCE and notes that while the gastrointestinal tract has minimal impact on TCE extraction, the compound is exhaled to some extent during its circulation through the lungs. This indicates a connection between TCE and pulmonary circulation, as the lungs play a role in the elimination of this volatile organic compound."
