    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is analyzed within a series of modified scenarios that impact its fate and transport in the environment, particularly concerning indoor air exposure. The modifications to the base scenario are described as processes that influence the hydrologic behavior of TCE, such as increasing infiltration rates, which subsequently affect the concentration of TCE in indoor air. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and the processes governing its environmental transport and exposure risk."
