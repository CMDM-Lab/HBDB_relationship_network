    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport and retention processes in water. The study highlights how TCE's behavior, including its partitioning into water and the influence of water content on its transport, is part of a broader process of understanding chemical retention in environmental studies. However, the term 'Process' is not explicitly defined or detailed, making the relationship somewhat vague."
