    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its vapor-phase transport and the various retention processes that influence its behavior in a porous medium. The study highlights how TCE's physicochemical properties affect its dissolution in water, accumulation at the air-water interface, and solid-phase sorption. However, the term 'Process' is too vague and does not specify a particular process related to TCE, making the connection less direct."
