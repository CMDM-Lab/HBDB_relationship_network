    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in experiments assessing its vapor concentration in relation to a permeable reactive layer process. The study examines how the injection of water affects the reactivity of this layer and the concentration of TCE vapor, indicating a relationship between the chemical behavior of TCE and the experimental process being utilized to analyze its reactivity and concentration changes over time."
