    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is involved in a process aimed at its destruction through non-thermal plasma techniques. The study focuses on the parameters affecting the destruction process of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like trichloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride, highlighting the role of microwave power and electron collisions in enhancing the efficiency of the decomposition process. The relationship is significant as it pertains to the methods used for VOC degradation."
