    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is discussed as a volatile organic compound (VOC) that is treated using a plasma torch process for its destruction in industrial settings. The process is highlighted for its efficiency in removing VOCs, including 1,1,2-trichloroethene, and the analysis of byproducts formed during this treatment indicates the effectiveness of the process. However, the relationship is primarily focused on the operational aspects of the process rather than a detailed interaction with the compound itself."
