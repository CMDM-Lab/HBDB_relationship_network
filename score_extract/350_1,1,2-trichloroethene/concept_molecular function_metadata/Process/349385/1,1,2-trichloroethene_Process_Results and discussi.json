    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a biological process of anaerobic dechlorination, where specific bacteria like Geobacter and Nitrosomonas play a crucial role in transforming TCE into less harmful compounds such as cis-DCE and VC. The study highlights the importance of these microbial processes in the degradation of TCE under fluctuating redox conditions in the aquifer, indicating a significant relationship between TCE and the biological processes involved in its degradation."
