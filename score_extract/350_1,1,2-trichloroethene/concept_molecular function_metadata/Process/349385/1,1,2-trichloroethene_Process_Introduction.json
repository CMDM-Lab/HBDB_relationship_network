    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned in relation to microbial communities and their role in the biodegradation processes of chlorinated contaminants. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding these microbial processes rather than focusing solely on individual microorganisms. However, the specific relationship between TCE and the broader concept of 'Process' is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is on microbial interactions and degradation mechanisms rather than a defined process involving TCE."
