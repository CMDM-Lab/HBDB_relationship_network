    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in a thermal process where it undergoes evaporation and condensation due to temperature changes during steam injection. The heating of sand layers enhances TCE evaporation, and the vapor is carried away by air, while some TCE condenses at the steam front. This illustrates TCE's role in a specific environmental remediation process, highlighting its behavior under thermal conditions."
