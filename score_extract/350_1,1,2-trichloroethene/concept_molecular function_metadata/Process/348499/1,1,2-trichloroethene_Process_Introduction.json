    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its environmental impact, particularly its ability to permeate through high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes used for containing hazardous waste. The process of partition-diffusion is highlighted as a mechanism by which TCE contaminates groundwater, prompting research into methods to mitigate this mass transfer. The relationship emphasizes the need for effective processes to prevent TCE contamination in environmental management."
