    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its metabolic activation and elimination processes in the body, particularly focusing on the role of various cytochrome P450 enzymes in its oxidation. The term 'Process' refers to the metabolic and environmental processes involved in TCE's behavior, including its first-pass hepatic uptake and the dynamics of its remediation in groundwater. However, the relationship is not deeply explored, and the term 'Process' is used more generally without specific details on how it directly relates to TCE."
