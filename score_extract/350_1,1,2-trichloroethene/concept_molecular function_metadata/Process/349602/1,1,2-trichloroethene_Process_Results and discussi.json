    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its transport and sorption behavior in materials coated with humic acid. The modeling results indicate that TCE transport is a slower, relaxation-controlled process in these materials, suggesting that the presence of humic acid does not significantly alter TCE's sorption characteristics. The relationship highlights the importance of understanding the diffusion processes involved in TCE transport within different material systems, but does not delve into specific processes beyond this general observation."
