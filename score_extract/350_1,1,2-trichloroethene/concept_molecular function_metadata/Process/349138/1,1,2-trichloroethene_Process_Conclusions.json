    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to natural attenuation processes involving its biodegradation. The study highlights mechanisms such as aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation, suggesting that these processes are crucial for the breakdown of TCE and its byproducts in a hydrogeologically complex environment. The mention of 'process' refers to the various biodegradation mechanisms that facilitate the natural attenuation of TCE, indicating a significant relationship between the compound and the processes involved in its degradation."
