    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is involved in the anaerobic biodegradation process, where it is converted to cDCE and subsequently to VC. The dechlorination process is highlighted as a key mechanism in the breakdown of TCE in groundwater, indicating that TCE's transformation is integral to the overall biodegradation process. The study emphasizes the importance of this pathway in understanding the natural attenuation of TCE contamination."
