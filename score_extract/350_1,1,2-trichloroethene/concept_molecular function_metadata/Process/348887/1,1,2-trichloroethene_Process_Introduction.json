    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to the processes involved in its degradation and attenuation within a hydrogeologic system. The study aims to understand the mechanisms affecting TCE mass discharge from a subsurface source through an aquifer to a river, highlighting the processes that influence the fate of TCE and its degradation products in the environment. However, the term 'Process' is used broadly without specific details on the exact processes being examined."
