    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is studied to evaluate its metabolic rates in rat hepatic microsomal preparations. The research aims to determine TCE metabolic rate constants and assess how different fatty acids influence its metabolism. This indicates a direct relationship between TCE and metabolic rates, as the study focuses on quantifying the metabolism of TCE and its interactions with various substrates and enzymes."
