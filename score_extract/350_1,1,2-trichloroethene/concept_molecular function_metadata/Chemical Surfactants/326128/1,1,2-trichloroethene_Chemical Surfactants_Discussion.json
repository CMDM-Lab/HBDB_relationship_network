    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is discussed in relation to its adsorption and desorption behavior on PM-100 clay, with a mention of synthetic surfactants potentially enhancing the desorption rate of TCE. However, the specific impact of chemical surfactants on TCE degradation or its interaction with G4 is not clearly defined, indicating a limited but possible connection between TCE and surfactants in the context of environmental remediation."
