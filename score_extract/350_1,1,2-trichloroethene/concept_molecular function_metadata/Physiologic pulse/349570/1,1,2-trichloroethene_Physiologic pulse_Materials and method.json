    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene (TCE) is mentioned as part of a gas injection experiment in a lysimeter setup, where a pulse of gas containing TCE is introduced into the system. However, there is no direct connection or relevance to the concept of 'physiologic pulse,' which typically refers to the rhythmic expansion and contraction of arteries with each heartbeat. The two terms appear in the same context but do not interact or relate to each other functionally or conceptually."
