    "summary": "In this context, 1,1,2-trichloroethene is indirectly related to degreasers through its association with trichloroethylene (TCE), which is explicitly identified as a degreaser or solvent. TCE is frequently detected in contaminated sites and is known for its adverse health effects, including potential carcinogenicity. The mention of TCE as a degreaser highlights the functional role of chlorinated volatile organic compounds in industrial applications, particularly in cleaning and degreasing processes."
