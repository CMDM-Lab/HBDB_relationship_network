    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is implicated in respiratory physiology due to its association with occupational lung diseases, particularly obliterative bronchiolitis among workers exposed to flavoring agents. The study highlights the need for medical surveillance and exposure reduction to mitigate respiratory health risks linked to diacetyl exposure, indicating a direct relationship between the compound and respiratory function outcomes."
