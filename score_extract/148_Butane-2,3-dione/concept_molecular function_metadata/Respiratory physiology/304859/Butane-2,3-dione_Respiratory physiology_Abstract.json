    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is indirectly related to respiratory physiology through its mention in the study of lung function and exposure in a flavoring manufacturing facility. The study focuses on the effects of transitioning away from diacetyl towards substitutes, highlighting concerns about respiratory health among workers. While the relationship is relevant, it is not deeply explored in terms of specific physiological impacts or mechanisms related to Butane-2,3-dione."
