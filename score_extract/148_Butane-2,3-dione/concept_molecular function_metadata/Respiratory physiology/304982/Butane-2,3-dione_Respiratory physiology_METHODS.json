    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is indirectly related to respiratory physiology through its association with lung function variables among workers in a diacetyl plant. The study assesses the impact of occupational exposure to diacetyl on lung function, indicating potential respiratory health risks. However, the specific physiological mechanisms or direct effects of Butane-2,3-dione on respiratory physiology are not detailed."
