    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to respiratory physiology through its association with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome observed in workers exposed to this flavoring chemical. The study investigates the respiratory symptoms and lung function of workers, indicating that diacetyl exposure may lead to significant respiratory health issues, highlighting the need for reduced exposure to such chemicals in occupational settings."
