    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to respiratory physiology through its association with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), also known as 'popcorn worker's lung.' The study highlights the adverse effects of diacetyl exposure on lung function, particularly in workers exposed to butter-flavouring chemicals, indicating a clear relationship between diacetyl inhalation and respiratory health outcomes, including airway obstruction and reduced forced expiratory volume (FEV1)."
