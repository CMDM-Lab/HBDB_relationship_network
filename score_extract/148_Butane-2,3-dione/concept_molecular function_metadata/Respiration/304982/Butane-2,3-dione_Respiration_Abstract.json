    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to respiratory health, as workers exposed to it reported significantly more respiratory symptoms compared to both the general population and a minimally exposed internal reference group. The study highlights a concerning association between diacetyl exposure and increased prevalence of respiratory issues, suggesting that diacetyl poses an occupational hazard affecting respiration."
