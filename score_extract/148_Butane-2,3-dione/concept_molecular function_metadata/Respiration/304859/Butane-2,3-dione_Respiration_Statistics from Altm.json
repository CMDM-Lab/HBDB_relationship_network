    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is linked to respiratory health, particularly concerning its association with obliterative bronchiolitis due to occupational exposure in industries like popcorn and coffee processing. The respiratory toxicity of diacetyl has been confirmed in laboratory models, indicating its harmful effects on lung function and the necessity for exposure reduction measures to protect respiratory health."
