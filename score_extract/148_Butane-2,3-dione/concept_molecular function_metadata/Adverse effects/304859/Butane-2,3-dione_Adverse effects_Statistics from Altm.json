    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is linked to adverse respiratory effects, particularly obliterative bronchiolitis, in workers exposed to flavoring chemicals. The text emphasizes that reducing exposure to diacetyl alone may not suffice to mitigate respiratory risks, indicating a broader concern for other flavoring agents and their potential adverse effects on lung function."
