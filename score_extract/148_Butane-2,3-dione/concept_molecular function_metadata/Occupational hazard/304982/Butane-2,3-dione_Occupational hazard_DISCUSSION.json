    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is identified as an occupational hazard, particularly for workers in a popcorn plant. The study highlights that process operators exposed to diacetyl exhibited significantly more respiratory symptoms and a notable decrease in pulmonary function compared to other occupational groups. This establishes a clear link between diacetyl exposure and adverse respiratory health outcomes, reinforcing its classification as an occupational hazard."
