    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is identified as a significant occupational hazard for workers exposed to it, particularly in the production of microwave popcorn. The study highlights a marked increase in respiratory symptoms among diacetyl workers compared to the general population, indicating a direct link between diacetyl exposure and adverse respiratory health outcomes, including asthma and chronic breathing issues. This establishes diacetyl as a critical occupational health risk."
