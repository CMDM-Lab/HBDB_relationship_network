    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly mentioned in relation to vital capacity. The focus is on spirometry testing and definitions of respiratory patterns, including obstructive and restrictive abnormalities based on FEV1 and FVC measurements. There is no discussion of how Butane-2,3-dione may affect vital capacity or respiratory function, indicating a lack of direct relevance between the two terms."
