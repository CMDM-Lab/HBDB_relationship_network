    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly mentioned in relation to obstruction. The focus is on defining and classifying respiratory conditions based on spirometry results, specifically obstruction as indicated by FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratios. There is no discussion of Butane-2,3-dione's role or impact on respiratory obstruction, making their relationship unclear."
