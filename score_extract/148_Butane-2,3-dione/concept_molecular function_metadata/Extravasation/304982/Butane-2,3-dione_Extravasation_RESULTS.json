    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to exposure incidents among laboratory workers, but there is no direct discussion of its relationship with extravasation. The text primarily focuses on exposure incidents and respiratory symptoms without linking diacetyl to extravasation or detailing any physiological mechanisms that would connect the two terms."
