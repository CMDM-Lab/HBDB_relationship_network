    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to sensory defects in non-sterilized pork samples. The presence of diacetyl, along with other volatile organic compounds, is associated with spoilage in non-sterile conditions. However, the relationship between diacetyl and sterility is not explicitly detailed, as the focus is more on spoilage rather than a direct impact of diacetyl on sterility itself."
