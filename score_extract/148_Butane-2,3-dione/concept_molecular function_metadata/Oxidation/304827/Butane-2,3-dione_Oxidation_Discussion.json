    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is not explicitly mentioned, but the discussion revolves around the oxidation of lipids in pork meat, which leads to the production of various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as hexanal and 1-octen-3-ol. While oxidation is a key process affecting the quality and spoilage of meat, the specific role of Butane-2,3-dione in this oxidation process is not detailed, indicating a lack of direct connection between the two terms."
