    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to pulmonary function, specifically regarding its exposure among process operators in a diacetyl plant. While there was a borderline significant association with cough symptoms, the analysis did not find a clear link between diacetyl exposure and forced expiratory volume (FEV1). The study indicates some increase in FEV1 among workers, but the relationship with diacetyl exposure remains inconclusive, suggesting that other factors may influence pulmonary function."
