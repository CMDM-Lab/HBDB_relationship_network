    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is discussed in relation to its production process and the exposure of process operators to this compound. The study examines the health effects of diacetyl exposure during its production, particularly focusing on respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function. However, the term 'process' is used broadly to refer to the production environment without detailing specific interactions or mechanisms involving diacetyl, limiting the depth of their relationship."
