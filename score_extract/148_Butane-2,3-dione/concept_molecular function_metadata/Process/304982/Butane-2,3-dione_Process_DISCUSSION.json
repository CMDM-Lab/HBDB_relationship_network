    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to a specific process associated with respiratory hazards in a workplace setting. The study highlights the risks of diacetyl exposure, particularly in relation to the production process that may lead to severe cases of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). The mention of a process indicates that the handling or production of diacetyl is critical to understanding the associated health risks."
