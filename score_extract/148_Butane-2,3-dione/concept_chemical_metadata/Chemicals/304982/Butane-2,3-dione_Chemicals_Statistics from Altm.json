    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is identified as a significant chemical associated with occupational lung disease, specifically bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) among workers in the microwave popcorn industry. The relationship is highlighted through evidence of exposure-response correlations between diacetyl levels and respiratory health outcomes, indicating its harmful effects as a chemical in flavoring agents. Thus, Butane-2,3-dione is a specific example of a chemical that poses health risks in certain occupational settings."
