    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and n-hexanal are both mentioned as volatile compounds associated with the spoilage of pork. However, their specific relationship is not directly discussed. While hexanal is noted for its presence in both fresh and spoiled meat, Butane-2,3-dione is not explicitly linked to spoilage mechanisms or odor contributions in the provided text. Thus, their connection remains unclear and indirect."
