    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and n-hexanal are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) identified and quantified during the gas chromatography (GC) analysis of meat samples. However, the context does not provide any specific information about their interactions, functional relationships, or comparative significance in the study, indicating they are merely part of a broader analysis of VOCs in food spoilage."
