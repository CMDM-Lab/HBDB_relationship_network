    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and n-hexanal are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in pork samples analyzed for sensory spoilage. While both compounds are included in the analysis of VOCs, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between them. Instead, they are part of a broader study examining the correlation of various VOCs with bacterial levels in pork, with diacetyl showing a stronger correlation with aerobic bacteria than n-hexanal."
