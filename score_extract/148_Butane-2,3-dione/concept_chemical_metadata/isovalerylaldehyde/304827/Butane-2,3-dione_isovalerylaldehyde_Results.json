    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and isovalerylaldehyde are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed in relation to sensory assessments of pork samples. However, the context primarily focuses on diacetyl's correlation with bacterial levels, without establishing a direct relationship or interaction between Butane-2,3-dione and isovalerylaldehyde. Their mention is more about their presence in the same analysis rather than a specific functional or chemical relationship."
