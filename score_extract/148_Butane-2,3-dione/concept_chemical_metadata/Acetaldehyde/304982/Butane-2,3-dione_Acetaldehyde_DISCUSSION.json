    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and acetaldehyde are both mentioned as chemicals to which process operators were potentially exposed during diacetyl production. However, the context does not provide a direct relationship or interaction between the two compounds, merely indicating their presence in the same occupational environment. The focus is primarily on the exposure levels and their potential effects on pulmonary function, rather than any specific biochemical interaction between the two substances."
