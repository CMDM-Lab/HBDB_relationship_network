    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and acetaldehyde are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) monitored for exposure in a production environment. The study highlights that control measures implemented in 2001 significantly reduced exposure levels for both compounds. However, the relationship between them is primarily based on their co-occurrence in the workplace and the shared context of exposure monitoring rather than any direct chemical interaction or metabolic relationship."
