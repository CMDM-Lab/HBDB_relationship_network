    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) is mentioned in relation to workers in a diacetyl production plant, while coal is referenced in the context of using spirometric reference values from the European Community for Steel and Coal. However, there is no direct discussion of a relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and coal, as they are mentioned in separate contexts without any indication of interaction or relevance to each other."
