    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and 2-pentanone are both mentioned as reference compounds used in the identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in meat samples analyzed by gas chromatography. However, there is no detailed discussion of their specific interactions or functional relationships, indicating they are simply part of a broader analysis of VOCs without a direct connection between them."
