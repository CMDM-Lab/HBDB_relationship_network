    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) and 2-pentanone are both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected in pork samples. While the study notes that concentrations of various VOCs, including 2-pentanone, increased during storage, it specifically associates the increase of Butane-2,3-dione with bacterial growth. However, there is no direct interaction or comparative analysis between the two compounds, indicating they are part of a broader analysis of VOCs in meat rather than having a specific relationship."
