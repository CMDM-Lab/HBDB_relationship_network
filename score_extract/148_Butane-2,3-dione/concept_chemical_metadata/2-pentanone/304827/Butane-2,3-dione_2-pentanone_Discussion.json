    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione and 2-pentanone are both mentioned as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with the storage and spoilage of pork meat. While 2-pentanone is specifically noted to increase during storage, Butane-2,3-dione is not directly discussed in relation to spoilage or oxidation processes. Their relationship is implied through their shared context as VOCs in food quality assessment, but no direct interaction or comparative analysis is provided."
