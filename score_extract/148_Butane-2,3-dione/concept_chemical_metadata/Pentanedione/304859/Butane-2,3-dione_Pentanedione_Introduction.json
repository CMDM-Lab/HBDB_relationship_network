    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) and Pentanedione are both mentioned as compounds relevant to respiratory health in flavoring manufacturing workers. The study highlights a transition from diacetyl to 2,3-pentanedione as a substitute in the workplace. While both compounds are diketones and may have similar health implications, the focus is on the shift in usage rather than a direct comparison of their effects or interactions."
