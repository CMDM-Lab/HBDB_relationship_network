    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (also known as diacetyl) and isopentyl alcohol (3-methyl-1-butanol) are both mentioned as compounds produced by Pseudomonas phosphoreum during bacterial growth in pork spoilage. While both compounds are associated with sensory defects in food, the context does not provide a direct interaction or detailed relationship between them, merely indicating their co-occurrence in spoilage processes."
