    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is identified as a significant volatile metabolite produced by bacteria such as B. thermosphacta and LAB in pork under aerobic conditions. The study highlights the role of diacetyl and its reduction product, acetoin, as key metabolites associated with bacterial growth in meat, indicating their importance in the metabolic processes occurring during meat storage and spoilage."
