    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is analyzed using dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) cartridges for exposure monitoring in a diacetyl plant. DNPH is employed to capture and quantify carbonyl compounds like diacetyl and acetaldehyde through gas chromatography. This indicates a direct analytical relationship where DNPH serves as a reagent for detecting Butane-2,3-dione in occupational exposure assessments."
