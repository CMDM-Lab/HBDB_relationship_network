    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to respiratory symptoms among workers exposed to it. The study reports a significant increase in the prevalence of asthma attacks among diacetyl workers compared to both the general population and minimally exposed internal reference groups. This suggests a direct association between diacetyl exposure and the incidence of asthma attacks, highlighting its potential as an occupational hazard."
