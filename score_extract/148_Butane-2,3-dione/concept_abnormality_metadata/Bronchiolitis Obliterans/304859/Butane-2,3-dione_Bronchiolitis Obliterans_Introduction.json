    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned as a substitute for diacetyl, a compound linked to respiratory toxicity, specifically obliterative bronchiolitis in flavoring manufacturing workers. The study highlights cases of bronchiolitis obliterans associated with flavoring chemicals, suggesting a potential relationship between exposure to Butane-2,3-dione and respiratory health issues, although the direct impact of Butane-2,3-dione on bronchiolitis obliterans is not explicitly established."
