    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is directly linked to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans among workers in a flavoring manufacturing facility. The study indicates that exposure to diacetyl is associated with respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, with specific cases of bronchiolitis obliterans identified among workers. This suggests a significant occupational health risk related to diacetyl exposure, warranting further investigation and preventive measures."
