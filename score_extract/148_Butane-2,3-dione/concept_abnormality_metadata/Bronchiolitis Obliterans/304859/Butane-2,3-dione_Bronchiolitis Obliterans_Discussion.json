    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione is mentioned as a chemically related substitute to diacetyl, which is known to be a respiratory toxin linked to obliterative bronchiolitis. The text suggests that flavoring chemicals, including Butane-2,3-dione, should be treated with caution due to potential respiratory toxicity, indicating a possible association with bronchiolitis obliterans and other lung diseases. However, the specific relationship between Butane-2,3-dione and bronchiolitis obliterans is not explicitly detailed, leaving the connection somewhat implied rather than directly established."
