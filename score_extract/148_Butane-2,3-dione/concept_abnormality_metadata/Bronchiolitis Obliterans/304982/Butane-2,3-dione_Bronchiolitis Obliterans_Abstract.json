    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is directly linked to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans among workers exposed to this flavoring chemical. The study indicates that symptoms and lung function abnormalities observed in the workforce are consistent with undiagnosed bronchiolitis obliterans, highlighting the need for reduced exposure to diacetyl and its substitutes to prevent respiratory diseases."
