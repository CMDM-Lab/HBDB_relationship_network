    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione (diacetyl) is linked to airway obstruction through its role as a predominant chemical in butter flavoring, which has been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in workers exposed to it. The study indicates a clear exposure-response relationship, where higher cumulative exposure to diacetyl correlates with increased prevalence of abnormal lung function and respiratory symptoms, including airway obstruction. This suggests that diacetyl exposure is a significant risk factor for developing airway obstruction in affected workers."
