    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to respiratory symptoms, including asthma, among workers exposed to it. The study reports a significantly higher prevalence of asthma attacks and doctor-diagnosed asthma in diacetyl-exposed workers compared to both the general population and minimally exposed groups. This suggests a direct association between diacetyl exposure and increased asthma-related respiratory issues."
