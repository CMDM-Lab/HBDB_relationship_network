    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is linked to respiratory symptoms, including asthma, among workers exposed to it in a popcorn plant. The study indicates that process operators exposed to diacetyl exhibited significantly more respiratory symptoms and a decrease in pulmonary function, suggesting a potential occupational hazard related to asthma. The findings highlight a concerning relationship between diacetyl exposure and respiratory health outcomes, including asthma-like symptoms."
