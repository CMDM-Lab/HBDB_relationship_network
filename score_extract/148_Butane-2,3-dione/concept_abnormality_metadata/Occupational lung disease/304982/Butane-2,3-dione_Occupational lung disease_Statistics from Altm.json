    "summary": "In this context, Butane-2,3-dione, also known as diacetyl, is directly linked to occupational lung disease, specifically bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), commonly referred to as 'popcorn worker's lung.' The text discusses the exposure-response relationship between cumulative diacetyl exposure and abnormal lung function among workers in the microwave popcorn industry, indicating a significant health risk associated with inhalation of this chemical. The findings highlight the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction in workers exposed to diacetyl, establishing a clear connection between the chemical and occupational lung disease."
